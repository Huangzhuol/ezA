New York Governing Law,92b8288812,"The laws of the State of New York (excluding any laws that direct the application of another jurisdiction's law) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.","The clause you provided is a **New York Governing Law** provision, which directly addresses your query by specifying that the laws of the State of New York will govern the agreement. Here’s how it is relevant:

1. **Scope of Application**  
   The clause states that New York law governs **all matters** arising from or related to the agreement, including:  
   - Validity (whether the contract is legally binding)  
   - Interpretation (how terms are understood)  
   - Construction (how terms are analyzed legally)  
   - Performance (how parties fulfill obligations)  
   - Enforcement (how breaches or disputes are resolved)  

2. **Exclusion of Conflict-of-Law Rules**  
   The clause explicitly **excludes** any New York laws that might otherwise apply the laws of another jurisdiction (e.g., under conflict-of-law principles like the ""most significant relationship"" test). This ensures that **only New York substantive law** applies, avoiding uncertainty.  

3. **Transactional Coverage**  
   It covers not just the agreement itself but also **all contemplated transactions**, meaning related dealings (e.g., payments, deliverables) fall under New York law.  

4. **Purpose & Relevance to Your Query**  
   - **Predictability**: Parties know exactly which law will apply, reducing litigation risks.  
   - **Neutrality**: If parties are from different states/countries, choosing New York (a common commercial law jurisdiction) provides a neutral framework.  
   - **Enforceability**: New York courts are experienced in complex commercial disputes, making this choice practical for enforcement.  

This clause is standard in contracts where parties want clarity and consistency in legal interpretation, particularly in interstate or international agreements. Would you like any refinements or additional details?",5
New York Governing Law,149cfa46e3,"Any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including to its execution, performance or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof.","The clause you provided is a **New York Governing Law** provision, which directly addresses your query. Here’s how it is relevant:

1. **Specifies Applicable Law**:  
   The clause explicitly states that the laws of the State of New York will govern any disputes related to the agreement, including its execution, performance, or enforcement. This ensures predictability and consistency in legal interpretation.

2. **Overrides Conflict of Laws Principles**:  
   The phrase *""regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof""* means that even if another jurisdiction’s laws might apply under general conflict-of-laws rules (such as where the parties are located or where the contract was signed), New York law will still control.

3. **Broad Scope of Coverage**:  
   The clause covers not just disputes over the agreement’s terms but also matters related to its formation (*execution*), implementation (*performance*), and enforcement (e.g., remedies for breach).

4. **Purpose in Contracts**:  
   Including such a clause is common in commercial contracts to provide clarity, avoid uncertainty, and align with New York’s well-developed business laws and courts, which are often preferred in complex transactions.

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause ensures that New York law will exclusively apply to all aspects of the agreement, overriding any other potentially applicable laws, thereby providing legal certainty for the parties.",5
New York Governing Law,a75e169141,"This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York.","The clause **""This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York""** is directly responsive to the query about **""New York Governing Law""** because it explicitly establishes that:  

1. **Governing Law** – The agreement will be interpreted and enforced based on the laws of New York, regardless of where the parties are located or where disputes arise.  
2. **Jurisdictional Clarity** – Any legal disputes related to the contract will likely be resolved under New York state law (unless federal law preempts it).  
3. **Construction of Terms** – Ambiguities or disputes over the contract’s meaning will be resolved using New York’s legal principles and precedents.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause ensures predictability for the parties by selecting a specific legal framework (New York law), which is particularly important if the contract involves interstate or international parties.  
- It avoids conflicts over which jurisdiction’s laws apply, streamlining dispute resolution.

New York Governing Law,f3887246bf,"The laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.","This clause directly addresses the **""New York Governing Law""** query by explicitly stating that the laws of the State of New York will govern the agreement. Here’s how it aligns with the query and its key implications:

1. **Governing Law Specification**  
   - The clause clearly designates **New York law** as the applicable legal framework for the agreement, answering the query about which jurisdiction's laws will control.

2. **Scope of Application**  
   - It covers **all matters** related to the agreement, including:  
     - Validity (whether the contract is legally binding).  
     - Interpretation (how terms are understood).  
     - Construction (how terms are analyzed).  
     - Performance (execution of obligations).  
     - Enforcement (remedies for breaches).  

3. **Exclusion of Conflicts of Laws**  
   - The phrase **""without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles""** ensures that only **New York substantive law** applies, even if another jurisdiction’s laws might otherwise be relevant under traditional conflict-of-laws rules (e.g., where performance occurs outside New York). This prevents courts from applying another state’s or country’s laws.

4. **Transactional Coverage**  
   - The clause extends to **all transactions contemplated** by the agreement, ensuring consistency in legal treatment for related activities (e.g., payments, disputes, amendments).

### Why This Matters for the Query  
- **Predictability**: Parties know disputes will be resolved under New York law, reducing uncertainty.  
- **Neutrality**: New York is a common choice for its well-developed commercial law and experienced judiciary.  
- **Intentional Avoidance of Other Laws**: By rejecting conflicts principles, the parties avoid unintended application of foreign laws.  

In summary, this clause **explicitly selects New York law as the governing standard** and limits legal variability, which is precisely what the query seeks to confirm.",5
New York Governing Law,843fbeb743,"This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to conflict of laws principles. Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction in New York and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought in a court in New York City, NY.","This clause directly addresses the **""New York Governing Law""** query by specifying that the agreement is subject to the laws of the State of New York and outlines key legal implications. Here’s how it aligns with the query:  

1. **Governing Law**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the agreement is governed by **New York State law**, meaning any disputes or interpretations of the contract will be resolved under New York statutes and case law.  

2. **Exclusion of Conflict of Laws**  
   - The phrase **""without giving effect to conflict of laws principles""** ensures that only New York law applies, even if another jurisdiction’s laws might otherwise be relevant (e.g., if one party is based elsewhere).  

3. **Jurisdiction and Venue**  
   - The clause mandates that both parties **submit to personal jurisdiction in New York** and requires any legal disputes to be filed **exclusively in New York City courts**. This prevents either party from litigating in another state or country.  

### Relevance to the Query  
The clause comprehensively answers the query by:  
- Designating New York as the controlling legal framework.  
- Clarifying where disputes must be resolved (New York City).  
- Eliminating ambiguity by rejecting conflict-of-laws rules that might pull in other jurisdictions.  

This ensures predictability and consistency in enforcing the agreement under New York law.",5
England Governing Law,7511a4e3af,This agreement shall be governed by the Laws of England (English common and statutory Law).,"The clause **""This agreement shall be governed by the Laws of England (English common and statutory Law)""** is directly responsive to the query about **""England Governing Law""** in the following ways:

1. **Specifies the Applicable Legal System**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the agreement will be interpreted, enforced, and governed by **English law**, including both **common law** (judge-made precedents) and **statutory law** (legislation passed by Parliament). This ensures clarity about which jurisdiction's legal principles apply to disputes or interpretations of the contract.

2. **Determines Jurisdiction for Disputes**:  
   - While not explicitly mentioning jurisdiction (court venue), a choice of English law often implies that disputes may be resolved in English courts unless another forum is specified. Parties may still need a separate **jurisdiction clause** to confirm this.

3. **Avoids Conflict of Laws**:  
   - By selecting English law, the clause prevents ambiguity about which country's laws would apply if the parties are from different jurisdictions or if the contract has cross-border elements.

4. **Aligns with English Legal Principles**:  
   - English contract law is widely respected for its predictability and neutrality, making it a common choice in international agreements. The clause ensures that contractual rights and obligations are assessed under English legal doctrines (e.g., precedent, contractual interpretation rules).

5. **Excludes Other Laws**:  
   - The phrase excludes the application of laws from other jurisdictions (e.g., Scotland, which has a mixed legal system, or non-UK laws), unless expressly incorporated.

### Practical Relevance:  
- If a dispute arises, courts or arbitrators will apply **English law** to interpret the contract’s terms, assess breaches, or determine remedies.  
- Parties should ensure consistency with other clauses (e.g., dispute resolution) to avoid conflicts (e.g., choosing English law but foreign arbitration).

England Governing Law,7e61b9aeb0,This Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales.,"The clause **""This Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales.""** is directly responsive to the query about **""England Governing Law""** because it explicitly specifies that the legal framework for interpreting, enforcing, and resolving disputes related to the contract will be the laws of **England and Wales**. Here’s why this is relevant:

1. **Jurisdictional Clarity**:  
   - The clause confirms that English law (including Welsh law, as they share a legal system) will apply to the agreement, regardless of where the parties are based or where disputes might arise.  
   - This avoids ambiguity about which legal principles or statutes govern the contract.

2. **Dispute Resolution**:  
   - If a dispute arises, courts (or arbitrators) will apply English/Welsh law to interpret the contract’s terms and assess claims.  
   - It may also influence which courts have jurisdiction (unless another clause specifies venue/forum).

3. **Legal Compliance**:  
   - The parties agree to adhere to English/Welsh legal requirements (e.g., contract formation rules, statutory protections, or mandatory provisions under English law).  

4. **International Contracts**:  
   - For cross-border agreements, this clause ensures predictability by selecting a neutral or preferred legal system (common in commercial contracts due to England’s well-developed contract law).  

### Key Implications:  
- Overrides potential conflicts of laws rules that might otherwise apply.  
- Does **not** automatically assign jurisdiction to English courts (unless paired with an exclusive jurisdiction clause).  
- Excludes the laws of other UK nations (e.g., Scotland or Northern Ireland).

England Governing Law,fdf90f378b,This Amendment and and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England.,"The clause you provided is a **Governing Law** clause, which directly addresses your query about **""England Governing Law""**. Here’s how it is relevant:

1. **Specifies Applicable Law**:  
   The clause explicitly states that the **laws of England** will govern:  
   - The Amendment (i.e., the contractual changes being made),  
   - Any disputes or claims arising from the Amendment (including non-contractual claims, such as tort or unjust enrichment),  
   - The subject matter of the Amendment, and  
   - The formation of the Amendment.  

2. **Scope of Coverage**:  
   - It applies not only to contractual disputes but also to **non-contractual disputes**, ensuring comprehensive coverage under English law.  
   - It covers **interpretation (construction)** of the Amendment, meaning English legal principles will determine how the clause is understood.  

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - If the query relates to **which jurisdiction’s laws apply** to the contract or disputes, this clause confirms it is **England**.  
   - It ensures predictability, as parties know that English courts (or arbitrators) will apply English law when resolving disputes.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Enforceability**: English courts will uphold this choice of law unless there are strong public policy reasons not to.  
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Prevents uncertainty by preventing disputes over which country’s laws apply.  

This clause is standard in contracts involving English law to provide clarity and legal certainty. Would you like any additional details on how this interacts with jurisdiction clauses or Brexit implications?",5
England Governing Law,3cab4c15d9,"This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales, and all actions brought hereunder whether at law or in equity shall be brought in England.","The clause you provided is directly responsive to the query about **""England Governing Law""** as it explicitly specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of **England and Wales**. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Governing Law**:  
   - The clause states that the agreement is subject to the laws of **England and Wales**, meaning any interpretation, validity, or enforcement of the contract will be determined under English legal principles (including statutes and common law).  
   - This ensures predictability and consistency, as parties agree to a well-established legal framework.

2. **Jurisdiction**:  
   - The clause further mandates that **all legal actions** (whether based on statutory rights or equitable claims) must be brought **in England**.  
   - This prevents parties from litigating disputes in other jurisdictions, reducing uncertainty and potential conflicts over forum selection.

3. **Key Implications**:  
   - **Choice of Law**: English law will apply, even if the parties or contract performance involve other countries.  
   - **Exclusive Jurisdiction**: Courts in England will have sole authority over disputes, streamlining enforcement.  
   - **Legal Certainty**: Aligns with the query’s focus by clearly designating England as the legal anchor for the agreement.

In summary, the clause addresses the query by definitively selecting **England and Wales** as the governing law and jurisdiction, ensuring disputes are resolved under English legal standards and courts. This is critical for contractual clarity and enforceability.",5
England Governing Law,6a8b24fc6b,This Agreement is governed by English law.,"The clause **""This Agreement is governed by English law.""** is directly responsive to the query about **""England Governing Law""** because it explicitly specifies that the agreement in question will be interpreted, enforced, and governed by the laws of England. Here’s why this is relevant:

1. **Legal Framework**: The clause confirms that English law (not the law of another jurisdiction) will apply to the contract. This includes statutory laws, common law principles, and judicial precedents from England.

2. **Dispute Resolution**: If a dispute arises under the agreement, English courts (or arbitral tribunals applying English law) will use English legal principles to resolve it. This provides predictability for the parties.

3. **Interpretation**: Terms in the contract will be construed according to English legal definitions and doctrines, avoiding ambiguity that might arise from conflicting laws in other jurisdictions.

4. **Enforceability**: The clause ensures that the agreement aligns with English legal requirements, which may affect its validity (e.g., compliance with the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 or other English statutes).

5. **Jurisdictional Clarity**: While this clause addresses *which law* governs, it often works alongside a jurisdiction clause (e.g., ""The courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction""), though the latter is not included here.

### Key Implication:  
By selecting English law, the parties agree to exclude the application of foreign laws, even if one or both parties are based outside England. This is common in international contracts where parties prefer the well-established English legal system.

Clause with multiple governing laws,05ef7e7d77,"This Agreement and any and all matters arising directly or indirectly herefrom shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the [***] applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely in such state, including its statutes of limitation but without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.","The query asks about a **""Clause with multiple governing laws,""** but the provided clause actually specifies a **single governing law framework** (the internal laws of a designated state). Here’s how the clause is relevant to the query and why it does *not* involve multiple governing laws:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Single Governing Law**:  
   - The clause designates **one jurisdiction's laws** (the laws of ""[***]"") to govern the agreement. It does not reference multiple legal systems.  
   - The phrase *""internal laws of [***] applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely in such state""* reinforces a unified legal framework.

2. **Exclusion of Conflict of Laws**:  
   - The clause explicitly **rejects conflict-of-law principles** (e.g., rules that might apply foreign laws under certain circumstances). This ensures consistency by avoiding potential splits in governing law.

3. **Scope of Application**:  
   - It covers the agreement itself **and all matters arising directly or indirectly** from it (e.g., disputes, enforcement), all tied to the chosen state’s laws.  

### Why It’s Not ""Multiple Governing Laws"":
- The clause avoids ambiguity by **excluding conflict-of-law rules**, which could otherwise introduce elements of other jurisdictions.  
- If the query expected a clause with *multiple* governing laws (e.g., different laws for different sections of the contract), this example does not reflect that. Such clauses are rare and typically address specific issues (e.g., IP laws of one country, general contract laws of another).

### Relevance to the Query:
If the user mistakenly assumed this clause involves multiple laws, the explanation clarifies that it **unifies the legal framework under one jurisdiction**. If the query intended to ask about clauses that *do* split governing laws, this example would not fit, and a redraft would be needed (e.g., specifying different laws for distinct obligations).  

Would you like assistance drafting a clause that *explicitly* incorporates multiple governing laws?",2
Clause with multiple governing laws,92b8288812,"The laws of the State of New York (excluding any laws that direct the application of another jurisdiction's law) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.","The query asks about a **""Clause with multiple governing laws,""** but the provided clause actually specifies a **single governing law** (New York law) while explicitly excluding any conflicts-of-law rules that might otherwise point to another jurisdiction's law. Here’s how the clause is relevant to the query:

### Key Points:
1. **Single Governing Law**:  
   The clause designates **only New York law** as the applicable law for all matters related to the agreement (validity, interpretation, enforcement, etc.). It does not introduce multiple governing laws.

2. **Exclusion of Conflicts-of-Law Rules**:  
   The parenthetical phrase **""(excluding any laws that direct the application of another jurisdiction's law)""** ensures that New York's *conflict-of-law principles* (which might otherwise refer to another state's or country's laws) are disregarded. This reinforces the exclusivity of New York law.

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - If the query expects a clause with *multiple* governing laws (e.g., one law for disputes and another for contract validity), this clause does **not** meet that expectation.  
   - However, if the query is about how a clause *addresses potential conflicts* between governing laws, this clause is a strong example of **avoiding** multiple laws by explicitly excluding conflicts-of-law rules.  

### Why This Matters:
- **Certainty**: Parties avoid ambiguity by ensuring only one jurisdiction’s laws apply.  
- **Enforceability**: Courts generally respect such clauses unless the chosen law has no reasonable connection to the agreement or violates public policy.  

If the query intended to discuss clauses where *multiple laws* apply (e.g., split clauses for different issues), this example does the opposite—it *unifies* the governing law under one jurisdiction.",2
Clause with multiple governing laws,135342ef61,"This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its principles regarding conflicts of law. This Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to its conflicts of laws principles or the conflicts of laws principles of any other jurisdiction, and each of the parties hereto expressly attorns to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about a ""Clause with multiple governing laws"" because it demonstrates a common drafting approach where a contract (here, a Warrant) specifies a single governing law (New York) but repeats the choice-of-law rule in slightly different wording for emphasis and clarity. 

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Single Governing Law**: Despite the repetition, the clause consistently designates **New York law** as the governing law for both interpretation and enforcement of the Warrant. There is no actual conflict or multiplicity of governing laws—just redundant phrasing to reinforce the parties' intent.

2. **Avoidance of Conflicts of Law**: The clause explicitly rejects the application of conflicts of law principles (both New York's and those of other jurisdictions). This ensures that only New York's **substantive laws** (not its rules for resolving conflicts between different legal systems) will apply.

3. **Jurisdictional Attornment**: The parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, which complements the governing law provision by ensuring disputes are resolved in a forum aligned with the chosen law.

### Why It Matters for the Query:
- The clause might appear to ""repeat"" governing law references, but it serves to eliminate ambiguity by reinforcing the same legal framework throughout.  
- It addresses potential confusion by clarifying that **no other jurisdiction's laws** (including their conflicts rules) will apply.  
- This drafting style is common in contracts to prevent disputes over interpretation and ensure enforceability.  

**Conclusion**: The clause is a single, cohesive governing law provision—not multiple conflicting ones. The repetition is stylistic, not substantive, and underscores the parties' intent to bind themselves exclusively to New York law.",5
Clause with multiple governing laws,f3887246bf,"The laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.","The query asks about a **""Clause with multiple governing laws,""** but the provided clause specifies only **one governing law**—the laws of the State of New York. Here’s how the clause is relevant (or not) to the query:  

### **Key Points of the Clause:**  
1. **Single Governing Law** – The clause explicitly states that **only New York law** applies, excluding conflicts of law principles (which might otherwise introduce multiple jurisdictions).  
2. **Broad Scope** – It covers all aspects of the agreement (validity, interpretation, enforcement, etc.), ensuring consistency under one legal framework.  
3. **Exclusion of Conflicts of Law** – By rejecting conflicts of law principles, the clause prevents courts from applying laws of another jurisdiction even if a dispute has connections elsewhere.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
- If the query expects a clause with **multiple governing laws**, this example does **not** fit, as it enforces a **single jurisdiction**.  
- However, if the query is about **how governing law clauses are structured**, this clause demonstrates a **strong, exclusive choice of law**, avoiding ambiguity.  

### **Possible Interpretation of the Query:**  
If the user meant to ask about **how a clause handles multiple legal systems**, this example shows a way to **prevent** that by strictly selecting one law and excluding conflicts.  

Would you like an example of a clause that **does** involve multiple governing laws (e.g., split by issue or jurisdiction)?",2
Clause with multiple governing laws,29d5d669bf,"THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED ACCORDING TO AND GOVERNED BY THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, EXCLUDING ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD LEAD TO THE APPLICATION OF A SUBSTANTIVE LAW OTHER THAN THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.","This clause is relevant to the query about ""multiple governing laws"" because it explicitly addresses the potential complexity of determining which jurisdiction's laws apply to the agreement. Here’s how it breaks down:

1. **Primary Governing Law**: The clause designates Delaware substantive law as the primary governing law for the agreement, including the rights and obligations of the parties. This ensures consistency and predictability in interpreting the contract.

2. **Exclusion of Conflicts of Laws Principles**: The clause goes further to exclude Delaware's *conflicts of laws* principles (also known as *choice-of-law rules*), which might otherwise direct a court to apply the laws of another jurisdiction (e.g., if the dispute has stronger ties to another state). This exclusion reinforces that Delaware law applies *exclusively*, even if another jurisdiction's laws might seem relevant under general conflicts analysis.

3. **Purpose**: By excluding conflicts principles, the clause avoids ambiguity or the risk of ""multiple governing laws"" being applied to different aspects of the agreement. It ensures that Delaware law governs all substantive issues, regardless of where a dispute is litigated or other connecting factors (e.g., parties' locations or performance of the contract).

### Relevance to the Query:
The clause demonstrates a common technique to *prevent* multiple governing laws from applying. While the query mentions ""multiple governing laws,"" this clause is structured to *avoid* that scenario by:  
- Selecting a single jurisdiction's substantive law (Delaware).  
- Explicitly rejecting any conflicts rules that might introduce another jurisdiction's laws.  

This approach provides clarity and reduces legal uncertainty, which is often the intent behind such clauses. If the query sought an example of *actual* multiple governing laws (e.g., splitting jurisdiction by issue), this clause would not fit, as it consolidates governance under one law. However, it directly addresses the *potential* for multiple laws to arise and resolves it definitively.  

Would you like an example of a clause where multiple governing laws *are* intentionally applied to different parts of an agreement?",5
Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks,6dd55572fe,This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflict or choice of law principles.,"The clause you provided specifies that the agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California **without reference to conflict of law principles** (which could otherwise pull in laws from other jurisdictions). However, it does **not explicitly exclude** the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or other similar regulatory frameworks (e.g., the CISG for international contracts).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Governing Law Selection**:  
   - The clause designates California state law as the governing law, which **includes** the California Commercial Code (the state's adoption of the UCC) unless expressly excluded.  
   - If the intent is to **exclude the UCC**, the clause should explicitly state so (e.g., *""excluding the Uniform Commercial Code""* or *""excluding any statutory or regulatory frameworks governing commercial transactions""*).  

2. **Conflict of Law Waiver**:  
   - The phrase *""without giving effect to conflict or choice of law principles""* ensures that **only California law** applies, preventing courts from applying another jurisdiction’s laws (which might include the UCC or other frameworks if the dispute involves interstate commerce).  
   - However, this does not inherently exclude the UCC, as the UCC is **part of California’s statutory law**.  

3. **Implications for the Query**:  
   - If the goal is to **avoid the UCC** (e.g., in a services agreement or intellectual property contract where the UCC’s sale-of-goods rules are irrelevant), the clause should be revised to explicitly exclude it.  
   - Example of an amended clause:  
     *""This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of law principles and the Uniform Commercial Code.""*  

### Key Takeaway:  
The current clause does **not** satisfy the query’s request to exclude the UCC or similar frameworks. To achieve that, an express exclusion must be added.",4
Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks,c2714a9a64,"This Agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions enforced in accordance with, the laws of California without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.","The clause you provided specifies that the agreement will be governed by the laws of California, **excluding its principles of conflicts of laws**. This is relevant to the query in the following ways:

1. **Exclusion of the UCC or Similar Frameworks**  
   - The **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)** is a standardized set of laws governing commercial transactions in the U.S.  
   - By stating that California law applies **without regard to conflicts of laws principles**, the clause ensures that only California's **internal substantive laws** (not necessarily the UCC or other states' laws) will govern the agreement.  
   - If the parties intend to **exclude the UCC**, they may need to explicitly state so, as the UCC is part of California law unless contractually displaced (per UCC § 1-302).  

2. **Avoiding Conflicts of Laws Complications**  
   - The **""without regard to conflicts of laws""** language prevents a court from applying another jurisdiction’s laws (which might include the UCC or other regulatory frameworks) even if a different state has a stronger connection to the dispute.  

3. **Clarifying Intent to Use Only General Contract Law**  
   - If the parties want to ensure that **only common law contract principles** (not the UCC) apply, they may need to explicitly exclude the UCC, since California has adopted it.  
   - A more precise clause might say:  
     *""This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of California, excluding its conflict of laws principles and the Uniform Commercial Code.""*  

### Conclusion  
The current clause **partially** addresses the query by ensuring California law governs, but it does not **explicitly exclude the UCC**. If the intent is to **fully exclude the UCC or other regulatory frameworks**, the clause should be amended to specify that exclusion.  

Would you like a revised version of the clause to make this exclusion clearer?",4
Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks,27eaf01d0a,"THE INTERPRETATION AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS CONTRACT SHALL BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND CONTROLLED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DOCTRINES GOVERNING CHOICE OF LAW.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query in the following ways:

1. **Governing Law Specification**:  
   The clause explicitly states that the contract shall be interpreted and performed in accordance with the laws of **Texas**, which satisfies the request for a governing law provision.  

2. **Exclusion of UCC and Similar Frameworks**:  
   - The phrase **""without regard to the doctrines governing choice of law""** reinforces that only Texas **substantive law** (not conflict-of-law principles) will apply.  
   - While the clause does not **explicitly** mention the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)** or other regulatory frameworks, Texas law includes both common law contract principles and the UCC (where applicable).  
   - If the parties intend to **exclude the UCC entirely**, they should add language such as:  
     *""excluding the Uniform Commercial Code and any other similar commercial laws or regulations.""*  

3. **Practical Effect**:  
   - As written, the clause ensures that Texas law governs, but if the contract involves a transaction covered by the UCC (e.g., sale of goods), Texas’s version of the UCC may still apply by default.

Here’s how the provided clause is relevant:

### **Key Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Nature of the Agreement**  
   - The clause governs **licensing rights, intellectual property (Proprietary Marks), and franchise relationships**, which are typically outside the scope of the UCC. The UCC primarily applies to the **sale of goods** (Article 2) and, in some cases, licensing (Article 9 for secured transactions), but franchise agreements and IP licensing are generally governed by **common law contract principles** unless explicitly stated otherwise.

2. **No UCC-Specific Language**  
   - The clause does not reference **""goods,"" ""merchantability,"" ""title,"" or other UCC-specific terms**. Instead, it focuses on **perpetual, non-exclusive licensing rights**, which are more aligned with **general contract and intellectual property law** rather than commercial transactions under the UCC.

3. **Franchise & IP Licensing Context**  
   - Franchise agreements often involve **ongoing relationships, branding, and operational control**, which are **not typical UCC-covered transactions**. The UCC does not govern franchise agreements unless they involve the sale of goods (e.g., supply contracts). Here, the focus is on **trademarks, proprietary systems, and franchisor-franchisee obligations**, which are **contractual and IP-based** rather than UCC-based.

4. **Exclusion of UCC by Implication**  
   - Since the clause does not invoke UCC principles (e.g., warranties, perfect tender rule, remedies under Article 2), it suggests that the parties intend for **general contract law** (and possibly state franchise laws) to apply. Courts often treat franchise agreements as **mixed contracts** (services + IP), where the UCC does not automatically govern unless the dispute centers on a goods-related provision.

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause reinforces that the agreement is **not governed by the UCC** because it deals with **licensing, franchising, and intellectual property rights**—areas typically outside UCC coverage. If the governing law clause explicitly **excludes the UCC**, this provision aligns with that intent by focusing on **non-UCC subject matter (IP and franchise operations)**.

Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks,80d287bc4a,"Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query in the following ways:

1. **Explicit Governing Law Selection**:  
   The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of California, USA, **without reference to conflict of law principles**. This means that only California's **statutory and common law** will apply, excluding any default rules that might otherwise incorporate other legal frameworks (such as the UCC).

2. **Exclusion of the UCC or Similar Frameworks**:  
   - The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a default body of law that typically governs commercial transactions in the U.S. unless expressly excluded.  
   - By stating that California law applies **without reference to conflict of law principles**, the clause ensures that no other jurisdiction's laws (including the UCC, if not adopted as part of California law) will influence the interpretation of the agreement.  
   - California has its own commercial code (based partly on the UCC but with modifications), so the clause effectively limits governance to California’s specific statutes and case law, rather than broader UCC principles that might apply in other states.

3. **Avoiding Default Rules**:  
   - Many contracts fall under the UCC by default if they involve the sale of goods. However, this clause ensures that even if the agreement involves UCC-covered transactions, California’s **non-UCC common law and statutory law** will take precedence (unless California’s version of the UCC is explicitly part of its governing law).  
   - If the parties want to **exclude the UCC entirely**, they might need even more explicit language (e.g., ""excluding the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted by California""). However, the current clause strongly leans toward California’s general contract law.

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause aligns with the query by ensuring that only California’s **non-UCC legal framework** governs the agreement, avoiding the application of default commercial rules like the UCC or other states' laws. For absolute clarity, some parties might further specify exclusion of the UCC, but this wording already heavily implies it.",5
Most Favored Nation Clause,47921871a2,"This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.","The **Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause** is a provision in a contract that ensures one party receives terms at least as favorable as those given to any other party in similar agreements. While the clause you provided does not explicitly mention an MFN clause, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### **Relevance to MFN Clauses:**
1. **Governing Law & Enforcement**  
   - The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by **California law**, excluding conflicts of laws and the **UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)**.  
   - If an MFN clause exists elsewhere in the contract, its interpretation and enforceability would be determined under **California law**, which may have specific precedents on how MFN clauses are applied.  
   - The exclusion of the CISG ensures that international sales law does not override domestic contract principles, which could otherwise affect how MFN provisions are construed.

2. **Conflict of Laws Implications**  
   - By excluding **conflict of laws rules**, the parties avoid uncertainty about which jurisdiction’s laws might apply if a dispute arises.  
   - This is important for MFN clauses because different jurisdictions may enforce them differently (e.g., some may require strict reciprocity, while others may allow broader interpretations).

3. **Consistency in Contractual Terms**  
   - If an MFN clause is present, the governing law clause ensures that any disputes over whether a party received ""less favorable"" terms compared to others will be resolved under **California law**, providing predictability.  
   - Courts in California may look at precedents on MFN clauses in commercial contracts to determine fairness and enforceability.

### **Conclusion:**  
While this clause does not directly address an MFN provision, it establishes the **legal framework** under which an MFN clause (if present) would be interpreted and enforced. The choice of California law (and exclusions) ensures that the contract remains under a predictable legal system, which is crucial for clauses like MFN that rely on comparative fairness across agreements.

Most Favored Nation Clause,2eff6f9356,"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.","The **Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause** is a provision in a contract where one party agrees to extend to the other party terms that are at least as favorable as those offered to any other party in similar agreements. 

### Relevance to the Provided Clause:
The clause you provided is a **governing law and construction clause**, which specifies that the agreement is governed by California law (excluding conflict of laws principles and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods). 

While this clause does **not** explicitly contain an MFN provision, its relevance to an MFN clause would depend on how the broader contract is structured:

1. **Interpretation of MFN Terms Under California Law**  
   - If the contract includes an MFN clause, this governing law provision ensures that any disputes over its scope, enforceability, or application will be interpreted under California law.  
   - California courts may have specific precedents on how MFN clauses are enforced (e.g., whether they apply retroactively, how ""favored terms"" are defined).

2. **Exclusion of Conflicting Doctrines**  
   - By excluding conflict of laws rules, the parties avoid uncertainty about whether another jurisdiction’s laws might influence the MFN clause’s interpretation.  
   - The exclusion of the UN CISG ensures that international sales law does not override California’s approach to contractual fairness in MFN disputes.

3. **Potential Interaction with MFN Obligations**  
   - If the MFN clause requires parity in pricing, licensing, or other terms, California law will determine whether the clause is enforceable (e.g., under doctrines of unconscionability or good faith).  
   - California’s legal framework may also affect how ""favored"" terms are compared across different agreements.

### Key Takeaway:  
The governing law clause does **not** create an MFN obligation, but it establishes the legal framework for interpreting and enforcing one if it exists elsewhere in the contract. For a complete analysis, the actual MFN clause (if present) should be reviewed alongside this provision.

Most Favored Nation Clause,829065c4f5,"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to its conflict or choice of law rules or principles. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.","The **Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause** is a provision in a contract that ensures one party receives terms at least as favorable as those given to any other party in similar agreements. While the provided clause does not explicitly mention an MFN clause, its relevance to the query lies in the **governing law and conflict of laws provisions**, which could indirectly interact with an MFN clause in the following ways:

### 1. **Governing Law Implications for MFN Enforcement**  
   - The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by **New York law** and alternatively by **California law**, excluding conflict of laws rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  
   - If an MFN clause exists elsewhere in the contract, its interpretation and enforceability would depend on the chosen governing law (New York or California).  
   - Courts in these states may interpret MFN clauses differently (e.g., scope, applicability to pricing, licensing, or other terms).

### 2. **Conflict of Laws Exclusion**  
   - By excluding conflict of laws principles, the parties aim to avoid disputes over which jurisdiction’s laws should apply if an MFN clause is contested.  
   - This could prevent a party from arguing that another state’s or country’s laws (which might limit MFN enforceability) should apply.

### 3. **Exclusion of the UN Convention (CISG)**  
   - The exclusion of the **CISG** ensures that international sale-of-goods rules do not override the MFN clause (if the contract involves cross-border transactions).  
   - This reinforces that only domestic U.S. state law (NY/CA) governs, providing predictability for MFN-related disputes.

### Key Takeaway:  
While this clause does not contain an MFN provision, it **establishes the legal framework** under which an MFN clause (if present elsewhere in the agreement) would be interpreted and enforced. The choice of law and exclusion of conflicts principles could prevent jurisdictional challenges that might weaken an MFN clause’s effect.

While the clause you provided does not explicitly mention an MFN clause, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### **Relevance to MFN Clauses:**
1. **Jurisdiction and Enforcement**  
   - If an MFN clause exists elsewhere in the agreement, this **venue and governing law clause** ensures that any disputes related to the MFN provision (e.g., claims that a party received better terms from a third party) will be resolved in **North Carolina courts under North Carolina law**.  
   - This prevents forum shopping and ensures consistency in legal interpretation.

2. **Choice of Law Impact on MFN Interpretation**  
   - Since the clause excludes **choice-of-law and arbitration provisions**, any dispute over whether an MFN clause was violated will be decided strictly under **North Carolina law**, not another jurisdiction’s laws that might interpret MFN clauses differently.  
   - This could be crucial if the MFN clause is ambiguous—North Carolina contract law would govern its enforceability.

3. **Uniformity in Dispute Resolution**  
   - If the agreement includes an MFN clause, this provision ensures that all disputes (including those over MFN treatment) are handled in a **single jurisdiction**, preventing conflicting rulings from different courts.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
While this clause does not **contain** an MFN provision, it **supports** the enforceability of an MFN clause (if present) by:  
- Mandating a **consistent legal framework** (North Carolina law).  
- Preventing disputes from being litigated in multiple jurisdictions.  
- Ensuring that any claims of preferential treatment under an MFN clause are resolved under a predictable legal standard.

While the clause you provided does **not** explicitly contain an MFN clause, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### **Relevance to MFN Considerations:**
1. **Governing Law & Jurisdiction**  
   - The clause specifies that disputes will be resolved under **British Columbia law** and in its courts.  
   - If an MFN clause exists elsewhere in the agreement, this governing law provision could impact how the MFN clause is interpreted and enforced.  
   - Courts in British Columbia would apply local legal principles to determine whether an MFN obligation has been breached.

2. **Non-Exclusive Jurisdiction**  
   - The **non-exclusive** jurisdiction clause means parties can still sue in other courts if permitted by law.  
   - If an MFN clause requires equal treatment across agreements, the choice of jurisdiction could be compared to other contracts to ensure no party is disadvantaged.

3. **Interpretation & Enforcement**  
   - Since the agreement is governed by British Columbia law, any MFN clause would be construed under its legal framework.  
   - Courts would assess whether the MFN obligation was honored based on local contract law principles.

### **Conclusion:**  
While this clause does **not** contain an MFN provision, it establishes the legal framework (British Columbia law) that would govern how an MFN clause (if present elsewhere in the contract) is interpreted and enforced. If the agreement includes an MFN clause, this governing law provision ensures consistency in how disputes over preferential treatment are resolved.

Renewal clause that requires notice to Renew,ee70d57af2,"This Agreement will automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a ""Renewal Term""), unless either Party notifies the other at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable, of its intention not to renew this Agreement (a ""Termination Notice"").","The **renewal clause** you provided directly addresses the **query** about a clause that requires notice to renew. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

1. **Automatic Renewal with Notice Requirement**:  
   The clause states that the agreement will **automatically renew** for successive one-year terms (Renewal Terms) **unless** either party provides a **Termination Notice** at least **30 days before** the end of the current term.  
   - This means renewal is the default unless **active notice** is given to prevent it.  

2. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - The query asks for a clause that **requires notice to renew**—this clause fits because it **mandates advance notice (30 days) to stop renewal**.  
   - If no notice is given, renewal happens automatically.  

3. **Key Elements**:  
   - **Trigger for Non-Renewal**: A party must send a Termination Notice.  
   - **Timing Requirement**: Notice must be given **at least 30 days before** the term expires.  
   - **Effect of No Notice**: The agreement continues for another year.  

### Summary:  
This clause ensures that renewal is **not passive**—it **requires proactive communication (notice)** to terminate or prevent automatic renewal. If neither party acts, the contract renews by default. This protects both parties from unintended lapses or extensions.

1. **Automatic Renewal**:  
   The agreement will renew automatically for successive one-month periods unless action is taken to stop it. This means no positive notice is required to renew—only inaction is needed for continuation.

2. **Notice Requirement to Prevent Renewal**:  
   If either party (Customer or i-on) wants to **avoid renewal**, they must actively notify the other party of their intent **not to renew**. This notice must be given at least **15 days before** the end of the current term (initial or renewal period).

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - The clause satisfies the requirement for a ""notice to renew"" structure, but with a twist: it mandates notice **only to terminate** the renewal process, not to initiate it.  
   - It ensures clarity on timing (15-day advance notice) and parties' obligations to communicate non-renewal intentions.  

In summary, the clause aligns with the query by establishing a conditional renewal mechanism where **notice is compulsory to halt automatic renewal**, rather than to enable it. This shifts the burden to the parties to act if they wish to terminate the agreement at the end of a term.",4
Renewal clause that requires notice to Renew,8463d5d208,"This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the<omitted>Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.","The query asks about a **renewal clause that requires notice to renew**. The provided clause is a **non-renewal notice clause**, which is closely related but operates inversely to a typical renewal notice requirement. Here’s the relevance:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Automatic Renewal**:  
   The agreement renews automatically for successive one-month periods unless action is taken. This means no affirmative notice is required **to renew**—it happens by default.

2. **Notice Requirement for Non-Renewal**:  
   To **prevent renewal**, either party must give written notice (of intent not to renew) at least **15 days before the current term ends**. This is a **termination condition** rather than a renewal condition.

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - The clause does **not** require notice **to renew** (since renewal is automatic).  
   - Instead, it requires notice **to stop renewal**.  
   - This is a common alternative to a ""positive"" renewal clause (where parties must actively opt-in to renew).  

### Why It Matters:  
- The clause ensures continuity of the agreement unless either party acts to terminate it.  
- It shifts the burden to the parties to **communicate non-renewal** rather than renewal.  
- The 15-day notice period provides a buffer to avoid unintended renewals.  

If the query sought a clause where renewal is **not automatic** (i.e., requiring affirmative notice **to renew**), this clause would not fit. However, it answers the broader intent by clarifying how renewal operates and when notice is mandatory (to terminate, not to continue).

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### **Key Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Automatic Renewal with Notice Requirement**  
   - The agreement will **automatically renew** for successive 3-year terms unless one party takes action to stop it.  
   - To **prevent renewal**, a party must give **written notice of non-renewal** at least **90 days before** the end of the current term (Initial Term or Renewal Term).  

2. **Notice Obligation for Non-Renewal**  
   - The clause explicitly **requires advance notice** (90 days) if a party does **not** want the agreement to renew.  
   - This ensures that renewal is not passive; a party must **actively opt out** to terminate the agreement at the end of a term.  

3. **Alternative Termination**  
   - The clause also clarifies that the agreement can be **terminated earlier** under **Article 11** (likely covering breach, mutual agreement, or other termination rights).  

### **Why This Answers the Query:**  
- The query asked for a **renewal clause requiring notice**, and this clause **fits precisely** by:  
  - Making renewal **automatic** unless notice is given.  
  - **Mandating written notice** (90 days prior) to avoid renewal.  
  - Structuring the renewal process clearly for both parties.  

This ensures that the agreement continues unless a party **affirmatively acts** to stop renewal by providing timely notice.

1. **Auto-Renewal Mechanism** - The clause states that the agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms (Renewal Terms) unless action is taken to stop it. This confirms the auto-renewal feature mentioned in the query.

2. **Notice Requirement** - It specifies that either party must provide a ""Termination Notice"" at least **30 days before** the end of the current term (Initial Term or Renewal Term) to prevent automatic renewal. This satisfies the query's focus on notice requirements for termination.

1. **Auto-Renewal Mechanism**:

Clause that requires notice to terminate auto-renew,38d6b61e69,"This agreement shall terminate:
a. Automatically if any public authority cancels or declines to renew the Agency's license or Certificate of Authority.
b. Immediately if either party gives detailed written notice to the other of alleged gross and willful misconduct, fraud or material misrepresentation.","The query asks for a **clause that requires notice to terminate an auto-renewing agreement**. However, the provided clause does **not** address auto-renewal or termination notices for routine contract expiration. Instead, it covers two specific termination scenarios:  

1. **Automatic termination** if a regulatory authority cancels or refuses to renew the Agency's license (no notice required).  
2. **Immediate termination for cause** (e.g., fraud or misconduct), which requires **written notice** but only in cases of material breach.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause **does not** govern standard termination of an auto-renewing agreement. It only applies to exceptional circumstances (regulatory action or misconduct).  
- While it mentions **written notice**, this is tied to allegations of wrongdoing, not routine termination before renewal.  

### Suggested Improvement:  
To address auto-renewal, the clause should explicitly state:  
- The agreement renews automatically unless either party provides **advance written notice** (e.g., 30/60/90 days) before the renewal date.  
- Example: *""This agreement shall auto-renew for successive [term lengths] unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least [X] days prior to the end of the current term.""*  

Let me know if you'd like help drafting such a provision.",2
Clause that requires notice to terminate auto-renew,6352d8c837,"This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive three (3) year terms thereafter (each a ""Renewal Term"" and together with the Initial Term, the ""Term"") until and unless (i) either Party provides the other Party written notice of non-renewal no later than ninety (90) days prior the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term or (ii) earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11.","This clause directly addresses the query by specifying the **notice requirement to terminate an auto-renewal provision** in the agreement. Here’s the breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Auto-Renewal Mechanism**:  
   The agreement automatically renews for successive 3-year terms unless action is taken to stop it. This creates a continuous contractual relationship unless terminated properly.

2. **Notice Requirement**:  
   To prevent auto-renewal, **written notice of non-renewal** must be provided by either party:  
   - **Timing**: At least **90 days before** the end of the current term (Initial Term or any Renewal Term).  
   - **Form**: The notice must be in writing (email or letter, unless specified otherwise).  

3. **Alternative Termination**:  
   The clause also references termination rights under **Article 11** (e.g., breach, mutual agreement), but the auto-renewal can **only** be stopped by adhering to the 90-day notice rule.  

### Key Takeaway for the Query:  
This clause ensures that parties cannot allow the agreement to auto-renew unintentionally—they must **actively opt out** by giving timely written notice. Failure to meet the 90-day deadline means the contract renews for another 3-year term.

Termination for Convenience,8a8d5a3c28,"Both Parties agree that during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following the termination, both Parties will not (i) solicit, encourage, or take any other action, which is intended, directly or indirectly, to induce any employee to terminate his or her employment with a Party; or (ii) interfere in any manner with the contractual or employment relationship between the Parties and any their employees.","The clause you provided is a **non-solicitation** provision, which restricts both parties from poaching each other's employees during the term of the agreement and for two years after termination. While it does not directly address **""Termination for Convenience""** (which typically allows one or both parties to terminate the agreement without cause), it is relevant in the following ways:  

### **Relevance to Termination for Convenience:**  
1. **Post-Termination Obligations** – Even if the agreement is terminated for convenience, this clause remains enforceable for the specified two-year period, ensuring that neither party can solicit or hire the other’s employees after termination.  
2. **Protection of Business Interests** – The clause safeguards both parties from losing key employees due to solicitation, which could be a concern if the termination for convenience leads to a competitive or adversarial relationship.  
3. **Continuity of Restrictions** – Unlike some clauses that lapse upon termination, this one survives, meaning compliance is required regardless of how or why the agreement ends.  

### **Key Consideration:**  
If the agreement includes a **Termination for Convenience** clause, the non-solicitation provision ensures that the departing party cannot immediately recruit employees from the other side, maintaining stability post-termination.  

Would you like suggestions on how to align this clause more explicitly with termination for convenience (e.g., carve-outs, notice periods, or exceptions)?",4
Termination for Convenience,431ff9409a,"Upon termination of this Agreement by Customer in whole or in part or upon the termination of any Facility Addendum, in each case, pursuant to Section 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 or 7.6, and on a terminated-Product-by-terminated-Product basis, at Customer's option and pursuant to Customer's instructions, Manufacturer shall provide Customer with sufficient inventory of such terminated Product to ensure business continuity according to then-current terms and pricing (subject to Section 3) until the earlier of: (i) Customer's identification of, and securing of Regulatory Approval for, another supplier of such terminated Product or (ii) unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum as the ""Inventory Tail Period"" for such Product, a time period that reflects Customer's reasonable needs of such Product as mutually agreed upon by the Parties in good faith.

In the event of the termination of this Agreement by Customer in accordance with Section 7.7 or the termination of this Agreement by Manufacturer in accordance with Section 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 or 7.6, Customer shall purchase at cost all Product Materials purchased in accordance with Customer's Purchase Orders and on reasonable reliance upon Customer's Forecast; provided that Manufacturer uses its reasonable commercial efforts to exhaust existing stocks of such Product Materials prior to the date of<omitted>termination. In the event that Manufacturer or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, sells, assigns, leases, conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of any Facility (a ""Facility Disposition""), then Manufacturer shall immediately notify Customer of such event and Customer shall be entitled for a period of six (6) months after the receipt of such notice to terminate any Facility Addendum with respect to such Facility for cause immediately upon written notice to Manufacturer and, in the event Customer decides not to terminate the Facility Addendum for cause, Customer shall be entitled for a period of two (2) years (or such longer period in order to obtain approval for manufacture from all applicable Governmental Authorities) after<omitted>receipt of such notice to receive Technical Support at Manufacturer's sole cost to enable Customer to orderly transfer production of affected Product or Products to a Customer facility or an alternative facility as designated by Customer; provided that Manufacturer shall notify Customer of any proposed or planned Facility Disposition by Manufacturer or any of its Affiliates as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event no later than the date that is three (3) months prior to the effective date of such Facility Disposition. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement in whole or in part or any Facility Addendum, if requested by Customer within ninety (90) days immediately following the effective date of such expiration or termination of this Agreement and pursuant to Customer's reasonable request and instructions, Manufacturer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, as applicable, make assignments or partial assignments of such material contracts, licenses, permits, and other material documents, as applicable, in each case subject to any restrictions on assignment, or as may otherwise be set forth in any Contract relating thereto.","This clause is highly relevant to the query on **""Termination for Convenience""** as it outlines the rights, obligations, and procedures governing termination by the **Customer** (not the Manufacturer) under specific sections of the agreement (Sections 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, or 7.6). Here’s a breakdown of its key aspects:

### **1. Business Continuity Post-Termination**  
- If the Customer terminates the agreement (in whole or in part), the **Manufacturer must supply sufficient inventory** of the terminated product(s) to ensure business continuity.  
- The supply period lasts until the earlier of:  
  - (i) Customer finding a new supplier + securing regulatory approval, or  
  (ii) an agreed-upon ""Inventory Tail Period"" (if not predefined in a Facility Addendum).  

### **2. Purchase of Work-in-Progress & Materials**  
- The Customer has **90 days post-termination** to buy any:  
  - **Work-in-process (WIP)**  
  - **Product Materials** (purchased exclusively for the Customer).  
- If the termination is under **Section 7.7 (Termination for Convenience by Customer)** or by Manufacturer under **Sections 7.3-7.6**, the Customer must **buy all Product Materials** ordered based on its forecasts (at cost).  

### **3. Disposal of Quarantined Products**  
- Quarantined products must be **disposed of/destroyed per Customer’s instructions** (at Customer’s cost).  
- **Exception:** If quarantine is due to Manufacturer’s **gross negligence, fraud, or breach**, or if termination is under **Sections 7.3-7.6**, the **Manufacturer bears the disposal costs**.  

### **4. Technical & Regulatory Support for Transition**  
- The Manufacturer must provide **reasonable technical support** (e.g., training, troubleshooting, transfer assistance) to help the Customer transition production to a new facility.  
- If the Manufacturer sells/disposes of a Facility (**""Facility Disposition""**), the Customer has:  
  - **6 months** to terminate the related Facility Addendum **for cause**, or  
  - **2 years (or longer for regulatory approval)** to receive **free technical support** for transferring production.  

### **5. Assignment of Contracts/Licenses**  
- Upon termination, the Manufacturer must **assign relevant contracts/licenses** (if requested by Customer within 90 days), subject to legal restrictions.  

### **Relevance to ""Termination for Convenience""**  
- While this clause does not explicitly label termination under **Section 7.7** as ""for convenience,"" it governs **Customer-initiated termination** (including convenience-based exits).  
- It ensures:  
  - **Continuity of supply** post-termination.  
  - **Recovery of materials/WIP** to minimize waste.  
  - **Smooth transition** (via technical support and contract assignments).  
  - **Cost allocation** (who pays for disposal, materials, etc.).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause **protects the Customer’s operational needs** when terminating the agreement, ensuring minimal disruption while balancing obligations (e.g., purchasing materials, covering disposal costs). If **Section 7.7** is the ""Termination for Convenience"" clause, this section complements it by detailing post-termination logistics.

Here’s how it relates to the query:  

### Key Relevance to Termination for Convenience:  
1. **Inventory Continuity**  
   - The Manufacturer must supply sufficient inventory of terminated Products to ensure business continuity for the Customer until:  
     - The Customer secures a new supplier (with Regulatory Approval), **or**  
     - An agreed-upon ""Inventory Tail Period"" expires.  
   - Pricing remains consistent with current terms (subject to Section 3).  

2. **Purchase of Work-in-Progress/Materials**  
   - The Customer has **90 days post-termination** to buy any:  
     - Work-in-process or Product Materials exclusively procured for the Customer.  
   - If termination is under Section 7.7 (or by Manufacturer under 7.3–7.6), the Customer must purchase all Product Materials at cost (provided Manufacturer tried to use existing stocks).  

3. **Disposal of Quarantined Products**  
   - Quarantined Products are disposed of at the Customer’s cost **unless**:  
     - The quarantine resulted from the Manufacturer’s gross negligence, fraud, or breach, **or**  
     - Termination was initiated by the Customer under Sections 7.3–7.6 (in which case Manufacturer bears disposal costs).  

4. **Technical Support & Transition Assistance**  
   - The Manufacturer must cooperate to provide **reasonable technical support** (e.g., training, troubleshooting, transfer assistance) during the transition to a new supplier or facility.  
   - If a Facility is sold/transferred (""Facility Disposition""), the Customer may:  
     - Terminate the related Facility Addendum **for cause** within 6 months, **or**  
     - Receive **2 years of free Technical Support** from Manufacturer to facilitate production transfer.  

5. **Assignment of Contracts/Licenses**  
   - Upon request (within 90 days post-termination), the Manufacturer must use **commercially reasonable efforts** to assign relevant contracts/licenses to the Customer (where permissible).  

### Why This Matters for Termination for Convenience:  
- **Flexibility for Customer**: The clause allows the Customer to terminate without cause (under Sections 7.3–7.6) while ensuring minimal disruption via inventory support, material buyouts, and transition assistance.  
- **Cost Allocation**: Specifies who bears costs (e.g., disposal, materials) based on termination context (e.g., fault vs. convenience).  
- **Supplier Transition**: Facilitates a smooth handover through technical support and contract assignments, critical for regulatory/compliance continuity.  

In summary, this clause operationalizes ""Termination for Convenience"" by balancing the Customer’s need for flexibility with structured obligations to protect both parties’ interests during transition.",5
Termination for Convenience,0323b9143c,"Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, upon 30 days' prior written notice of such termination; provided, (a) that, with respect to the Services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A, unless otherwise indicated therein, those Services may not be terminated independently except in accordance with an agreed Migration Plan and, (b) any unamortized costs associated with Provider's purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will be passed through to the Terminating Party.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **""Termination for Convenience""** as it outlines the conditions under which either party (Company or RGHI) can terminate certain services without cause (i.e., for convenience). Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Right to Terminate for Convenience**:  
   - The clause allows **Company** to terminate any **Transition Service** and **RGHI** to terminate any **Reverse Transition Service** with **30 days' prior written notice**, unless otherwise agreed or stated in the Exhibits.  
   - This means either party can end these services without needing to prove a breach or fault, as long as they follow the notice requirement.

2. **Exceptions to Termination Rights**:  
   - **Section G1 of Exhibit A**: Services listed here cannot be terminated independently unless done in accordance with an agreed **Migration Plan**. This protects critical services from abrupt termination.  
   - **Unamortized Costs**: If the Provider (the party providing the service) incurred specific costs (e.g., licenses) to deliver the services, the Terminating Party must reimburse these costs. This ensures fairness by preventing financial harm to the Provider due to early termination.

3. **Key Implications for the Query**:  
   - The clause balances flexibility (allowing termination for convenience) with safeguards (protecting against arbitrary termination of essential services and ensuring cost recovery).  
   - It clarifies that termination is not absolute—certain services (like those in **Exhibit A, Section G1**) have additional restrictions, and financial obligations may apply.

In summary, this clause answers the query by defining **when, how, and under what conditions** termination for convenience is permitted, while addressing potential financial and operational consequences.",5
Termination for Convenience,494bebe771,"Customer acknowledges that the Termination for Convenience Fee and the Termination for Cause Fee are each a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty. If M&I terminates this Agreement following an Event of Default on the part of Customer, or if Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1 above without complying with the notification requirements set forth in Section 11.1, then Customer shall pay M&I a termination fee (""Termination for Cause Fee"") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value, payable as set forth in Section 11.1 above. Customer may terminate this Agreement during the Term upon at least one (1) years' written notice to M&I, provided that Customer pays M&I an early termination fee (""Termination for Convenience Fee"") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **""Termination for Convenience""** because it outlines the conditions, obligations, and financial consequences associated with terminating the agreement for convenience (i.e., without cause) versus termination for cause. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Elements Related to Termination for Convenience:
1. **Right to Terminate for Convenience**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the **Customer** may terminate the agreement during the term **without cause** (i.e., for convenience) by providing at least **one (1) year's written notice** to M&I.  
   - This addresses the query by confirming the existence of a termination-for-convenience mechanism in the contract.

2. **Termination for Convenience Fee**:  
   - The Customer must pay a fee (the **""Termination for Convenience Fee""**) equal to a **REDACTED percentage of the Estimated Remaining Value**.  
   - This fee is characterized as **liquidated damages** (a pre-agreed reasonable estimate of losses, not a penalty), which protects M&I from unforeseen losses due to early termination.  

3. **Contrast with Termination for Cause**:  
   - The clause distinguishes between termination for convenience and termination for **cause** (e.g., an Event of Default by the Customer).  
   - If M&I terminates due to the Customer’s default, or if the Customer terminates without complying with Section 11.1’s notice requirements, a **""Termination for Cause Fee""** applies (also a percentage of the Estimated Remaining Value).  

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause clarifies:  
  - **How** a party can terminate for convenience (notice period).  
  - **What cost** is incurred (the Convenience Fee).  
  - **Legal intent** (the fee is framed as liquidated damages, reducing dispute risk).  
- It ensures the Customer understands the financial and procedural implications of exercising this right, which is critical for contract planning and risk assessment.  

### Practical Implications:
- The **one-year notice period** allows M&I time to adjust operations or find replacement business.  
- The **fee structure** discourages arbitrary termination while compensating M&I for lost expected revenue.  

In summary, this clause directly answers the query by defining the process, fees, and legal rationale for termination for convenience in the agreement.",5
Non-compete bound by time and territory,1c8a2e7fbf,"you and your Principal Owners must enter into a non-competition agreement wherein you agree not to engage in a competitive business for a period of two (2) years after the Transfer and within twenty-five (25) miles of your Franchise Premises or any other The Joint Corp.

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, you agree not to engage in a competitive business for a period of two (2) years after the termination or expiration and within twenty-five (25) miles of your Franchise Premises or any other The Joint Corp. Location franchise location.","This clause directly addresses the query regarding a **non-compete bound by time and territory** by specifying clear restrictions on competitive activities in terms of **duration** and **geographic scope**. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### **1. Time Bound (Duration)**  
- The non-compete applies **for 2 years** after either:  
  - The **Transfer** of the franchise (if ownership changes), or  
  - The **termination/expiration** of the franchise agreement.  
- This ensures the franchisee and their associates cannot compete immediately after leaving the business, protecting the franchisor’s interests.

### **2. Territory Bound (Geographic Scope)**  
- The restriction applies within a **25-mile radius** of:  
  - The franchisee’s original **Franchise Premises**, or  
  - **Any other The Joint Corp. Location franchise**.  
- This prevents the franchisee from opening or working for a competing business in proximity to existing franchise locations, safeguarding the franchisor’s market.

### **3. Scope of Restricted Activities**  
The clause broadly defines competition by prohibiting:  
- Direct or indirect ownership, investment, employment, or consulting roles in similar businesses.  
- Involvement by **Principal Owners** and **immediate family members**, extending the restriction beyond just the franchisee.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause explicitly binds the non-compete to **time (2 years)** and **territory (25 miles)**, which are the core elements of the query. It ensures the franchisor’s protection while providing clear boundaries for the franchisee’s post-termination activities.

Non-compete bound by time and territory,555c8639d5,"Gulf Oil and Gulf India each agree during the Non-Compete Period not to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of any businesses involved in, or otherwise competing with, the business of the Combined Business from any entity on Schedule 1 hereto.

Here’s the breakdown:

### **1. Time Bound (Non-Compete Period)**  
- The clause specifies a clear **duration**:  
  - Starts: **Effective Date** (when the agreement becomes enforceable).  
  - Ends: **Two years after the Closing Date** (the date the transaction is finalized).  
- This creates a **fixed 2-year restriction** post-closing, which is a standard but enforceable timeframe in many jurisdictions (subject to reasonableness tests).  

### **2. Territory Bound (Geographic Scope)**  
- The restriction applies **""anywhere in the world, excluding India.""**  
  - This is a **global non-compete** with a carve-out for India (likely due to separate terms for Gulf India or local legal constraints).  
  - Such broad territorial clauses are scrutinized for reasonableness but may be upheld if the Combined Business operates internationally.  

### **3. Prohibited Activities (Scope of Restriction)**  
The clause restricts:  
- **Direct or indirect ownership/control** of competing businesses.  
- **Management or operation** of competing entities.  
- **Investment or affiliation** (e.g., as a shareholder/partner) in competitors.  
- **Indirect competition** (e.g., through subsidiaries or third parties).  

### **Relevance to Query**  
- The clause directly addresses **time (2-year limit)** and **territory (worldwide, excluding India)**, which are core to assessing enforceability.  
- Courts often evaluate whether such restrictions are **reasonable in duration, geographic scope, and business necessity**. Here:  
  - **Time (2 years)**: Generally reasonable for global businesses.  
  - **Territory (worldwide)**: May be justified if the Combined Business operates globally, but India’s exclusion shows tailored drafting.  
- The clause also ties restrictions to the **""Combined Business""** (defined elsewhere), ensuring specificity.  

### **Potential Considerations**  
- **Enforceability**: Some jurisdictions (e.g., California, EU) may limit overly broad non-competes.  
- **Carve-outs**: The exclusion of India and allowance for passive ownership in Buyer’s stock show nuanced drafting to avoid overreach.  

In summary, this clause is a **classic example of a time- and territory-bound non-compete**, with careful attention to scope, exceptions, and business justification.",5

- Some restrictions (e.g., **sub-paragraph 14.2(f)**) apply **indefinitely** (e.g., using a business name similar to the Company’s).  

### **2. Territory Bound (""Restricted Territory"")**  
- The non-compete applies **only within the Restricted Territory**, meaning the employee is free to compete outside this geographical area.  
- The clause specifies that competitive actions (e.g., working for a competitor, soliciting customers, or engaging in similar business activities) are prohibited **only within this defined region**.  

### **3. Scope of Restricted Activities**  
The clause prevents the employee from:  
- **Working for a competitor** (directly or indirectly) in the Restricted Territory (14.2(a)).  
- **Starting or assisting a competing business** in the Restricted Territory (14.2(b), (c)).  
- **Poaching employees or customers** (14.2(d), (c)).  
- **Misrepresenting association with the Company** (14.2(e)).  
- **Using a confusingly similar business name** (14.2(f)).  

### **4. Reasonableness & Enforceability**  
For a non-compete to be enforceable, it must be **reasonable** in:  
- **Duration** (Restricted Period must not be excessive).  
- **Geographical scope** (Restricted Territory must align with the Company’s business reach).  
- **Protectable interests** (e.g., trade secrets, customer relationships).  

This clause attempts to balance the Company’s need to protect its business interests while not unduly restricting the employee’s future employment. However, its enforceability would depend on jurisdiction-specific laws (e.g., UK courts assess reasonableness under common law and statutory limits).

Non-compete bound by time and territory,82f2738b5e,"If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory. If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory.","The clause you provided is relevant to the **""Non-compete bound by time and territory""** query in the following ways:  

### **1. Territorial Restriction (Geography)**  
- The clause specifies that **Hydraspin will offer the Distributor the first opportunity** to become the exclusive distributor in a **new territory in the United States**.  
- This implies a **geographic limitation** where the Distributor may have exclusivity (or first refusal rights) within defined U.S. territories, restricting Hydraspin from freely appointing other distributors in those areas without first negotiating with the existing Distributor.  

### **2. Time-Bound Condition**  
- The clause imposes a **10-business-day deadline** for the Distributor to agree to exclusivity terms.  
- If no agreement is reached within this period, Hydraspin is **no longer obligated** to contract with the Distributor for that territory.  
- This creates a **time-bound restriction** on the Distributor’s right of first refusal.  

### **Relevance to Non-Compete**  
While this is not a traditional **non-compete clause** (which typically restricts a party from competing directly), it functions similarly by:  
- **Limiting Hydraspin’s ability to appoint competitors** in a given territory (unless the Distributor declines or fails to negotiate).  
- **Binding the Distributor to a short negotiation window**, after which Hydraspin can freely engage others.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is **territory-specific and time-bound**, aligning with the core elements of a non-compete restriction (geography and duration), though it operates more as a **right of first refusal** rather than a direct prohibition on competition.  

Would you like me to suggest modifications to make it a stronger non-compete clause?",4
Non-compete bound by time and territory,fced2d8f9c,"If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory.<omitted>If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory.","The clause you provided is relevant to the **""Non-compete bound by time and territory""** query in the following ways:  

### **1. Territorial Restriction (Bound by Territory)**  
- The clause specifies that Hydraspin will offer the **Distributor the first opportunity** to become the **exclusive distributor** for a **new territory in the United States**.  
- This implies a **territorial limitation**, as the Distributor’s exclusivity (and thus, non-compete protection) is tied to a defined geographic area (the ""new territory"").  
- If Hydraspin does not grant exclusivity, it may engage other distributors in that territory, meaning the non-compete is **conditional on territory**.  

### **2. Time-Bound Condition**  
- The clause imposes a **10-business-day deadline** for the Distributor to reach an exclusivity agreement.  
- If no agreement is reached within this timeframe, Hydraspin is **no longer obligated** to contract with the Distributor for that territory.  
- This creates a **time-bound restriction** on the Distributor’s right of first refusal, effectively limiting the duration of their negotiation privilege.  

### **Conclusion**  
While this is not a traditional non-compete clause (which typically restricts a party from competing post-termination), it **indirectly functions as a conditional non-compete** by:  
- **Restricting Hydraspin** from freely appointing other distributors in the new territory **unless** the Distributor fails to agree within the 10-day window.  
- **Limiting the Distributor’s exclusivity rights** to a defined **territory** and **timeframe**.  

For a stricter non-compete, you might expect explicit language prohibiting competition (e.g., ""Distributor shall not sell competing products in Territory X for 1 year after termination""). However, this clause still aligns with the **time and territory** aspects of your query.

Exclusivity bound by time and territory,05ef7e7d77,"This Agreement and any and all matters arising directly or indirectly herefrom shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the [***] applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely in such state, including its statutes of limitation but without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.","The clause you provided is a **governing law clause**, which specifies the legal jurisdiction and applicable laws for interpreting and enforcing the agreement. While it does not directly address **exclusivity bound by time and territory**, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### **1. Indirect Impact on Exclusivity Terms**  
- If the agreement includes exclusivity provisions (e.g., restricting a party from competing in certain regions or timeframes), this clause determines which jurisdiction's laws will govern the enforceability of those restrictions.  
- Some states/countries have stricter rules on **non-compete or exclusivity clauses** (e.g., California generally disfavors them, while other jurisdictions may enforce them if reasonable in duration and geographic scope).  

### **2. Enforcement of Time & Territory Restrictions**  
- The clause ensures that any disputes over exclusivity (e.g., whether a party violated territorial or time-based restrictions) will be resolved under the chosen state’s laws.  
- If the exclusivity terms are challenged in court, the governing law will determine whether they are **reasonable and enforceable** (e.g., courts may strike down overly broad restrictions).  

### **3. Conflict Avoidance**  
- By excluding **conflict of law principles**, the clause prevents courts from applying another jurisdiction’s laws that might weaken exclusivity terms.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
While this clause does not define exclusivity terms itself, it ensures that any such terms in the agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the specified state’s laws—which could be crucial if exclusivity is later disputed.

Exclusivity bound by time and territory,8424ab4201,"This Agreement and all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any breach hereof are governed by and construed under the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law principles that would require the application of the Laws of a different state.","The query relates to **""Exclusivity bound by time and territory,""** which typically refers to contractual restrictions on one party's ability to compete or operate within a specific geographic area or time period. However, the clause you provided is a **governing law (choice of law) clause**, not an exclusivity clause.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
While the clause does not directly address exclusivity in terms of time or territory, it is relevant in the following ways:  

1. **Interpretation of Exclusivity Terms**  
   - If the contract includes exclusivity provisions (e.g., prohibiting a party from operating in a certain region for a set time), this clause ensures that **New York law** will govern how those terms are interpreted and enforced.  
   - Different states may have varying rules on the enforceability of exclusivity clauses (e.g., reasonableness of time/territory restrictions). New York courts will apply their own precedents.  

2. **Dispute Resolution**  
   - Any legal challenge to the exclusivity terms (e.g., a claim that the restrictions are too broad) would be resolved under New York law.  
   - New York courts may apply principles like **reasonableness** when assessing whether time/territory restrictions are enforceable.  

3. **Avoiding Conflicting Laws**  
   - If the parties operate in multiple states or countries, this clause prevents another jurisdiction’s laws from invalidating the exclusivity terms.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
This clause does not create exclusivity but ensures that **if** the contract contains exclusivity terms (time/territory-based), their enforceability will be determined under New York law. For actual exclusivity restrictions, a separate clause would be needed.

Exclusivity bound by time and territory,ea85d96226,"This Agreement and all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any breach hereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.","The clause you provided is a **governing law** (or **choice of law**) clause, which specifies that the laws of New York will apply to the agreement and any disputes arising from it. However, this clause does not directly address **exclusivity bound by time and territory**, which typically involves restrictions on when and where a party can operate or compete.

### Relevance to the Query:
1. **Indirect Impact on Exclusivity Terms**  
   - While the clause does not explicitly define exclusivity in terms of time or territory, the governing law (New York) will determine how such exclusivity provisions are interpreted and enforced.  
   - New York contract law may impose certain limitations or requirements on exclusivity clauses (e.g., reasonableness in duration and geographic scope to avoid being deemed an unenforceable restraint of trade).

2. **Dispute Resolution Implications**  
   - If a dispute arises over whether an exclusivity clause (e.g., a non-compete or territorial restriction) is valid, New York courts (or arbitrators, if applicable) will decide based on New York law.  
   - New York generally enforces reasonable exclusivity restrictions but may strike down overly broad ones.

3. **No Direct Conflict, but Potential Interaction**  
   - If the agreement includes a separate exclusivity clause (e.g., ""Party A has exclusive rights to sell Product X in Region Y for 2 years""), this governing law clause ensures New York law governs its enforceability.  
   - For example, New York courts might assess whether the time/territory restrictions are reasonable under state precedent.

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause is **not directly about exclusivity** but ensures that any exclusivity terms in the agreement will be interpreted under New York law. If the query seeks to draft or analyze an exclusivity clause, this governing law provision would influence how such a clause is enforced. For a complete answer, the agreement should also include a separate **exclusivity clause** defining the time and territory limits.

Exclusivity bound by time and territory,b3497945c4,"[***], neither Valeant nor its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, [***] in the Territory other than the Product; provided that if the Agreement is terminated by Dova pursuant to [***], then any Tail Period shall be immediately terminated if either Valeant or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, [***] in the Territory other than the Product during such Tail Period.","This clause addresses the **exclusivity** obligations of Valeant and its Affiliates, which are **bound by both time and territory**, directly responding to the query. Here’s how:

1. **Exclusivity by Territory**:  
   - The clause restricts Valeant and its Affiliates from engaging in certain activities (redacted as `[***]`) **within the defined ""Territory""**, except for actions related to ""the Product."" This creates a **geographic (territorial) exclusivity** obligation.

2. **Exclusivity by Time**:  
   - The restriction applies for the **duration of the Agreement**.  
   - Additionally, it references a **""Tail Period""** (a post-termination timeframe), implying that exclusivity may extend beyond termination under certain conditions.  
   - However, if the Agreement is terminated by Dova under specific conditions (redacted as `[***]`), the Tail Period’s exclusivity **terminates immediately** if Valeant or its Affiliates violate the territorial restriction during that period.  

3. **Conditional Exclusivity**:  
   - The clause includes a **carve-out** where exclusivity is **not absolute**—it allows exceptions (e.g., activities related to ""the Product"").  
   - It also **links exclusivity to termination rights**, making the temporal aspect contingent on compliance during the Tail Period.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause explicitly structures exclusivity around:  
- **Territory** (limiting actions to a defined geographic area).  
- **Time** (duration of the Agreement + conditional Tail Period).  

Thus, it directly governs how and where exclusivity applies, ensuring Valeant’s obligations are **spatially and temporally confined**. The termination trigger further refines the temporal boundary, making exclusivity **context-dependent**.

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query**  
The provided clause is a **governing law and jurisdiction provision**, which does not directly address exclusivity in terms of time and territory. However, it is relevant in the following ways:  

1. **Interpretation & Enforcement of Exclusivity Terms**  
   - If the agreement includes exclusivity clauses (e.g., restricting a party from competing in a certain region for a set time), this clause ensures that **Israeli law** will govern how those restrictions are interpreted and enforced.  
   - Some jurisdictions may impose stricter limits on exclusivity (e.g., non-compete clauses), so choosing Israeli law provides predictability.  

2. **Dispute Resolution for Breach of Exclusivity**  
   - If a party violates an exclusivity clause (e.g., operates in a restricted territory or time), any legal dispute would be resolved under **Israeli law**, including applicable statutes of limitations.  

3. **Conflict of Laws Avoidance**  
   - The clause prevents another jurisdiction’s laws from invalidating or modifying exclusivity terms (e.g., if another country’s laws prohibit strict territorial restrictions).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
While this clause does not **define** exclusivity in terms of time or territory, it ensures that any such restrictions in the agreement will be interpreted and enforced under **Israeli law**, providing legal certainty in case of disputes.

No-Solicit of Customers,87addb8ad7,"Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations).","The clause you provided is a **No-Solicit of Employees** provision, not a **No-Solicit of Customers** clause. However, I can explain how a similar structure would apply to a **No-Solicit of Customers** clause based on the given example.

### **Relevance to a No-Solicit of Customers Clause**  
If the query is about restricting the solicitation of customers (rather than employees), the clause would need to be modified as follows:  

> *""Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or transact business with any customer of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general advertisements or public solicitations that are not specifically targeted at the other party’s customers.""*  

### **Key Elements in Relation to the Query**  
1. **Parties Bound** – SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agree not to poach each other’s customers.  
2. **Restricted Activity** – Prohibits **solicitation** (direct outreach) and **transacting business** (entering into agreements) with the other party’s customers.  
3. **Time Limit** – Applies during the **term of the agreement** and for **12 months after termination**.  
4. **Exception** – Allows **general marketing** (e.g., public ads, broad campaigns) as long as it is not **specifically targeting** the other party’s customers.  

### **Why This Structure is Useful for No-Solicit of Customers**  
- Prevents unfair competition by stopping one party from **actively poaching** the other’s clients.  
- Balances restrictions with **permissible business activities** (e.g., mass marketing).  
- Provides a **clear time limit** to avoid indefinite restraints on trade.

However, I can explain its relevance to your query by clarifying the distinction between the two and how this clause functions in a contract.  

### **Relevance to Your Query:**  
1. **Misalignment with Query** – Your query asks about a **""No-Solicit of Customers""** clause (which restricts soliciting the other party’s customers), but the provided clause restricts **soliciting employees** (a ""No-Poach"" or ""Non-Solicitation of Employees"" clause).  
   - If you intended to review a **customer non-solicit**, this is not the correct clause.  

2. **Key Elements of the Provided Clause (No-Solicit of Employees):**  
   - **Restricted Period**: A defined duration (redacted as `[***]`) from the Effective Date.  
   - **Prohibited Actions**:  
     - Direct or indirect solicitation of the other party’s employees (or their affiliates).  
     - Inducing employees to leave their current employer.  
   - **Exceptions**:  
     - General public job postings (not targeted at the other party’s employees).  
     - Hiring someone who applies through such general ads is allowed.  

3. **Why This Might Be Confused with a Customer Non-Solicit:**  
   - Both clauses restrict certain business interactions between parties post-agreement.  
   - A **customer non-solicit** would similarly prohibit actively targeting the other party’s clients but would focus on business relationships rather than employment.  

### **If You Need a ""No-Solicit of Customers"" Clause:**  
A typical version would include:  
- A prohibition on **directly or indirectly** soliciting or doing business with the other party’s customers.  
- A defined **timeframe** (e.g., 1–2 years).  
- Possible **exceptions** (e.g., responding to unsolicited inquiries).

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Scope of Restriction**  
   - The Consultant is prohibited from **directly or indirectly** soliciting or promoting the solicitation of the Company’s clients/customers.  
   - The restriction applies to:  
     - Clients/customers with whom the Consultant had **""Material Contact""** (e.g., direct business interactions).  
     - Prospective customers about whom the Consultant received **Confidential Information**.  

2. **Timeframe**  
   - The restriction applies **during the Term** of the agreement and for **1 year after termination**.  

3. **Purpose of the Restriction**  
   - The Consultant cannot solicit these customers **for the purpose of providing Competitive Products/Services** (i.e., services/products that compete with the Company’s offerings).  

### **Why This Matters for ""No-Solicit of Customers""**  
- It **protects the Company’s business relationships** by preventing the Consultant from poaching clients after their engagement ends.  
- It ensures that **Confidential Information** (e.g., customer lists, preferences) is not misused to divert business.  
- It defines **clear boundaries** (time, scope, and definition of restricted customers) to make the clause enforceable.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **General Permission to Solicit Outside Territory**  
   - The clause allows the Distributor to **advertise, promote, market, or solicit** customers **outside its assigned Territory**, unless restricted by other terms.  

2. **Exception: Exclusive Distributor Agreements**  
   - The Distributor is **prohibited** from soliciting customers in any **outside territory** where **Hydraspin** has an **exclusive distributor agreement** with a third party.  
   - This restriction applies **only if** Hydraspin has provided **written notice** to the Distributor, specifying:  
     - The existence of the exclusive agreement with another distributor.  
     - The exact territory covered by that exclusivity.  

3. **Key Relevance to ""No-Solicit""**  
   - The clause functions as a **partial no-solicit restriction**, limiting the Distributor’s ability to target customers in territories where Hydraspin has granted exclusivity to others.  
   - It balances **business development rights** (allowing solicitation in non-exclusive areas) with **protection for Hydraspin’s contractual commitments** (preventing interference with exclusive distributors).  

### Summary  
This clause ensures that while the Distributor can generally pursue customers outside its Territory, it must **avoid solicitation in regions where Hydraspin has granted exclusivity to another distributor**, provided proper notice has been given. This aligns with the intent behind a **no-solicit provision**—preventing unfair competition while allowing reasonable business expansion.

Here’s how it addresses the broader concept of solicitation restrictions:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Permitted Solicitation of Employees**  
   - Sellers are allowed to:  
     - Solicit/hire former employees of Buyer/Company **if their employment ended at least six months prior**.  
     - Use **general public solicitations** (e.g., job postings, mass emails) to recruit employees of the Combined Business, as long as the outreach is not **specifically targeted** at them.  
     - However, **hiring** employees of the Combined Business is **prohibited during the Non-Solicit Period** (3 years post-Closing).  

2. **Prohibited Solicitation of Employees**  
   - During the **Non-Solicit Period**, Sellers **cannot**:  
     - Directly or indirectly **solicit, recruit, or induce** employees of the Combined Business to leave their jobs.  
     - **Hire** any employees of the Combined Business, even if approached through a general solicitation.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- While the query mentions **""No-Solicit of Customers,""** this clause instead governs **employee non-solicitation**. It ensures that:  
  - The Buyer’s workforce is protected from poaching by Sellers post-transaction.  
  - Sellers retain limited rights to recruit former employees (after a 6-month cooling-off period) or through broad, non-targeted methods.  
- If the query intended to address **customer** non-solicitation, this clause does not cover it. A separate provision would typically restrict soliciting the Buyer’s clients or business relationships.  

### Suggested Clarification:  
If the user seeks a **customer** non-solicit clause, they should review or request language specifically prohibiting:  
- Directly contacting the Buyer’s customers.  
- Using confidential customer lists to solicit business.  
- Interfering with customer relationships post-transaction.

No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,77df66b5ca,"Each Party agrees that, during the [***] ([***]) [***] period starting from the Effective Date, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates or otherwise induce or attempt to induce such employees to terminate their employment with such other Party or such other Party's Affiliates; provided, however, that general public solicitations and advertisements not directed at employees of the other Party, and the extension of offers to persons who respond to such general solicitations and advertisements, will not be deemed violations of this provision.","The query raises two key concerns about the **No-Solicit of Employees** clause:  
1. Whether the restriction is **not bound by time** (i.e., potentially indefinite).  
2. Whether the restriction lasts **longer than 12 months**.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Time-Bound Restriction**:  
   - The clause explicitly includes a **fixed duration** (marked by `[***]` placeholders, typically filled with a specific number).  
   - It is **not indefinite**—it applies only for the agreed-upon period starting from the **Effective Date**.  

2. **Duration (12+ Months)**:  
   - The placeholder `[***] ([***]) [***]` suggests the parties must define the length (e.g., ""12-month"" or ""24-month"").  
   - If the finalized clause specifies a period **longer than 12 months**, it would align with the query’s concern. However, as drafted, the duration is negotiable.  

3. **Exceptions**:  
   - The clause carves out **general public solicitations** (e.g., job postings not targeting the other party’s employees), which mitigates overreach.  

### **Key Takeaway**:  
The clause is **time-bound** (not indefinite) and **negotiable in duration**. If the finalized agreement sets a period exceeding 12 months, it would address the query’s concern directly. For enforceability, most jurisdictions require such restrictions to be **reasonable in scope and duration** (often ≤12 months). A longer period may risk being struck down unless justified by exceptional circumstances.

### **1. Time-Bound Restriction (Longer than 12 Months)**  
The clause imposes a **three-year Non-Solicit Period** (from the Effective Date until three years after the Closing Date), which is significantly longer than the 12-month threshold mentioned in the query. This restricts Sellers from:

The clause includes **two key exceptions** where the no-solicit restriction **does not apply indefinitely**:  
   - **(1) Former Employees Terminated ≥6 Months Prior** – Sellers can freely solicit/hire employees who were terminated by Buyer/Company **at least six months before** the solicitation, regardless of the Non-Solicit Period.  
   - **(2) General Solicitations (Non-Targeted)** – Sellers can use **public, non-targeted hiring methods** (e.g., job boards, mass emails) to solicit employees, but they **cannot hire** them during the Non-Solicit Period.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **exceeds 12 months** (three-year restriction).  
- It also **carves out exceptions** where solicitation is **not time-bound** (e.g., former employees terminated ≥6 months ago can always be solicited).  

Thus, the clause aligns with the query by demonstrating a **long-term (3-year) no-solicit obligation** while also allowing **permanent exceptions** in certain cases.",5
No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,87addb8ad7,"Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations).","The query raises two key concerns regarding the **No-Solicit of Employees** clause:  
1. Whether the restriction is **not bound by time** (i.e., potentially indefinite).  
2. Whether the restriction is **longer than 12 months**.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **Time-Bound Restriction (12 Months):**  
   - The clause explicitly limits the no-solicit obligation to **""during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter.""**  
   - This means the restriction is **not indefinite**—it expires after the Agreement ends + 12 months.  

2. **Duration (Not Longer Than 12 Months):**  
   - The 12-month post-termination period is clearly defined, so the restriction does **not exceed** 12 months after the Agreement ends.  
   - Some jurisdictions may scrutinize longer durations (e.g., 18+ months) as unreasonable restraints on trade, but this clause avoids that issue.  

3. **Exceptions (General Solicitations):**  
   - The clause carves out **general public solicitations** (e.g., job postings, LinkedIn ads) unless they **target** the other party’s employees specifically.  
   - This mitigates overbreadth concerns while protecting legitimate business interests.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **directly addresses the query** by:  
- Imposing a **fixed 12-month post-agreement limit** (not indefinite).  
- Avoiding a duration longer than 12 months.  
- Including reasonable exceptions to balance enforceability.  

If the query seeks to challenge the clause, the **time-bound and narrowly tailored** nature strengthens its enforceability in most jurisdictions. However, local laws (e.g., California’s stricter rules on employee mobility) should be reviewed.

No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,a804319d22,"Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the ""Non-Solicit Period""), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. <omitted>
Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former <omitted> employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.","The query concerns whether a **no-solicit of employees clause** is **bound by time** (i.e., whether it has a defined duration) and whether it is **longer than 12 months**.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Time-Bound Restriction**  
   - The clause explicitly imposes a **fixed duration** (a ""Non-Solicit Period"") that begins on the **Effective Date** and ends **three years after the Closing Date**.  
   - This means the restriction is **not indefinite**—it is strictly limited to a **three-year post-closing period**.  

2. **Duration Longer Than 12 Months**  
   - The **three-year restriction** is significantly **longer than 12 months**, which may be relevant if the query is assessing enforceability or market norms (as some jurisdictions limit non-solicit durations).  

3. **Exceptions to the Rule**  
   - The clause includes **carve-outs** (e.g., hiring former employees terminated at least six months prior, or general public solicitations not targeting specific employees).  
   - However, these exceptions **do not shorten the overall three-year restriction**—they merely clarify permissible actions within that timeframe.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **is time-bound (3 years)** and **exceeds 12 months**, directly addressing the query’s concern about duration. If the question relates to enforceability, further analysis of governing law would be needed, as some jurisdictions may limit non-solicit periods to shorter terms (e.g., 6–12 months).  

Would you like an assessment of enforceability based on a specific jurisdiction?",5
No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,f4f18fbcb1,"During the term hereof and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, each Party agrees not to, either directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of any other person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity hire, solicit, contract for, attempt to solicit, or cause to be solicited, the employment or services of any current or previous employee of the other Party (unless a period of sixty months has elapsed from the last date that such employee was employed by such party) without the prior written consent of such other Party.","The query raises two key concerns about the **No-Solicit of Employees** clause:  
1. Whether the restriction is **not bound by time** (i.e., potentially perpetual).  
2. Whether the restriction lasts **longer than 12 months**.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **Time Bound vs. Perpetual**:  
   - The clause **is time-bound**, not perpetual. It applies:  
     - **During the term of the agreement** (active contract period).  
     - **Plus an additional 5 years** after termination/expiration.  
   - The restriction expires after the 5-year post-termination period, so it is not open-ended.  

2. **Duration Longer Than 12 Months**:  
   - The post-termination restriction lasts **5 years (60 months)**, which is significantly longer than the 12-month benchmark mentioned in the query.  
   - Many jurisdictions scrutinize lengthy non-solicits (especially beyond 1–2 years) for reasonableness. A 5-year ban may be unenforceable in some regions unless justified by exceptional circumstances (e.g., trade secrets, high-level executives).  

3. **Additional Employee Protection**:  
   - The clause also includes a **60-month (5-year) ""cooling-off"" period** for former employees—meaning a Party cannot solicit **any** employee who left the other Party within the last 5 years unless consent is given.  
   - This extends protection beyond current employees to recent departures, further exceeding typical 12-month norms.  

### **Key Takeaway**:  
The clause explicitly exceeds the 12-month threshold (imposing a 5-year restriction) and is time-bound (not perpetual). However, its enforceability may depend on jurisdiction and whether the duration is deemed reasonable under applicable law. If the query seeks to limit the restriction, negotiation for a shorter period (e.g., 12–24 months) may be advisable.

Non-Disparagement,4e171b11c4,"Subject to applicable law, each of the Parties covenants and agrees that, during the Standstill Period, neither Party nor any of its subsidiaries, Affiliates, successors, assigns, principals, partners, members, general partners, officers, key employees or directors (collectively, ""Representatives""), shall in any way, directly or indirectly, in any capacity or manner, whether written or oral, electronically or otherwise (including, without limitation, in a television, radio, internet, newspaper, magazine interview, or otherwise through the press, media, analysts or other persons or in any document or report filed with the SEC), publicly disparage, impugn, make ad hominem attacks on or otherwise defame or slander or make, express, transmit, speak, write, verbalize or otherwise publicly communicate in any way (or cause, further, assist, solicit, encourage, support or participate in any of the foregoing), any public communication or statement of any kind, whether verbal, in writing, electronically transferred or otherwise, that might reasonably be construed to be disparage, derogate or impugn, the other Party or such other Party's Representatives (including any current officer or director of a Party or a Parties' subsidiaries who no longer serves in such capacity following the execution of this Agreement), employees, stockholders (solely in their capacity as stockholders of the applicable Party), or any of their businesses, products or services, in any manner that would reasonably be expected to damage the business, or reputation of the other Party or of its Representatives (including former officers and directors), directors (or former directors), employees, stockholders (solely in their capacity as stockholders of the applicable Party); provided that, with respect to any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding between the Parties, nothing in this Section 5 shall prevent either Party from disclosing any facts or circumstances with respect to any such litigation, arbitration or other proceeding.","This **Non-Disparagement Clause** is directly relevant to the query as it imposes a mutual obligation on both parties (and their representatives) to refrain from making any negative or harmful public statements about each other during the **Standstill Period**. Below is a breakdown of its key aspects in relation to the query:

### **1. Scope of Prohibited Conduct**  
The clause broadly prohibits:  
- **Public disparagement, defamation, slander, or ad hominem attacks** against the other party or its representatives.  
- Any **written, oral, or electronic communication** (including media interviews, SEC filings, social media, etc.) that could harm the other party’s **business, reputation, or individuals** (e.g., executives, employees, shareholders).  

### **2. Covered Parties**  
The restriction applies not just to the **primary parties** but also extends to their:  
- **Subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, officers, directors, key employees, and other representatives.**  
- **Former officers/directors** (even if they leave after the agreement is signed).  

### **3. Permitted Exceptions**  
- **Legal Proceedings**: Either party can still disclose facts related to **litigation, arbitration, or other legal disputes** between them.  
- **Compliance with Law**: The clause is subject to **applicable law**, meaning it cannot override legal obligations (e.g., regulatory disclosures).  

### **4. Relevance to the Query**  
The clause ensures that neither party engages in **public criticism, smear campaigns, or damaging statements** that could harm the other’s reputation or business interests. This is particularly important in:  
- **M&A or settlement agreements** (where maintaining goodwill is crucial).  
- **Employment or separation agreements** (to prevent former employees from badmouthing the company).  
- **Investor or shareholder disputes** (to avoid market manipulation or reputational harm).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This **Non-Disparagement Clause** is a **strong legal safeguard** preventing either party from making harmful public statements, while still allowing necessary disclosures in legal disputes. It balances **reputational protection** with **legal practicality**.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **Scope of Prohibited Conduct**  
   - The parties agree not to make any **written or oral communication** (including opinions, judgments, or factual representations) that could **disparage, criticize, or reflect negatively** on the other party, its business, or its stakeholders (e.g., employees, investors, products, or services).  
   - This applies to **third parties**, including customers, suppliers, and competitors.

2. **Duration**  
   - The restriction applies **during the agreement’s term** and for **two years after termination/expiration**, ensuring post-contract protection.

3. **Employee Responsibility**  
   - Each party must use **reasonable commercial efforts** to prevent its employees from making disparaging remarks, extending the obligation beyond just the contracting entities.

4. **Exceptions**  
   - The clause does **not restrict a party’s legal rights or remedies** under the agreement (e.g., enforcing breach claims or defending against allegations). This ensures compliance with legal fairness principles.

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
- **Protects Reputation:** Prevents public or private criticism that could harm business relationships or market perception.  
- **Legal Enforceability:** Violations could lead to claims for breach of contract or even defamation.  
- **Balanced Restriction:** The carve-out for legal rights ensures the clause isn’t overly restrictive.  

### **Practical Implications**  
- Parties must **train employees** to avoid negative statements.  
- **Social media, reviews, or industry discussions** could be covered under ""Communications.""  
- **Remedies for breach** may include injunctions or damages.

The Client and Designer both agree not to post on defamatory websites or review websites any negative posts concerning each other, the names of our companies, and our employees.","The **Non-Disparagement Clause** you provided is directly relevant to the query as it establishes a mutual agreement between the **Client** and the **Designer** to refrain from making negative or harmful statements about each other, both verbally and online. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Prohibition of Negative Statements** – Both parties agree not to **disparage** (criticize or speak ill of) each other in any form, whether in private conversations, public statements, or online platforms.  

2. **Scope of Protection** – The clause extends beyond just the two parties to include their **products, services, affiliates, employees, and executives**, ensuring broader protection against reputational harm.  

3. **Online Conduct** – Specifically prohibits posting negative reviews or comments on **defamatory websites, review platforms, or social media**, which could damage the other party’s reputation.  

4. **Preventive Measures** – Requires both parties to take **reasonable steps** to prevent their employees or agents from engaging in such behavior, reinforcing accountability.  

5. **Legal Enforceability** – By formalizing this agreement in a contract, either party could take legal action (e.g., for breach of contract or defamation) if the other violates the clause.  

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
If the query is about whether such a clause is enforceable or what it covers, this clause is a strong **mutual non-disparagement agreement** designed to protect both parties’ reputations and business interests. It is particularly relevant in industries where public perception (e.g., design, branding, or professional services) is critical.

Non-Disparagement,9cc5d7efc1,"Any assignment in derogation of the foregoing shall be null and void. Neither party may<omitted>assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement to any person or entity without the
other's written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that the withholding of consent of assignment to a competitor of the other party shall be deemed reasonable.","The **Non-Disparagement** query appears to be unrelated to the provided **assignment clause**. However, I can explain the relevance of the clause itself and why it might be mistakenly associated with non-disparagement.  

### **Explanation of the Clause:**  
The clause restricts the **assignment or transfer** of the agreement without the other party's written consent, which cannot be unreasonably withheld—except when assigning to a **competitor**, where withholding consent is deemed reasonable.  

### **Possible Connection to Non-Disparagement:**  
1. **Indirect Protection from Harmful Assignments** – If one party assigns the agreement to a competitor, the other party may fear reputational harm or disparagement (e.g., a competitor gaining access to sensitive information and using it negatively).  
2. **Control Over Business Relationships** – Preventing assignments to competitors helps avoid situations where a hostile entity could misuse the agreement to damage the other party’s reputation.  

### **Why It’s Not Directly About Non-Disparagement:**  
- The clause does **not** explicitly prohibit negative statements (disparagement).  
- It focuses on **assignment rights**, not conduct like public criticism.  

### **If Non-Disparagement Was Intended:**  
A true non-disparagement clause would explicitly state that neither party may make harmful statements about the other. Since this is missing, the relevance is only tangential (preventing assignments that could lead to reputational risks).

1. **Protection of Reputation & Value of Marks** – The clause prohibits either party from taking actions that could harm the other party's trademarks (Marks), including diminishing their value or reputation. Disparaging remarks or public challenges could damage the goodwill associated with the Marks, which this clause seeks to prevent.  

2. **Prohibition on Negative Actions** – The clause explicitly bars parties from:  
   - **Challenging ownership, validity, or enforceability** of the Marks (which could be seen as a form of legal or reputational disparagement).  
   - **Engaging in acts that reduce the value** of the Marks (e.g., making negative public statements or undermining their market perception).  

3. **Indirect Disparagement** – The clause covers not just direct criticism but also **indirect actions** that could harm the Marks' reputation, ensuring broad protection against disparagement in any form.  

### **Relevance to Non-Disparagement**  
While not explicitly labeled as a ""Non-Disparagement Clause,"" this provision functions similarly by preventing either party from:  
- Making derogatory statements (explicit or implied) about the other party’s Marks.  
- Engaging in conduct (legal challenges, public disputes, etc.) that could be interpreted as undermining the Marks’ reputation.  

Thus, it serves as a **de facto non-disparagement agreement** specifically focused on intellectual property (trademarks) rather than general business conduct.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Definitions and Distinctions**  
   - **ROFR (Right of First Refusal)**: The clause specifies that the Farids Group must provide a **ROFR Sale Notice** to the Company before transferring shares to a third party, allowing the Company (or its designee) to match the terms and purchase the shares instead.  
   - **ROFO (Right of First Offer)**: The Farids Group must issue a **ROFO Sale Notice** to the Company before initiating a **144 Sale** (a Rule 144 resale of restricted securities), giving the Company the right to purchase the shares at the proposed price.  
   - **ROFN (Right of First Negotiation)**: While not explicitly named here, the clause implies a negotiation dynamic (e.g., the Company’s right to counter or waive the offer).  

### 2. **Key Provisions**  
   - **Notice Requirements**:  
     - **ROFR Sale Notice**: Must be delivered **5 business days** before a proposed transfer (e.g., to a competitor).  
     - **ROFO Sale Notice**: Must be delivered **48 hours** before a **144 Sale**.  
   - **Transfer Restrictions**:  
     - The Farids Group cannot issue more than one ROFR/ROFO notice in a **30-day period**.  
     - If the transfer isn’t completed within the specified period (**ROFR Transfer Period** or **ROFO Transfer Period**), a new notice is required.  
   - **Company’s Rights**:  
     - The Company can match the terms (price, transferee) in a ROFR or ROFO scenario.  
     - Failure to respond within the deadline (e.g., **3 business days for ROFR**, same-day for ROFO) waives the Company’s rights.  

### 3. **Competitor Protections**  
   - The clause imposes stricter rules for transfers to **material competitors** (requiring due inquiry and Company approval).  

### 4. **Process Flow**  
   - **ROFR**:  
     1. Farids Group sends a ROFR Sale Notice with terms.  
     2. Company has 3 days to issue a **ROFR Purchase Notice** (or waive rights).  
     3. Closing occurs within 5 business days of the notice.  
   - **ROFO**:  
     1. Farids Group notifies the Company of a **144 Sale**.  
     2. Company must respond by **8:00 a.m. on the proposed sale day**.  
     3. Unpurchased shares can be sold in the open market (but not below the ROFO Sale Price).  

### 5. **Relevance to Query**  
   - The clause **defines ROFR/ROFO mechanics**, including triggers, timelines, and consequences.  
   - It highlights the **differences** between ROFR (matching third-party offers) and ROFO (pre-sale offering to the Company).  
   - While **ROFN** isn’t explicitly named, the negotiation aspect is embedded in the Company’s right to accept/decline offers.  

### Summary  
This clause is a **detailed framework** for how ROFR and ROFO operate in the agreement, addressing notice requirements, transfer limitations, and the Company’s preferential rights. It answers the query by clarifying the **practical application** of these rights in share transfers.",5
Rofr/Rofo/Rofn,d90ac097df,"XSPA shall give prompt written notice to Calm each time it offers, proposes to offer, or has received an offer to enter into any agreement or arrangement under which XSPA or any of its affiliates would sell, offer for sale, market, promote or undertake any similar action with respect to any meditation or sleep digital products or similar products at any Store outside the Territory (each, a ""ROFR Notice"").<omitted>If Calm exercises its ROFR within the ROFR Period, the Parties shall enter into an amendment or addendum to this Agreement to include such additional region and/or Stores.<omitted>If Calm does not exercise its ROFR within the ROFR Period, XSPA may enter into such agreement or arrangement with respect to the applicable region and/or Stores set forth in the ROFR Notice with any third party; provided that, such agreement or arrangement are on the same terms offered to Calm (it being understood that in the event XSPA modifies such terms, XSPA shall provide a new ROFR Notice to Calm in accordance with this Section \u200b3.02).<omitted>Throughout the Term and for a period of six (6) months after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Calm shall have a right of first refusal to expand the rights and obligations described in this Agreement to any Stores outside the Territory (the ""ROFR"").<omitted>Calm shall have thirty (30) business days (the ""ROFR Period"") from receipt of a ROFR Notice to exercise its ROFR with respect to the region and/or Stores described in the ROFR Notice.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **ROFR (Right of First Refusal) / ROFO (Right of First Offer) / ROFN (Right of First Negotiation)**. Here’s how it aligns with these concepts:

### 1. **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)**  
   - The clause explicitly grants **Calm a ROFR** to expand its rights to **Stores outside the Territory** if XSPA receives or makes an offer from/to a third party.  
   - Key ROFR mechanics:  
     - **Trigger**: XSPA must send a **ROFR Notice** to Calm when it receives or proposes an offer for selling/marketing meditation/sleep products outside the Territory.  
     - **Exercise Window**: Calm has **30 business days (ROFR Period)** to match the terms and accept the offer.  
     - **Outcome**:  
       - If Calm exercises the ROFR, the parties amend the agreement to include the new region/Stores.  
       - If Calm declines, XSPA may proceed with the third party **on the same terms** (or re-notify Calm if terms change).  

### 2. **Right of First Offer (ROFO) Elements**  
   - While not a pure ROFO (where the rights holder gets the first chance to make an offer before third parties), this clause has a **ROFO-like feature**:  
     - XSPA must notify Calm **before** entering into any agreement with a third party, effectively giving Calm the first opportunity to accept the terms.  

### 3. **Right of First Negotiation (ROFN) Comparison**  
   - A ROFN typically grants the rights holder an exclusive negotiation period before the owner can talk to third parties.  
   - This clause is **not a ROFN**, as it doesn’t require XSPA to negotiate exclusively with Calm before seeking third-party offers. Instead, Calm’s right is triggered only after XSPA has concrete terms to share.  

### Key Takeaways:  
- The clause is a **classic ROFR** (with ROFO-like notice requirements).  
- It ensures Calm gets the **first right to match** any third-party offer before XSPA proceeds.  
- The **30-day ROFR Period** and **same-terms condition** are standard ROFR protections.

Rofr/Rofo/Rofn,051c3e266c,"All communication with the National Football League (the ""NFL""), its 32 Member Clubs, NFL Legends and Gold Jackets shall be made exclusively and directly through PFHOF. For the avoidance of doubt, PFHOF has the exclusive and sole relationship with the NFL, its 32 Member Clubs, NFL Legends and Gold Jackets for any and all PFHOF and HOFV activities; provided, however, that any communication relating to any investment by the NFL in any Village Media Company project, may be made directly through the President of PFHOF or the Chief Executive Officer of HOFV; and, provided further, that the Village Media Company shall have the right to present opportunities related to any of the above for approval by PFHOF.","The query mentions **ROFR/ROFO/ROFN** (Right of First Refusal/Right of First Offer/Right of First Negotiation), which are contractual rights giving a party priority in purchasing, receiving offers, or negotiating for certain assets or opportunities before others.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to ROFR/ROFO/ROFN:**  
1. **Exclusive Communication & Control (Implied ROFR/ROFO):**  
   - The clause mandates that **all communication** with the NFL, its clubs, and Legends must go **exclusively through PFHOF**, effectively giving PFHOF control over these relationships.  
   - This could function similarly to a **ROFR/ROFO** by ensuring PFHOF has the **first opportunity** to engage in or approve any deals involving these entities before others (e.g., Village Media Company).  

2. **Investment Exception (Potential ROFR/ROFN):**  
   - While direct communication is allowed for NFL investments in Village Media projects (via PFHOF’s President or HOFV’s CEO), the **Village Media Company must still present opportunities to PFHOF for approval**.  
   - This suggests PFHOF retains a **right to review or negotiate first** (akin to ROFR/ROFN) before Village Media can proceed with NFL-related opportunities.  

3. **Approval Mechanism (ROFR-like Protection):**  
   - The requirement for PFHOF’s approval over Village Media’s proposals implies PFHOF has a **veto or priority right**, ensuring it can block or shape deals—similar to how a ROFR/ROFO would operate.  

### **Conclusion:**  
Though the clause doesn’t explicitly label these rights as ROFR/ROFO/ROFN, it **functionally creates similar protections** by:  
- Restricting direct dealings (giving PFHOF first control).  
- Requiring PFHOF approval for third-party (Village Media) opportunities.  
- Allowing exceptions only under PFHOF’s oversight.  

This aligns with the **spirit of ROFR/ROFO/ROFN** by ensuring PFHOF maintains priority in NFL-related engagements. For explicit ROFR/ROFO/ROFN terms, the contract would need clearer language (e.g., ""PFHOF shall have a right of first refusal on any NFL-related commercial opportunities"").

### **Relevance of the Clause to ROFR/ROFO/ROFN:**  
1. **Exclusive Relationship & Control Over Opportunities**  
   - The clause establishes that **PFHOF** has the **exclusive** relationship with the NFL, its clubs, and Legends for all **PFHOF and HOFV activities**.  
   - This implies that any business opportunities involving these entities must first go through **PFHOF**, effectively giving it a **right of first negotiation (ROFN)** or **right of first offer (ROFO)** before third parties (like Village Media Company) can engage directly.  

2. **Exception for Investment-Related Communications**  
   - The clause allows **direct communication** with the NFL only for **investment-related matters**, but only through **PFHOF’s President or HOFV’s CEO**.  
   - This suggests that even in investment scenarios, **PFHOF retains a gatekeeping role**, which could function as a **ROFR/ROFO**—requiring PFHOF to be involved before any deal proceeds.  

3. **Village Media Company’s Limited Rights**  
   - The clause permits **Village Media Company** to present opportunities but **only for PFHOF’s approval**.  
   - This resembles a **ROFR/ROFO structure**, where PFHOF has the **first right to accept or reject** any proposed opportunity before it can be pursued independently.  

### **Conclusion:**  
While the clause does not explicitly label these rights as **ROFR/ROFO/ROFN**, it effectively **grants PFHOF priority control** over dealings with the NFL and related entities, functioning similarly to such rights. Any third party (like Village Media Company) must first seek **PFHOF’s approval**, ensuring PFHOF has the **first opportunity** to engage in or block transactions.

Rofr/Rofo/Rofn,d12bc7e9b9,"XSPA shall give prompt written notice to Calm each time it offers, proposes to offer, or has received an offer to enter into any agreement or arrangement under which XSPA or any of its affiliates would sell, offer for sale, market, promote or undertake any similar action with respect to any meditation or sleep digital products or similar products at any Store outside the Territory (each, a ""ROFR Notice"").

Calm shall have thirty (30) business days (the ""ROFR Period"") from receipt of a ROFR Notice to exercise its ROFR with respect to the region and/or Stores described in the ROFR Notice.","The query refers to **ROFR (Right of First Refusal)**, **ROFO (Right of First Offer)**, and **ROFN (Right of First Negotiation)**, which are contractual mechanisms that grant a party preferential rights in certain business transactions. The provided clause explicitly outlines a **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)** in favor of Calm, making it directly relevant to the query. Here’s how the clause aligns with the concepts in the query:

### **1. Right of First Refusal (ROFR)**
- The clause grants Calm a **ROFR**, meaning that if XSPA (or its affiliates) receives an offer or intends to sell/market meditation or sleep digital products in stores outside the agreed Territory, Calm has the **first right to match that offer** before XSPA can proceed with a third party.
- **Key ROFR Elements in the Clause**:
  - **Trigger**: XSPA must issue a **ROFR Notice** to Calm when it receives or proposes an offer for expansion outside the Territory.
  - **Exercise Period**: Calm has **30 business days (ROFR Period)** to decide whether to match the terms.
  - **Binding Effect**: If Calm exercises the ROFR, the parties must amend the agreement to include the new region/stores.
  - **Same Terms Requirement**: If Calm declines, XSPA can proceed with a third party **only on the same terms** originally offered to Calm (or issue a new ROFR Notice if terms change).

### **2. Distinction from ROFO/ROFN**
- **ROFO (Right of First Offer)**: Unlike a ROFR (where the right is triggered by an existing third-party offer), a ROFO requires the seller to offer the opportunity to the ROFO holder **before** seeking third-party offers. This clause is **not a ROFO** because XSPA’s obligation arises only after it has an offer or proposes to offer to a third party.
- **ROFN (Right of First Negotiation)**: A ROFN grants the holder an exclusive negotiation period before the seller engages with others. The clause does **not** include negotiation rights—Calm must accept or reject the existing terms, not negotiate new ones.

### **3. Relevance to Query**
The clause is a **classic ROFR provision** (not ROFO or ROFN) because:
- It is **reactive** (triggered by an existing or proposed third-party offer).
- It allows Calm to **match the terms** rather than negotiate them.
- It includes safeguards (e.g., same terms requirement, re-notification if terms change).

### **Conclusion**
This clause is a **ROFR** mechanism, giving Calm the right to preempt third-party deals under defined conditions. It does not function as a ROFO or ROFN, as it lacks the proactive offering or exclusive negotiation features of those rights.",5
Change Of Control,03c6d7e0ef,"For purposes of this Agreement, ""Change in Control"" means a merger or consolidation of the party with, or any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of such party to, any other person, corporation or entity, unless as a result of such merger, consolidation or sale of assets the holders of such party\'s voting securities prior thereto hold at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the surviving or successor corporation after such transaction.","The **""Change of Control""** clause defines the circumstances under which a significant ownership or structural change in a party (e.g., a company) would trigger legal consequences under the agreement.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Definition of Triggering Events** – The clause specifies that a **merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all assets** constitutes a ""Change in Control,"" unless the original owners retain **at least 50% of voting power** in the surviving entity.  
   - This ensures clarity on when contractual rights (e.g., termination, adjustment, or consent requirements) may be activated.  

2. **Protection Against Unwanted Takeovers** – By requiring that original shareholders retain majority control to avoid a ""Change in Control,"" the clause safeguards against hostile takeovers or shifts in corporate governance that could disrupt contractual relationships.  

3. **Contractual Implications** – Many agreements (e.g., employment, loans, partnerships) include **change-of-control provisions** that may:  
   - Allow termination/renegotiation of the contract.  
   - Trigger payouts (e.g., ""golden parachute"" clauses).  
   - Require consent from the other party before proceeding.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
This clause ensures that significant corporate restructuring does not occur without contractual safeguards, protecting stakeholders from unforeseen disruptions. If a transaction meets the defined criteria, it may activate rights or obligations under the agreement.

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Definition of Triggering Events** – The clause specifies that a **merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all assets** constitutes a ""Change in Control,"" unless the original owners retain **at least 50% of voting power** post-transaction.  
   - This ensures clarity on when key contractual protections (e.g., termination rights, payment triggers, or consent requirements) may apply.  

2. **Protection Against Hostile Takeovers** – By requiring that the original owners retain majority control (50%+ voting power) to avoid a ""Change in Control,"" the clause safeguards against unwanted shifts in corporate governance.  

3. **Contractual Implications** – Many agreements (e.g., employment contracts, loans, or partnership agreements) include **change-of-control provisions** that may:  
   - Allow termination or renegotiation of terms.  
   - Trigger accelerated payments (e.g., debt repayment or executive severance).  
   - Require consent from counterparties before proceeding with the transaction.  

### **Why It Matters for the Query:**  
If a party is considering a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, this clause determines whether the transaction will be classified as a ""Change in Control,"" potentially activating contractual safeguards or obligations. Legal and financial teams must assess this definition to ensure compliance and anticipate consequences.

Change Of Control,408907bf9f,"[ * ] expected to experience, or [ * ] is experiencing, such Change of Control shall notify [ * ] in writing of this before or within [ * ] after the Change of Control. For the avoidance of doubt, if following [ * ] there is a transfer of shareholding or interests in Distributor to any existing or new shareholder(s) which results in any person or persons subsequently gaining Control of Distributor, then Google may exercise its right to terminate in accordance with this clause 5.4.

In this Clause the term ""Control"" shall mean the possession by any person(s) directly or indirectly of the power to direct or cause the direction of another person and ""Change of Control"" is to be construed accordingly. For the avoidance of doubt, a Change of Control shall be deemed an assignment hereunder unless [ * ] does not exercise its [ * ].","This clause is highly relevant to the query **""Change of Control""** as it defines the rights and obligations of the parties (likely **Google** and a **Distributor**) in the event of a change in the ownership or control of the Distributor. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Notification Requirement**  
- The clause requires the party undergoing a **Change of Control** (likely the Distributor) to notify the other party (**Google**) **before or within a specified period** after the event.  
- This ensures transparency and allows Google to assess whether the change affects its contractual relationship.

### **2. Definition of ""Change of Control""**  
- **""Control""** is defined as the power to direct another entity, whether directly or indirectly.  
- A **Change of Control** occurs when a new person or group gains this power (e.g., through a share transfer, merger, or acquisition).  
- The clause clarifies that even transfers to **existing or new shareholders** that result in a new controlling party trigger this provision.

### **3. Termination Rights**  
- **Google has the right to terminate the agreement immediately** upon a Change of Control of the Distributor.  
- This protects Google from being forced into a relationship with an unwanted new controlling entity (e.g., a competitor or financially unstable party).  
- The termination right is **at Google’s discretion** (since it says ""may terminate"").  

### **4. Deemed Assignment**  
- A Change of Control is treated as an **assignment** (transfer of rights/obligations) unless Google chooses not to exercise its termination right.  
- Many contracts restrict assignments without consent, so this ensures Google retains control over who it does business with.

### **5. Practical Relevance to the Query**  
- If a **Distributor is acquired or undergoes a major ownership change**, this clause allows Google to **exit the agreement** if it deems the new ownership unfavorable.  
- It also **forces disclosure**, preventing hidden ownership changes that could impact the business relationship.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is a **standard protective measure** in contracts where one party (Google) wants to control who it engages with. It ensures that any **shift in ownership or control** of the Distributor is communicated promptly and gives Google the flexibility to **terminate the agreement if necessary**.

Change Of Control,57189aba97,"A change of control shall be deemed an assignment requiring consent hereunder provided that any transfer or assignment that results in Seller's and Buyer's current common parent, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited, ceasing to control either party shall not require consent of the other party. This Agreement, its rights and obligations, is not assignable or transferable by either Party, in whole or in part, except with the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.","This clause addresses the **""Change of Control""** query by defining how a change in ownership or control of either party (Seller or Buyer) affects their obligations under the agreement. Here’s the relevance to the query:

1. **Change of Control as Assignment**:  
   The clause treats a **change of control** (e.g., acquisition, merger, or significant ownership shift) as an **assignment** of the agreement, which typically requires the other party’s consent.  

2. **Exception for Common Parent**:  
   If both Seller and Buyer are currently controlled by the same parent company (**Reynolds Group Holdings Limited**), a transfer or assignment that results in this common parent **losing control** of either party **does not require consent**. This ensures internal corporate restructuring (within the same group) does not trigger consent obligations.  

3. **General Non-Assignability**:  
   The agreement otherwise prohibits assignment or transfer **without prior written consent**, which cannot be **unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed**. This protects both parties from unwanted third-party involvement.  

### **Key Relevance to ""Change of Control""**  
- It clarifies that a change of control (e.g., a takeover) is treated like an assignment, requiring approval unless it involves the common parent’s loss of control.  
- It balances flexibility (for corporate group restructuring) with protection (preventing uncontrolled transfers to unrelated entities).

Change Of Control,a4721ad55b,"In the event a party undergoes a Change of Control Event as defined in Section 14.5, the other party may terminate the Agreement upon thirty (32) days written notice to the party undergoing the Change of Control.","The **""Change of Control""** clause you provided is relevant to the query because it addresses the rights and obligations of the parties in the event that one party experiences a significant change in ownership or control (as defined in **Section 14.5** of the agreement). Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Definition of Change of Control**  
   - The clause refers to a **""Change of Control Event""** (likely defined in **Section 14.5**), which typically includes scenarios such as mergers, acquisitions, or a transfer of a majority of voting power.  
   - The exact definition is crucial because it determines when this clause is triggered.

2. **Termination Right for the Non-Affected Party**  
   - If one party undergoes such a change, the **other party** (the one not experiencing the change) has the right to **terminate the agreement** by providing **32 days' written notice**.  
   - This protects the non-affected party from being forced into a contractual relationship with an undesired new owner or controlling entity.

3. **Notice Period (32 Days)**  
   - The specified **32-day notice period** allows the party undergoing the change an opportunity to address concerns or negotiate alternatives before termination takes effect.  
   - (Note: The use of **32 days** instead of a more standard **30 days** may be a typo—this should be verified.)

### **Why This Clause Matters in Contracts**  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Ensures that a party is not bound to a contract if the other party is acquired by a competitor or an entity with conflicting interests.  
- **Flexibility**: Provides an exit mechanism without requiring a breach of contract.  
- **Negotiation Leverage**: Can be used to renegotiate terms if a Change of Control occurs.

Anti-Assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates,2c5e257df7,"Except as otherwise provided herein, a Party shall not have the right to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether through a merger, sale of stock, or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party; except that, either Party shall be permitted, without any need for the other Party's consent, to assign this Agreement (a) in whole or in part to an Affiliate (provided, however, that once such Person is no longer an Affiliate of the assigning Party, such former Affiliate shall assign this Agreement back to the assigning Party), provided that the assigning Party provides the other Party notice of any such assignment provided further that failure to provide such notice of such assignment shall not render such assignment void; or (b) to a Third Party in connection with sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assigning Party's business or assets relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether by Change of Control, merger, sale of assets or otherwise; provided, however, that, with respect to clause (b), (i) any assignment of this Agreement shall be void and have no effect unless and until the assignee assumes the <omitted> obligations of the assigning Party in a written instrument, a copy of which is provided to the other Party; and (ii) any assignment of this Agreement must be accompanied by a simultaneous assignment of the Other Agreements to the same assignee, and the assigning Party's interest in the Purchased Assets to the same assignee unless otherwise agreed by Conformis in advance, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.","This clause is directly relevant to the query regarding an **anti-assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates** because it:  

1. **Prohibits General Assignments Without Consent** – The clause states that neither party can assign its rights or obligations under the agreement without the other party’s prior written consent, except in two specific scenarios.  

2. **Permits Assignment to Affiliates Without Consent, But Requires Notice** – The exception in **subsection (a)** allows a party to assign the agreement to an **Affiliate** without needing the other party’s consent, **but mandates that the assigning party must provide notice** of such assignment.  
   - Importantly, the clause clarifies that **failure to provide notice does not invalidate the assignment** (i.e., the assignment remains legally effective even if notice is not given).  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on an anti-assignment clause where notice is required only for affiliate assignments.  

3. **Contrasts with Assignments to Third Parties** – The clause treats assignments to **non-affiliates (Third Parties)** differently (subsection (b)), requiring stricter conditions (e.g., written assumption of obligations, simultaneous assignment of related agreements). This further emphasizes that the notice requirement applies **only to affiliate assignments**, not third-party transfers.  

### **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
The clause explicitly requires **notice for affiliate assignments** (but not consent) while maintaining stricter restrictions for non-affiliate assignments. This matches the query’s requirement of an anti-assignment provision where notice is mandated only for assignments to affiliates.",5
Anti-Assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates,0d24d19635,"Except as otherwise provided herein, a Party shall not have the right to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether through a merger, sale of stock, or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party; except that, either Party shall be permitted, without any need for the other Party's consent, to assign this Agreement (a) in whole or in part to an Affiliate (provided, however, that once such Person is no longer an Affiliate of the assigning Party, such former Affiliate shall assign this Agreement back to the assigning Party), provided that the assigning Party provides the other Party notice of any such assignment provided further that failure to provide such notice of such assignment shall not render such assignment void; or (b) to a Third Party in connection with sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assigning Party's business or assets relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether by Change of Control, merger, sale of assets or otherwise; provided, however, that, with respect to clause (b), (i) any assignment of this Agreement shall be void and have no effect unless and until the assignee assumes the<omitted>obligations of the assigning Party in a written instrument, a copy of which is provided to the other Party; and (ii) any assignment of this Agreement must be accompanied by a simultaneous assignment of the Other Agreements to the same assignee, and the assigning Party's interest in the Purchased Assets to the same assignee unless otherwise agreed by Conformis in advance, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.","This anti-assignment clause is directly relevant to the query because it **explicitly requires notice only for assignments to affiliates**, while imposing stricter conditions (like prior consent or additional requirements) for other types of assignments. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **General Prohibition on Assignment**  
   The clause starts by prohibiting any assignment of rights/obligations without the other party’s prior written consent, which is typical in anti-assignment clauses.

2. **Exception for Affiliates (Notice-Only Requirement)**  
   - The clause allows assignment to an **Affiliate** *without consent*, but **requires the assigning party to notify the other party** of such assignment.  
   - The notice is not a condition for validity—failure to notify does **not** void the assignment. This aligns with the query’s focus on a notice-only requirement for affiliate assignments.  
   - The clause also ensures the assignment is temporary: if the affiliate ceases to qualify as such, the agreement must be reassigned to the original party.

3. **Stricter Rules for Third-Party Assignments**  
   - Assignments to third parties (e.g., in a sale of business) are subject to additional hurdles (e.g., written assumption of obligations, simultaneous assignment of related agreements).  
   - Unlike affiliate assignments, these assignments are **void** unless conditions are met, showing a clear distinction in treatment.

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause specifically addresses the scenario where **only affiliate assignments require notice** (but not consent), while other assignments face stricter controls. This matches the query’s request for an anti-assignment clause with a notice-only requirement for affiliates. The clause also clarifies that the notice is procedural (non-mandatory for validity), which may be a nuanced but important detail for the user.",5
Anti-Assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates,437f5ab14e,"Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 11.1 shall be void. Neither this Agreement nor any interest hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as follows: (a) such Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, provided that the assignee shall expressly agree to be bound by such Party's obligations under this Agreement and that such Party shall remain liable for all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (b) either Party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a Third Party in connection with a permitted assignment or other permitted transfer of the License Agreement. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1.","The query asks for an **anti-assignment clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates**. Here’s how the provided clause aligns with the query:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **General Anti-Assignment Rule**:  
   - The clause states that assignments without prior written consent are **void**, establishing a strict default prohibition.

2. **Exception for Affiliates (Subsection (a))**:  
   - A party may assign its rights/obligations to an **Affiliate** without consent, provided:  
     - The affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms.  
     - The assigning party remains liable.  
   - **Critically, this exception does not explicitly require notice** (though notice may be implied by the final sentence).

3. **Exception for Third-Party Transfers (Subsection (b))**:  
   - Permits assignment to a **Third Party** only if tied to a permitted transfer under the **License Agreement** (a separate contract).  
   - This requires compliance with another agreement, not just notice.

4. **Notice Requirement (Final Sentence)**:  
   - **""Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under this Section 11.1.""**  
   - This applies to **all assignments** under the section, including those to affiliates (subsection (a)) and third parties (subsection (b)).  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **allows affiliate assignments without consent** but still **requires notice** (final sentence).  
- For third-party assignments, additional conditions (e.g., linkage to the License Agreement) apply, going beyond mere notice.  
- Thus, the clause **prioritizes notice for affiliate assignments** while imposing stricter rules for non-affiliate transfers.  

### Suggested Refinement for Clarity:  
If the goal is to **explicitly limit notice to affiliate assignments only**, the clause could be revised to:  
> *""Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 11.1 shall be void. Neither this Agreement nor any interest hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that a Party may assign its rights and obligations to an Affiliate without consent, provided that (i) the assignee agrees in writing to be bound hereby, (ii) the assigning Party remains liable, and (iii) the assigning Party notifies the other Party promptly after such assignment. Assignments to Third Parties require prior written consent unless permitted under the License Agreement.""*  

This would **narrow the notice requirement exclusively to affiliate assignments**, fully aligning with the query.

Anti-Assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates,ca024bb5a6,"Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 11.1 shall be void.<omitted>Neither this Agreement nor any interest hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as follows: (a) such Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, provided that the assignee shall expressly agree to be bound by such Party's obligations under this Agreement and that such Party shall remain liable for all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (b) either Party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a Third Party in connection with a permitted assignment or other permitted transfer of the License Agreement. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1.","The query specifically asks for an **anti-assignment clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates**. Here’s how the provided clause aligns with the query:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **General Anti-Assignment Rule**:  
   - The clause states that assignments without prior written consent are void, establishing a default prohibition on transfers.  

2. **Exception for Affiliates (Subsection (a))**:  
   - A party may assign its rights/obligations to an **Affiliate** without consent, provided:  
     - The affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms.  
     - The original party remains liable.  
   - **Notice Requirement**: The last sentence explicitly requires **prompt notice** to the other party for any assignment/transfer under Section 11.1, including affiliate assignments.  

3. **Other Exceptions (Subsection (b))**:  
   - Assignments to **Third Parties** are permitted only in connection with a transfer of the License Agreement (a separate, ""permitted"" scenario).  
   - Notice is also required here, but this is **not the focus of the query**.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause **matches the request** because:  
- It **allows affiliate assignments without consent** (only requiring the affiliate to assume obligations and the original party to remain liable).  
- It **explicitly mandates notice** for such assignments (""Each Party shall promptly notify..."").  
- The notice requirement applies broadly to ""any assignment or transfer"" under Section 11.1, which includes affiliate assignments under subsection (a).  

### Why It Fits:  
The query seeks a clause where:  
1. Affiliate assignments are permitted without consent.  
2. Notice is required for affiliate assignments.  
3. Other assignments (e.g., to third parties) may have additional conditions (here, tied to the License Agreement).  

This clause satisfies all three criteria, with the notice requirement covering affiliate assignments as the primary focus.  

**Note**: The clause goes beyond the query by also addressing third-party assignments, but its core mechanism for affiliates aligns perfectly with the request.",5
Anti-Assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates,922bd67793,"Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be void. This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party unless the assignee expressly assumes in writing the obligations of the assignor hereunder. Network Affiliate may not assign or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any of its rights under this Agreement or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any third party without NCM's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.","The query asks for an **anti-assignment clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates**. The provided clause partially aligns with this requirement but has broader restrictions. Here’s the relevance and analysis:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **General Anti-Assignment Provision**  
   - The clause voids any assignment made in violation of its terms.  
   - It requires **all assignees** (not just affiliates) to assume the assignor’s obligations in writing.  

2. **Specific Restriction on Network Affiliate**  
   - The clause explicitly addresses assignments by a **""Network Affiliate""** (likely an affiliate of one of the parties).  
   - It prohibits the Network Affiliate from assigning rights or delegating duties **without prior written consent** from NCM (the other party).  
   - Consent cannot be ""unreasonably withheld,"" implying a notice-and-approval process for affiliate assignments.  

3. **Does It Fully Match the Query?**  
   - The clause **requires consent (not just notice)** for affiliate assignments, which is stricter than a mere notice requirement.  
   - It also applies the consent requirement **only to the ""Network Affiliate""** (not all affiliates of either party).  
   - The general anti-assignment rule applies to **all assignments**, not just those involving affiliates.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause is **partially relevant** to the query because:  
- It specifically regulates assignments by a defined affiliate (Network Affiliate) and requires consent (not just notice).  
- However, it does not impose a **notice-only** requirement for affiliates broadly; instead, it mandates **consent** for a specific affiliate.  

If the goal is a clause where **any affiliate assignment merely requires notice** (not consent), this clause would need modification to:  
1. Remove the consent requirement for affiliates.  
2. Replace it with a notice obligation (e.g., ""Party A must provide written notice to Party B before assigning to an affiliate"").  
3. Clarify whether the notice applies to all affiliates or only certain categories.

Revenue/Profit Sharing,b6f92d635c,Revenue Share as specified in this CONTENT DISTRIBUTION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT.<omitted>The revenue share for the Program is stated in Exhibit B.,"The clause you provided is relevant to the query about **Revenue/Profit Sharing** in the following ways:  

1. **Reference to Revenue Share Terms** – The clause confirms that revenue sharing is addressed in the agreement, specifically under the **""CONTENT DISTRIBUTION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT""** section. This means the parties have agreed on how revenue (or profit) will be divided.  

2. **Exhibit B as the Governing Document** – The clause directs the reader to **Exhibit B** for the exact revenue share percentages or structure. This implies that the financial split (e.g., 70/30, 50/50, or another arrangement) is detailed separately in an attached exhibit rather than in the main body of the agreement.  

3. **Clarity on Profit Distribution** – By stating that the revenue share is ""specified"" and ""stated in Exhibit B,"" the clause ensures that there is no ambiguity—the parties must refer to Exhibit B to understand their respective entitlements.  

### **Why This Matters for Revenue/Profit Sharing**  
- If the query is about how revenue or profits are divided between the parties, this clause confirms that the agreement has a defined mechanism.  
- It highlights the importance of reviewing **Exhibit B** to fully understand the financial terms.  
- If Exhibit B is missing or unclear, it could lead to disputes, so proper cross-referencing is essential.

### Key Revenue/Profit Sharing Provisions:
1. **Equal Revenue Sharing for Certain Activities**  
   - The parties will share **equally** all revenue from:  
     - Listing paper or local coupons in the Co-Branded Application.  
     - **Untargeted Offers** displayed in the Co-Branded Application (revenue calculated per Section 2.a).  
     - Sales of Untargeted Offers specifically for the Co-Branded Application.  

2. **Exclusions from Equal Sharing**  
   - Revenue from **Sponsorship tiles** is retained by the party to whom they are allocated (no sharing).  
   - Revenue from Untargeted Offers placed **outside** the Co-Branded Application is not subject to equal sharing.  

3. **Net Revenue Sharing for Specific Offers**  
   - For Untargeted Offers, net revenue (gross revenue minus third-party serving costs, capped at $0.01 per email) is shared equally.  
   - Excite@Home pays e-centives a **percentage of net revenue** (after deducting purchase price and capped sales costs) from sales of e-centives packages.  

4. **Adjustments for Excess Deliveries**  
   - If Excite@Home delivers more than a threshold of user data records, e-centives pays Excite@Home a **percentage of net revenue** (after deducting third-party commissions) from offers sent to those excess users.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
This clause directly addresses **how revenue and profits are divided** between the parties, covering:  
- **What is shared equally**: Certain Co-Branded Application revenues.  
- **What is excluded**: Sponsorship tiles and external placements.  
- **How net revenue is calculated**: Deductions for costs/commissions before sharing.  
- **Variable sharing terms**: Percentage-based splits for specific scenarios (e.g., e-centives packages, excess user data).

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Revenue Sharing Mechanism**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that net revenue will be split **equally (50/50)** between TKCI and SIC. This answers the core question of how profits/revenue will be shared.

2. **Sources of Revenue Generation**:  
   - It clarifies the roles of each party in generating revenue:  
     - **SIC** contributes through **business concepts, plans, opportunities, and third-party contracts**.  
     - **TKCI** provides **advisory/management services and capital resources** to operationalize these concepts.  
   - This justifies the equal split by linking each party’s contributions to the revenue creation process.

3. **Scope of Revenue Covered**:  
   - The clause specifies that the sharing applies to **net revenue from business operations created by the Holding Company for the alliance**, ensuring clarity on what revenue streams are included (e.g., excluding unrelated revenue).

4. **Legal Intent**:  
   - By detailing the rationale behind the 50/50 split (each party’s unique value-add), the clause mitigates potential disputes over fairness or expectations.

   - From the **11th product onward**, the Distributor’s share increases to **15%**, and Hydraspin’s decreases to **85%**.  
   - This incentivizes the Distributor to sell more products by offering a higher revenue share after a threshold is met.

2. **Negotiation Flexibility**:  
   - The clause allows for **custom agreements** between Hydraspin and the Distributor for specific installations.  
   - If a separate written agreement exists, its terms **override** the default percentages outlined here.

1. **Types of Revenue Sharing**  
   - The clause specifies two forms of revenue sharing:  
     - **Affiliate Transactional Share**: 15% of the Network's **Transactional Revenue** (e.g., revenue from transactions like pay-per-view, subscriptions, or other user-paid services).  
     - **Affiliate Advertising Share**: A portion (15%) of the Network's **Advertising Revenue**, adjusted by a formula based on the Affiliate's subscriber reach in their designated market area (DMA).  

2. **Payment Timing**  
   - Payments begin with the calendar quarter starting **April 1, 2006**, and continue quarterly for the duration of the agreement (""the Term"").  

3. **Exclusivity and Scope**  
   - The Network retains **exclusive rights** to sell advertising on the Service (except for local advertising), but shares a defined portion of advertising revenue with the Affiliate.  
   - The Affiliate's share of advertising revenue is **proportional** to their subscriber base relative to the Network's total subscriber footprint.  

4. **Key Definitions**  
   - **Affiliate Transactional Share**: Fixed 15% of transactional revenue.  
   - **Affiliate Advertising Share**: 15% of advertising revenue, weighted by the Affiliate's DMA subscriber share.  

### Why This Matters for the Query  
The clause answers how revenue/profits are split:  
- **Transactional Revenue**: Straight 15% cut to the Affiliate.  
- **Advertising Revenue**: 15% of total ad revenue, scaled by the Affiliate's market penetration.  
- **Transparency**: Clear formulas and timing ensure predictability for both parties.  

This structure ensures the Affiliate is compensated fairly based on their contribution to the Network's revenue streams.",5

1. **Defines the Minimum Purchase Obligation** – The clause explicitly states that **MA (likely the buyer or purchasing party)** must buy at least **100 Units** in total during the first six months of the agreement. This sets a clear **minimum volume commitment** that MA must fulfill.

2. **Specifies Timeframe** – The commitment is tied to a **fixed period (first six months)**, ensuring that the buyer cannot delay or avoid the obligation beyond this window.

3. **Geographical Scope** – The commitment applies **""within the Territory""**, meaning purchases outside this defined region may not count toward the minimum.

4. **Enforceability** – By formalizing this commitment in the contract, the seller has legal recourse if MA fails to meet the **100-unit threshold**, potentially triggering penalties, termination rights, or other remedies.

### Why This Matters for ""Minimum Commitment"":
- **Buyer’s Obligation:** Ensures MA does not underperform in purchasing.  
- **Seller’s Protection:** Guarantees a baseline revenue or volume from MA.  
- **Performance Metric:** Provides a measurable benchmark for compliance.

Here’s a breakdown of its key aspects:

### 1. **Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment**  
   - Ginkgo is obligated to meet annual minimum spending targets (""Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment"") for each **Contract Year** (Years 1–7), as specified in **Table 7.2.2**.  
   - The total minimum commitment across all years is **$150 million**, but this escalates to **$109 million in Year 7** unless BLI achieves a milestone (completing [***] Workflows in the first [***] years), in which case the Year 7 commitment reverts to $150 million.  

### 2. **Enforcement and Adjustments**  
   - **Binding Nature**: The minimum commitments for certain years (e.g., Years [***]) are explicitly stated as binding.  
   - **Breach Remedy**: If BLI materially breaches its supply obligations, Ginkgo can **reduce future minimum commitments** (instead of terminating the agreement) via mutual good-faith negotiation.  
   - **Termination Triggers**: If Ginkgo fails to meet a yearly minimum, BLI may lift restrictions on competing with Ginkgo (e.g., providing services to [***]), but must notify Ginkgo within [***] days of the shortfall.  

### 3. **Flexibility and Conditions**  
   - **Credits/Offsets**: Ginkgo’s spending includes credits/offsets (e.g., upfront payments).  
   - **Milestone Adjustments**: The $109M/$150M Year 7 commitment hinges on BLI’s performance ([***] Workflows completed).  
   - **Partial Satisfaction**: Some obligations (e.g., initial [***] purchase) can partially fulfill commitments.  

### **Why This Matters for ""Minimum Commitment""**  
The clause answers:  
- **What** the minimum spend is per year and in total.  
- **How** it can be adjusted (breach, milestones, mutual agreement).  
- **Consequences** of non-compliance (loss of exclusivity, renegotiation rights).

   - **Year 3 Adjustment**: The commitment increases in Year 3 based on email volume growth (50% of the difference between Year 1 and Year 2 email sends), capped at $500,000. This ties the minimum payment to performance metrics.  

### 2. **Operational Commitments**  
   - **Training Requirements**: HSNS must ensure:  
     - At least **2 pre-sales technical staff** complete training in the first 6 months.  
     - At least **5 sales staff** complete sales/marketing training in the same period.  
   These ensure HSNS has the capability to meet its sell-through obligations.  

### **Why It Answers the Query**  
The clause defines the **minimum thresholds** (both financial and operational) that HSNS must meet, addressing the core question about the nature and scope of its commitments under the agreement. The specifics (e.g., payment structure, performance-linked adjustments, and training mandates) clarify how the ""Minimum Commitment"" is enforced and measured.

Minimum Commitment,f71c09085e,"Any one or more of the following events shall constitute a ""Maintenance Event of Default"" under this Agreement:<omitted>(d) if Investor shall, at any time, fail to have committed capital in an aggregate minimum amount equal to $5,000,000 less the sum of all Required Capital Contributions (if any) actually made by the Investor during the term of this Agreement, as determined based on the most recent information made available by the Investor to the Agent pursuant to Section 20 below; The Investor agrees to deliver to the Agent, from time to time, promptly following Agent's request therefor, a sworn affidavit or other evidence reasonably acceptable to the Agent substantiating that the Investor has committed capital in an aggregate minimum amount equal to $5,000,000 less the sum of all Required Capital Contributions (if any) actually made by the Investor during the term of this Agreement.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **""Minimum Commitment""** because it establishes the Investor's obligation to maintain a minimum level of committed capital throughout the term of the agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Minimum Commitment Requirement**:  
   The clause specifies that the Investor must at all times maintain **committed capital** of at least **$5,000,000**, adjusted for any **Required Capital Contributions** already made. This ensures the Investor has sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations under the agreement.

2. **Consequence of Failure (Event of Default)**:  
   If the Investor fails to meet this minimum commitment, it constitutes a **""Maintenance Event of Default""**, which could trigger remedies or penalties under the agreement (e.g., termination, forfeiture of rights, or other enforcement actions).

3. **Verification Mechanism**:  
   The Investor must provide **sworn affidavits or other evidence** to the Agent upon request to prove compliance with the minimum commitment. This ensures transparency and allows the Agent to monitor the Investor’s financial capacity.

### Key Takeaways for the Query:
- The clause enforces a **financial floor** ($5M minus contributions) to protect the other party (likely a fund or project) from undercapitalization risks.  
- It ties the **""Minimum Commitment""** directly to contractual consequences (default) and verification procedures.  
- The adjustment for **Required Capital Contributions** ensures the obligation reflects actual remaining commitments, not just the initial $5M.  

In summary, this clause defines and enforces the **minimum financial commitment** expected from the Investor, with mechanisms to ensure compliance and consequences for non-compliance.",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,838dcfbc11,"Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may transfer or assign its rights under this IP Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, on condition that it provides the <omitted> other Party with notice of the transfer or assignment.","This clause is directly relevant to the **IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer** query because it addresses the conditions under which a party can transfer or assign its intellectual property (IP) rights under the agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Scope of Transfer/Assignment**:  
   The clause permits a party to transfer or assign its IP rights **only** in specific corporate scenarios:  
   - A **merger** (combining with another entity).  
   - An **acquisition** (being bought by another entity).  
   - A **sale of all or substantially all assets** (liquidating or restructuring the business).  

   This ensures IP rights cannot be arbitrarily transferred outside these major structural changes.

2. **Condition for Transfer**:  
   The transferring party must **notify the other party** (the counterparty to the agreement) of the assignment or transfer. This maintains transparency and allows the non-transferring party to track ownership changes affecting their rights or obligations.

3. **Alignment with IP Ownership Concerns**:  
   The clause balances flexibility (allowing IP transfers in legitimate business reorganizations) with control (requiring notice to prevent undisclosed assignments). It safeguards both parties by:  
   - Preventing unauthorized transfers that could disrupt IP ownership.  
   - Ensuring continuity of rights even after corporate changes.  

In summary, this clause directly answers the query by defining **when and how IP ownership can be reassigned**, which is critical for risk management and contractual clarity in IP agreements.",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,adb92d0221,"If and to the extent that, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any of the Assigned IP cannot be assigned as provided in Section 2.1(b)(i), (A) the Seller irrevocably agrees to (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) assign and transfer, and the Seller hereby assigns and transfers (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to assign and transfer) to the Purchaser Assignees all rights (including all economic and commercialization rights) that can be assigned pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i) to the fullest extent permissible, and (B) the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser Assignees, and hereby agrees to cause the other Seller Parties to grant to the Purchaser Assignees, an unlimited, exclusive, irrevocable, assignable, transferable, sublicenseable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, fully-paid up license to use, exploit, and commercialize in any manner now known or in the future discovered and for whatever purpose, any and all rights to Assigned IP that cannot be assigned as contemplated by Section 2.1(b)(i).","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer** because it addresses a critical scenario where full legal ownership of intellectual property (IP) cannot be transferred due to jurisdictional or other legal constraints. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Fallback Mechanism for IP Transfer**  
   - The clause anticipates situations where certain IP rights (the ""Assigned IP"") cannot be legally assigned outright under the laws of a jurisdiction (e.g., moral rights, certain statutory rights, or local IP restrictions).  
   - It ensures the **Purchaser Assignees** still obtain maximum possible control over the IP by:  
     - **Assigning transferable rights** (economic/commercialization rights) to the fullest extent permissible (Part A).  
     - **Granting a comprehensive license** for any non-assignable rights (Part B).  

2. **Comprehensive License as a Backup**  
   - If ownership cannot be transferred, the Seller grants an **irrevocable, exclusive, perpetual, and royalty-free license** covering all residual rights (e.g., use, exploitation, commercialization).  
   - The license terms are broad (global, sublicensable, etc.) to mimic ownership as closely as possible.  

3. **Seller Obligations**  
   - The Seller commits to binding **itself and related parties** (""Seller Parties"") to these terms, ensuring no gaps in the transfer/license chain.  

### Why It Matters for the Query:  
This clause ensures **no IP rights remain with the Seller unintentionally**, addressing legal uncertainties while maximizing the Purchaser’s control. It is a standard but critical provision in IP assignment agreements to mitigate jurisdictional risks and ensure enforceability.  

**Practical Impact**: Even if the law prevents an outright assignment, the Purchaser retains all practical benefits of ownership through the license, safeguarding commercialization and future transfers.  

Would you like any specific terms (e.g., ""irrevocable,"" ""perpetual"") clarified further?",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,b482fa8daf,"This IP Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but will not be assignable or delegable by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any attempted transfer in contravention of this Section 9.3 shall be null and void.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer** because it governs the conditions under which the rights and obligations under the IP Agreement can be transferred to another party. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Binding Effect on Successors and Assigns**  
   - The clause ensures that the agreement remains enforceable not just between the original parties but also their **successors (e.g., heirs, merged entities)** and **permitted assigns (approved transferees)**. This is critical for IP ownership continuity, especially in cases like corporate reorganizations or acquisitions.

2. **Restriction on Unauthorized Assignment/Delegation**  
   - A party cannot **assign (transfer rights)** or **delegate (transfer obligations)** under the agreement without the **prior written consent** of the other party. This protects both parties from unwanted third-party involvement in IP ownership or control.

3. **Consequence of Violation**  
   - Any attempted transfer without consent is declared **""null and void""**, meaning it has no legal effect. This safeguards against unauthorized transfers of IP rights, ensuring compliance with the agreed terms.

### Why It Matters for IP Ownership Transfer:  
- **Control Over IP Rights**: Prevents one party from unilaterally transferring IP to a competitor or unrelated entity.  
- **Legal Certainty**: Ensures any valid transfer requires mutual agreement, reducing disputes over ownership.  
- **Enforceability**: Reinforces that breaches of this clause will not be recognized, protecting the original parties' interests.  

In summary, this clause directly addresses the **conditions and limitations** for transferring IP ownership or rights under the agreement, making it a key provision for IP-related contracts.",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,064fcaf0c7,"If a Seller Party assigns or transfers any Licensed IP, the Seller shall (or shall cause the applicable Seller Party to) expressly condition such assignment or transfer on the express acknowledgement and agreement of the assignee or transferee that all such Licensed IP is bound by the license grants set forth herein.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Conditional Assignment/Transfer of Licensed IP**  
   - If the **Seller Party** assigns or transfers any **Licensed IP**, the assignee/transferee must explicitly acknowledge that the IP remains subject to the license grants in the agreement.  
   - Similarly, if the **Purchaser** assigns or transfers **IP licensed to the Seller Parties**, the new owner must agree that the Seller Parties’ license rights continue.  
   - **Relevance**: Ensures that license rights survive any transfer, protecting both parties’ interests.

### 2. **Restrictions on Assignment of the Agreement**  
   - Neither party can assign the **entire IP Agreement** or any of its rights/obligations without the other party’s **prior written consent** (otherwise, the assignment is void).  
   - **Relevance**: Prevents unauthorized transfers that could disrupt the contractual balance.

### 3. **Permitted Assignments Without Consent**  
   - After the **Initial Closing Date**, assignments are allowed **without consent but with prior notice** in specific cases, such as:  
     - Transfers to **Affiliates** (e.g., subsidiaries).  
     - **Lenders** (for collateral security).  
     - **Successors** in mergers/sales of substantially all assets.  
     - **Corporate reorganizations** (if ultimate ownership remains unchanged).  
   - **Relevance**: Provides flexibility for legitimate business restructuring while ensuring transparency.

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The clause ensures that **IP licenses persist** even after assignment/transfer, safeguarding both parties’ rights.  
- It **restricts arbitrary assignments** but allows structured exceptions (e.g., mergers, security interests).  
- It balances **control** (consent requirements) with **practicality** (permitted transfers for business needs).  

This directly addresses concerns about **IP ownership continuity and licensing obligations** during transfers, which is central to the query.",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,911509cfdb,"To the extent that the Company IP does not vest automatically in the Company the Executive hereby assigns all right, title and interest in the Company IP to the Company with full title guarantee by way of a present assignment of all future rights and shall otherwise hold them on trust for the Company.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer** as it ensures that all intellectual property (IP) created by the Executive in connection with their work for the Company is legally transferred to the Company, even if it does not automatically vest in the Company by default. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Automatic Vesting Fallback**:  
   - Some IP rights (e.g., copyright in certain jurisdictions) may automatically belong to the creator (the Executive) unless otherwise agreed. This clause addresses situations where IP does **not** automatically vest in the Company.

2. **Explicit Assignment**:  
   - The Executive **assigns all right, title, and interest** in the Company IP to the Company, ensuring a clear transfer of ownership. This includes future rights (e.g., IP not yet created at the time of signing).

3. **Full Title Guarantee**:  
   - The assignment is made with ""full title guarantee,"" meaning the Executive warrants they have the legal right to transfer the IP and that it is free from undisclosed encumbrances.

4. **Trust Mechanism**:  
   - If the IP does not immediately transfer (e.g., due to jurisdictional requirements), the Executive agrees to **hold it on trust** for the Company, preventing any claim of personal ownership.

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- **Clarity**: Ensures no ambiguity about IP ownership, protecting the Company’s proprietary assets.  
- **Future-Proofing**: Covers both existing and future IP, avoiding gaps in ownership.  
- **Enforceability**: The combination of assignment and trust provisions strengthens the Company’s legal position globally, especially in jurisdictions where automatic vesting may not apply.  

This clause is a robust safeguard for the Company’s IP rights, addressing potential loopholes in ownership transfer.",5
Joint IP Ownership,ae6340432d,"In the event that any Development IP is jointly invented by the Parties in accordance with applicable intellectual property laws, then the ownership of such Development IP that has been jointly invented shall be co-owned by the Parties in accordance with such applicable intellectual property laws; provided, however, that neither Party shall have any duty or obligation to account to the other for any use or exploitation of such jointly invented Development IP and as between the Parties, each Party shall be entitled to retain any and all benefit, financial or otherwise, derived by such Party from such jointly invented Development IP.","This clause directly addresses the query on **Joint IP Ownership** by outlining the rights and obligations of the parties when intellectual property (IP) is jointly invented during the course of their collaboration. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

1. **Definition of Joint Ownership**:  
   The clause confirms that if Development IP is jointly invented under applicable IP laws, the parties will **co-own** it. This establishes the legal framework for shared ownership, which is central to the query.

2. **No Duty to Account**:  
   It clarifies that neither party is required to **account to the other** (e.g., share profits or royalties) for their use or commercialization of the jointly owned IP. This is a critical aspect of joint ownership, as it removes potential disputes over financial obligations.

3. **Unrestricted Exploitation Rights**:  
   Each party retains the right to **freely use and benefit** from the jointly invented IP without owing the other party compensation. This is a permissive approach that avoids restrictions on commercialization, which is often a key concern in joint IP arrangements.

4. **Alignment with Applicable IP Laws**:  
   The clause defers to **local intellectual property laws** to determine joint inventorship and ownership, ensuring compliance with jurisdictional requirements.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The query seeks clarity on how joint IP ownership is handled, and this clause provides a clear answer:  
- Co-ownership is automatic for jointly invented IP.  
- No financial or reporting obligations exist between parties.  
- Each party can independently exploit the IP for its own benefit.  

This structure avoids conflicts over licensing or revenue-sharing while ensuring both parties retain full rights to the jointly owned IP. However, it may not suit collaborations where shared profits or control are desired (e.g., in revenue-generating partnerships).

Here’s how it relates to the query:  

1. **Ownership Structure**:  
   - The clause confirms that Joint IP (defined as ""Improved Conformis Background IP"" and ""KIB Product IP"") is **jointly owned** by both parties, with each holding an **undivided one-half interest**.  
   - It mandates that each party ensures its employees/agents assign their rights to enable this joint ownership (e.g., through assignments or documentation).  

2. **Assignment Obligations**:  
   - Parties must proactively secure assignments from their employees/consultants to vest ownership in Joint IP.  
   - They must also cooperate to **perfect the other party’s 50% interest** (e.g., by executing additional documents if requested).  

3. **Usage and Licensing Rights**:  
   - **No restrictions**: Either party (or its affiliates) may freely use the Joint IP without consent or accounting to the other.  
   - **Licensing to third parties**:  
     - **Conformis** may license Joint IP **outside the ""Buyer Field""** (a defined scope, likely tied to Stryker’s exclusive rights).  
     - **Stryker** may license Joint IP **within the ""Buyer Field""** (its designated area of use).  
   - External licenses (except for Conformis’ licenses of Improved Background IP) must comply with **Section 4.3(c)** of the APA (likely addressing revenue sharing or other terms).  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
This clause comprehensively governs:  
- How Joint IP is **owned** (50/50 split).  
- How ownership is **secured** (assignments/paperwork).  
- How parties may **exploit** the IP (usage/licensing rights).  
- Any **limitations** (e.g., field-specific licensing, compliance with other agreement sections).  

It ensures clarity on rights and obligations while allowing flexibility for commercialization within defined boundaries.

Joint IP Ownership,a1b6f59589,"Investor shall own all right, title and interest in any Improvement made jointly by Company and Investor (""Joint Improvements"") during the term of this IP Agreement, and Company agrees to and hereby does assign to Investor any right, title and interest it may otherwise have in any Joint Improvement.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **Joint IP Ownership** as it defines the ownership rights and assignment obligations concerning improvements made collaboratively by the Company and the Investor (""Joint Improvements""). Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Ownership Allocation**:  
   The clause states that the **Investor** will own **all right, title, and interest** in any Joint Improvement, overriding any default joint ownership principles that might otherwise apply (e.g., equal shares under common law). This ensures the Investor has exclusive control over the IP.

2. **Assignment Obligation**:  
   The Company **explicitly assigns** its potential rights in Joint Improvements to the Investor, eliminating ambiguity or future disputes over ownership. This is a proactive measure to ensure the Investor’s sole ownership is legally enforceable.

3. **Scope of Application**:  
   The clause applies only to improvements made **during the term of the IP Agreement** and those created **jointly** by both parties. It does not address independently developed IP or pre-existing rights.

4. **Implications for the Company**:  
   The Company relinquishes all claims to Joint Improvements, which could limit its ability to use or commercialize them unless otherwise negotiated (e.g., through a license-back provision). This is critical for the Company to understand when entering the agreement.

5. **Investor Protection**:  
   The clause prioritizes the Investor’s interests, ensuring it retains full IP rights to collaborative developments, which is typical in investment agreements where the Investor funds R&D or innovation efforts.

**Why It Matters for the Query**:  
The clause clarifies how joint contributions to IP are treated, avoiding default joint ownership rules that might require profit-sharing or mutual consent for exploitation. It aligns with scenarios where one party (the Investor) seeks to secure IP rights as a return on investment, while the other (the Company) accepts restricted rights in exchange for funding or collaboration.  

**Potential Considerations**:  
- If the Company wishes to retain any rights (e.g., a license), this clause would need modification.  
- The definition of ""Improvement"" should be reviewed to ensure it covers the intended scope (e.g., whether it includes derivative works or minor modifications).  

In summary, this clause is a **one-sided joint IP ownership provision** favoring the Investor, which is common in venture or R&D agreements but may require balancing terms elsewhere in the contract.",5
Joint IP Ownership,bd7fd1b70e,"All right, title and interest in and to the Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP (""Joint IP"") shall be owned jointly by the Parties.

1. **Ownership Structure**:  
   - The clause confirms that both parties hold an **undivided one-half interest** in the Joint IP (Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP).  
   - Each party must ensure its employees/agents assign their rights to the Joint IP to facilitate the other party’s co-ownership.  

2. **Assignment & Perfection**:  
   - Parties must proactively secure assignments from employees/consultants to formalize joint ownership.  
   - At the other party’s request, they must execute documents (e.g., assignments) to **perfect** the co-ownership interest.  

3. **Usage & Licensing Rights**:  
   - **Internal Use**: Either party (or its affiliates) may freely use the Joint IP without restrictions.  
   - **External Licensing**:  
     - **Conformis** may license Joint IP to third parties **outside the Buyer Field** (Stryker’s designated area).  
     - **Stryker** may license Joint IP **within the Buyer Field**.  
   - No consent, accounting, or notice is required for such licenses, except for external licenses of Improved Conformis Background IP, which must comply with **Section 4.3(c)** of the APA.  

4. **Key Implications**:  
   - Avoids disputes by clarifying ownership splits and licensing boundaries.  
   - Ensures both parties benefit from the IP while respecting field-specific exclusivity (Buyer Field vs. non-Buyer Field).  

**Relevance to Query**: This clause directly governs how Joint IP is owned, assigned, and commercialized by the parties, addressing core concerns in joint IP arrangements—such as rights allocation, licensing autonomy, and procedural safeguards.",5
Joint IP Ownership,44a4eb704c,"Neither party may assign (whether by operation of law or otherwise) this IP Agreement, or any of its licenses, rights, privileges or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such attempted assignment shall be void; provided, however, that, following the Initial Closing Date, without any such prior written consent but upon prior written notice to the other party, each party may assign this IP Agreement to: (i) an Affiliate; (ii) a lender for collateral security; (iii) a Person that succeeds to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this IP Agreement relates in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this IP Agreement relates; or (iv) corporate reorganization of the party in which the ultimate ownership of the party immediately prior to such reorganization is the same as the ultimate ownership of the party immediately after such reorganization.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **Joint IP Ownership** because it governs the conditions under which either party can transfer or assign their rights, licenses, or obligations under the IP Agreement to a third party. Here’s how it connects to joint IP ownership:

### Key Relevance to Joint IP Ownership:
1. **Restriction on Unilateral Assignments**  
   - The clause ensures that neither party can unilaterally transfer their rights or obligations under the agreement without the other party’s **prior written consent**. This protects the joint ownership structure by preventing one party from undermining the other’s interests (e.g., by assigning IP rights to a competitor or an untrusted third party).

2. **Exceptions for Permitted Assignments**  
   - While general assignments are restricted, the clause allows certain exceptions (e.g., to affiliates, lenders, or successors in mergers/sales). These exceptions balance flexibility with control, ensuring that joint ownership isn’t disrupted by routine business reorganizations or financing activities.  
   - For example, if one party undergoes a **merger** (iii) or **corporate restructuring** (iv), the IP rights can transfer without consent, provided the ultimate ownership remains consistent. This avoids unnecessary hurdles while preserving the joint ownership framework.

3. **Protection Against Unauthorized Transfers**  
   - Any attempted assignment without compliance (e.g., to a non-affiliate without consent) is deemed **void**, safeguarding the joint owners from unauthorized dilution of their rights.

4. **Notice Requirement**  
   - Even for permitted assignments (like to an affiliate), the assigning party must provide **prior written notice**. This ensures transparency, allowing the other joint owner to monitor changes that might affect their shared IP.

### Why This Matters for Joint IP Ownership:  
Joint ownership requires mutual control over IP to prevent one party from acting in a way that harms the other’s interests. This clause enforces that principle by:  
- **Limiting transfers** unless agreed or under controlled conditions.  
- **Allowing flexibility** for legitimate business needs (e.g., corporate restructuring).  
- **Ensuring accountability** through notice and consent mechanisms.  

In summary, the clause protects the stability and intent of the joint IP arrangement while accommodating practical business scenarios.",5
License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,0171ecf8a0,"For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor also grants to Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license for continued use of the Licensed Mark for the production and sale of inventory containing the Licensed Mark applied to such products during the Transition Period as set forth in section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and in Schedule 2 of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any of the licenses granted by the terms of this Agreement include any right to sublicense, such right to sublicense shall extend to Licensee's subsidiaries and joint venturers.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **license coverage for affiliates of the licensor and/or licensee** in the following ways:

### 1. **Coverage of Affiliates/Subsidiaries**  
   - The clause explicitly extends the license grant to **Licensee's subsidiaries and affiliates**, ensuring they are covered under the same terms as the Licensee. This avoids ambiguity about whether affiliated entities can use the Licensed Mark.  
   - The phrase *""Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliates""* makes it clear that the license is not limited to the primary contracting party but includes its corporate group.

### 2. **Sublicensing Rights for Affiliates**  
   - The clause clarifies that if the license includes sublicensing rights, those rights also extend to **subsidiaries and joint venturers** of the Licensee. This ensures that affiliated entities (e.g., joint ventures) can further sublicense the Licensed Mark if permitted under the agreement.  

### 3. **Transition Period Continuity**  
   - The license allows affiliates to continue using the Licensed Mark for **existing inventory** during a defined **Transition Period**, as referenced in another agreement (Section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Schedule 2). This prevents disruption for affiliated entities post-termination or transition.  

### 4. **Avoidance of Doubt (Clarity)**  
   - The repeated use of *""For the avoidance of doubt""* emphasizes that the parties intended to explicitly include affiliates in the license grant, reducing potential disputes over whether they are covered.  

### **Relevance to Query**  
This clause directly addresses the query by:  
- Confirming that **affiliates of the Licensee** (subsidiaries, joint venturers) are included in the license grant.  
- Ensuring that sublicensing rights (if any) also apply to these affiliates.  
- Providing legal certainty about the scope of permitted use by affiliated entities.  

If the query also sought coverage for **Licensor's affiliates**, this clause does not explicitly mention them—it focuses only on the Licensee's affiliates. A reciprocal clause might be needed if the Licensor's affiliates are intended to have obligations or rights under the agreement.

License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,eeae5344aa,"For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor also grants to Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license for continued use of the Licensed Mark for the production and sale of inventory containing the Licensed Mark applied to such products during the Transition Period as set forth in section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and in Schedule 2 of this Agreement.<omitted>For avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any of the licenses granted by the terms of this Agreement include any right to sublicense, such right to sublicense shall extend to Licensee's subsidiaries and joint venturers.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **license coverage for affiliates of the licensor and/or licensee** in the following ways:

### 1. **Coverage of Licensee's Affiliates**  
The clause explicitly extends the license grant to:  
- **Subsidiaries** (entities controlled by the Licensee).  
- **Affiliates** (entities under common control with the Licensee, even if not direct subsidiaries).  
- **Joint venturers** (entities partnered with the Licensee in joint ventures).  

This ensures that the Licensee’s broader corporate family and partners can use the Licensed Mark under the same terms, avoiding the need for separate agreements.

### 2. **Sublicensing Rights**  
The clause clarifies that if the license includes sublicensing rights, those rights also extend to the Licensee’s **subsidiaries and joint venturers**. This prevents ambiguity about whether affiliates can further delegate usage rights.

### 3. **Purpose and Scope**  
The license is limited to:  
- **Specific use**: Production and sale of existing inventory with the Licensed Mark.  
- **Timebound**: Only during the ""Transition Period"" (as defined in another agreement).  
- **Geographic scope**: Worldwide.  

This ensures affiliates can continue operations seamlessly during the transition without violating IP terms.

### 4. **Legal Clarity (""For Avoidance of Doubt"")**  
The repeated use of this phrase emphasizes intent to prevent disputes over whether affiliates are included, reinforcing that the license is not narrowly limited to the Licensee alone.

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
The clause comprehensively addresses the query by:  
- Defining which affiliates are covered (subsidiaries, joint venturers, and broader affiliates).  
- Explicitly granting them rights under the license.  
- Clarifying sublicensing permissions to avoid future conflicts.  

This ensures both licensor and licensee understand the extent of permitted use by affiliated entities.",5
License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,9e1496b090,"Neither party may assign its rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement to any third party in whole or in part, without the other party's prior written consent, except that (i) Licensee may assign its rights and obligations to this Agreement to any of its Affiliate or subsidiaries with the prior written consent of the Licensor, and (ii) Licensor may assign its rights and obligations in this Agreement to its Affiliates or subsidiaries and either party may assign this Agreement in its entirety to any purchaser of all or substantially all of its business or assets pertaining to the line of business to which this Agreement relates or to any Affiliate of the party without the other party's approval. Except as otherwise specified in the previous sentence, Licensee may not sublicense any of its rights under Section 2(a) without Licensor's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Licensee shall have the right to assign or sublicense any or all of its rights granted under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to third parties exhibiting the Titles in the ordinary course of Licensee's business with prior written notice to Licensor. E","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **""License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee""** because it explicitly addresses the rights and restrictions related to assignments and sublicensing involving affiliates (or subsidiaries) of both the Licensor and Licensee. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Affiliates/Subsidiaries of the Licensee**  
   - The clause permits the **Licensee** to assign its rights/obligations to its **Affiliates or subsidiaries**, but **only with the Licensor’s prior written consent**.  
   - This ensures the Licensor retains control over who can step into the Licensee’s role, even if the assignee is part of the Licensee’s corporate group.  

### 2. **Affiliates/Subsidiaries of the Licensor**  
   - The **Licensor** has broader freedom: it may assign rights/obligations to its **Affiliates or subsidiaries without the Licensee’s approval**.  
   - This reflects a common asymmetry where licensors (often IP owners) retain flexibility to delegate responsibilities within their corporate structure.  

### 3. **General Assignment to Affiliates**  
   - Both parties may assign the Agreement **in its entirety** to an **Affiliate** without the other party’s approval.  
   - This facilitates corporate reorganizations or intra-group transfers while maintaining contractual continuity.  

### 4. **Sublicensing Rights**  
   - The Licensee’s ability to sublicense to **third parties** (e.g., for ordinary business use) requires **notice to the Licensor**, but assignments to Affiliates are treated separately under the consent rules above.  

### Key Relevance to the Query:  
The clause **explicitly governs how affiliates of both parties are treated** in assignments and sublicensing, balancing:  
- **Flexibility** for corporate groups (especially Licensors) to manage internal transfers.  
- **Protections** for the other party (e.g., consent requirements for Licensee’s affiliates).  

It ensures affiliates are neither excluded nor given unchecked rights, addressing the query’s focus on affiliate coverage in licensing agreements.  

**Note:** The clause ends abruptly (""E""), suggesting it may be truncated. A full review would require the complete text to confirm no critical provisions are missing.",5
License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,41ab1a244e,"Licensee may extend the rights granted herein to register, import, export, store, handle, commercialize, promote, distribute and sell to its Affiliates and to its Distributors, provided that Licensee shall first provide to Licensor a written assurance from each of such Affiliate or Distributor to agree to be bound by, and to strictly comply with, all applicable terms, conditions, and obligations in this Agreement towards Licensor.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about covering affiliates of the licensor and/or licensee in a license agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:

1. **Extension of Rights to Affiliates**:  
   The clause explicitly allows the **Licensee** (the party receiving the license) to extend the granted rights to its **Affiliates** (related entities under common control, such as subsidiaries or parent companies). This ensures that the licensee's broader corporate group can benefit from the license without requiring separate agreements for each affiliate.

2. **Conditions for Extending Rights**:  
   The clause imposes a key condition: the Licensee must provide the **Licensor** (the party granting the license) with a **written assurance** from each Affiliate or Distributor. This assurance confirms that the Affiliate/Distributor agrees to be bound by the same terms, conditions, and obligations as the Licensee under the agreement.  
   - This protects the Licensor by ensuring that affiliates/distributors cannot exploit the rights without assuming the same responsibilities (e.g., payment terms, confidentiality, compliance with IP restrictions).

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - For **Licensee’s Affiliates**: The clause clarifies that affiliates are included in the license but must adhere to the agreement’s terms, preventing loopholes.  
   - For **Licensor’s Protection**: It ensures the Licensor retains control over how the licensed rights are used downstream, even by third parties like distributors.  
   - **Notably**, the clause does not explicitly mention the **Licensor’s Affiliates**, suggesting the focus is on the licensee’s side. If the query also concerns the licensor’s affiliates, additional language might be needed to address their rights/obligations (e.g., whether they can enforce the agreement).

**Key Takeaway**:  
This clause is a common way to address affiliates of the licensee in licensing agreements, balancing flexibility for the licensee with safeguards for the licensor. If the query seeks broader coverage (e.g., licensor’s affiliates), the clause may need expansion.",4
License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,6c03a4a6cd,"Licensee shall not be entitled to assign the License or any of its rights under this Agreement or to grant any sub-licenses. This Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, nor may any right or obligations hereunder be assigned or transferred, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that Licensor may, without such consent, assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to an Affiliate or in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to the Licensed Product or the business relating thereto, or in the event of its merger or consolidation or change in control or similar transaction.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **affiliates of the licensor and/or licensee** in the context of assignment and sublicensing rights under a license agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### **1. Affiliates of the Licensor**  
The clause explicitly permits the **Licensor** to assign the agreement or its rights/obligations **to an Affiliate** without requiring the Licensee’s prior written consent. This means:  
- The Licensor has flexibility to transfer the agreement within its corporate group (e.g., parent company, subsidiaries, or entities under common control).  
- The Licensee cannot block such a transfer to an Affiliate, as it is carved out as an exception to the general prohibition on assignment.  

### **2. Affiliates of the Licensee**  
The clause is silent on whether the **Licensee** can assign or transfer rights to its Affiliates. However, it strictly prohibits the Licensee from:  
- Assigning the License or any rights under the agreement.  
- Granting sublicenses (which could otherwise allow Affiliates to benefit indirectly).  
- Transferring obligations without the Licensor’s prior written consent.  

This implies that **Licensee’s Affiliates are not automatically covered** unless the Licensor explicitly consents.  

### **3. Other Permitted Transfers (Licensor Only)**  
Beyond Affiliates, the Licensor may also assign the agreement in cases of:  
- Asset sales (e.g., selling the business related to the Licensed Product).  
- Mergers, consolidations, or change of control.  
Again, these exceptions **do not extend to the Licensee**, reinforcing asymmetry in rights.  

### **Key Relevance to the Query**  
- **Licensor’s Affiliates:** Explicitly allowed to receive assigned rights/obligations.  
- **Licensee’s Affiliates:** No automatic rights; any assignment/sublicensing would require Licensor’s consent.  
- **Asymmetry:** The clause favors the Licensor by granting broader transfer rights (including to Affiliates) while restricting the Licensee.  

### **Practical Implications**  
- **Licensor:** Can restructure internally (e.g., move the license to a subsidiary) without renegotiation.  
- **Licensee:** Must seek approval for any assignment, even to Affiliates, unless the clause is amended.  

If the query seeks to **extend similar affiliate rights to the Licensee**, the clause would need revision to mirror the Licensor’s privileges. Conversely, if the intent is to **restrict all transfers except as stated**, the current language achieves that.

Source Code Escrow,1687c719ec,"Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date, Commerce One agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio, Commerce One and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the ""ESCROW AGENT""). Corio shall bear all fees, expenses and other charges to open and maintain such escrow account. Upon the release of the Source Code to Corio pursuant to Section 12.2 of this Agreement, Corio shall have a royalty-free, nonexclusive, nontransferable, right and license in the Territory to use and modify the Source Code to support and maintain the Software until the expiration or termination of Corio's Customers' End User License Agreements. The Escrow Agent shall require Commerce One to place in an<omitted>escrow account in California a copy of the source code of the Software
including all Updates and Upgrades thereto, documentation and similar materials (the SOURCE CODE). If a Release Condition (as defined in Section 12.2 of this Agreement) occurs and the Escrow Agent provides the Source Code to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio agrees to hold the Source Code in confidence pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 10 of this Agreement, and not to use them for any purpose other than those purposes contemplated under Section 12.3 of this Agreement. Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing if it believes that one of the following events (the ""RELEASE CONDITIONS"") has occurred and that it intends to seek release of the Source Code from the escrow account: (i) Commerce One's dissolution or ceasing to do business in the normal course, or (ii) Commerce One's repeated and material breach of its support and maintenance obligations under Section 5 of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice thereof from Corio. If Commerce One notifies Corio in writing that it disputes whether any such event has occurred, officers of each of the parties shall negotiate for a period of ten (10) business days to attempt to resolve the dispute. At the end of such ten (10) business day period, if the parties have not resolved the dispute, the matter shall be referred to arbitration in the manner provided in Section 14.3 of this Agreement.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **Source Code Escrow** as it outlines the terms and conditions under which the source code of the Software will be held in escrow and potentially released to the licensee (Corio). Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Escrow Agreement Execution** – The clause specifies that Commerce One (the licensor) must execute an escrow agreement with Corio (the licensee) and a mutually acceptable escrow agent within 60 days of the Effective Date. This ensures that the source code is securely deposited with a neutral third party.

2. **Escrow Costs** – It clarifies that Corio is responsible for all fees and expenses related to opening and maintaining the escrow account, which is a common arrangement in such agreements.

3. **License Upon Release** – If the source code is released to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio gains a **royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to use and modify the source code solely for supporting and maintaining the Software until the end of its customers' license agreements. This protects Corio’s ability to maintain the software if Commerce One fails to do so.

4. **Escrow Deposit Requirements** – The clause mandates that Commerce One must deposit the **source code, updates, upgrades, and documentation** with the escrow agent in California, ensuring that Corio has access to the latest version of the software if needed.

5. **Release Conditions** – The clause defines specific **trigger events** (Release Conditions) that would allow Corio to request the source code, such as:
   - Commerce One’s dissolution or cessation of business.
   - Repeated and material breaches of support obligations that remain uncured after 60 days’ notice.

6. **Dispute Resolution** – If Commerce One disputes whether a Release Condition has occurred, the parties must negotiate for 10 business days before escalating to arbitration (as per Section 14.3). This prevents frivolous claims while ensuring a structured resolution process.

7. **Confidentiality & Usage Restrictions** – Corio must keep the source code confidential (per Section 10) and only use it for permitted purposes (as defined in Section 12.3), preventing misuse or unauthorized distribution.

### **Why This Matters for Source Code Escrow**  
This clause ensures that Corio has a **fallback mechanism** to maintain and support the Software if Commerce One becomes unable or unwilling to do so. It balances protection for both parties by:
- Securing the source code in escrow.
- Defining clear release triggers.
- Imposing confidentiality and usage restrictions.
- Providing a dispute resolution process.

This is a **standard but critical** provision in software licensing agreements, particularly where the licensee depends on the licensor’s ongoing support.",5

1. **Escrow Agreement Execution**  
   - The clause mandates that Commerce One must execute an escrow agreement within 60 days of the Effective Date, involving a mutually acceptable escrow agent. This ensures the source code is securely held by a neutral third party.

2. **Escrow Account Responsibilities**  
   - Corio bears all costs for opening and maintaining the escrow account, clarifying financial obligations.

3. **Deposit Requirements**  
   - Commerce One must deposit the **source code**, including updates, upgrades, and documentation, into an escrow account in California. This ensures Corio has access to the latest version of the software if needed.

4. **Release Conditions**  
   - The clause defines specific **Release Conditions** (e.g., Commerce One’s dissolution or material breach of support obligations) under which Corio can request the source code.  
   - A dispute resolution mechanism (negotiation followed by arbitration) is included to handle disagreements over whether a Release Condition has occurred.

5. **License Terms Upon Release**  
   - If the source code is released, Corio receives a **royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to use and modify the code solely to support and maintain the software for its customers until their end-user agreements expire or terminate.  
   - Corio must maintain confidentiality (per Section 10) and restrict usage to permitted purposes (Section 12.3).

### **Why This Matters for Source Code Escrow**  
This clause protects Corio’s business continuity by ensuring access to the source code if Commerce One fails to meet its obligations (e.g., goes out of business or neglects support duties). It also safeguards Commerce One’s intellectual property by limiting Corio’s usage rights and enforcing confidentiality. The structured release process minimizes disputes, making the escrow arrangement fair and enforceable.

   - Changepoint’s dissolution or cessation of business (excluding mergers/acquisitions).  
   - Material breaches of support obligations that remain uncured for 60 days after notice.  
   These conditions provide clarity on when Corio can legitimately access the escrowed materials.

4. **Escrow Agreement Execution**:  
   Changepoint must formalize the escrow arrangement within 60 days of the agreement’s effective date, ensuring timely implementation of the escrow mechanism.

5. **Survival Beyond Agreement Termination**:  
   The escrow survives termination/expiration of the main agreement, continuing for the duration of Corio’s contracts with its customers. This safeguards Corio’s ability to service its clients even if the original agreement ends.

6. **Cost Allocation**:  
   Corio bears all costs for opening and maintaining the escrow account, clarifying financial responsibilities.

Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### **1. Definition and Scope of Liquidated Damages**  
The clause specifies:  
- **When liquidated damages apply**: For breaches of the agreement or platform rules by Party B.  
- **Additional obligation**: Party B must pay an **extra deposit equivalent to the liquidated damages** (e.g., if damages are RMB 1,000, Party B must add RMB 1,000 to the deposit).  

### **2. Breach Classification and Corresponding Damages**  
The clause categorizes breaches into **Class B, C, and D**, with escalating penalties:  
- **Class B Breaches**:  
  - Damages: **RMB 1,000–5,000** (based on severity).  
  - Party B must remedy the breach, and Party A issues a **Confirmation Letter**.  
- **Class C Breaches**:  
  - Damages: **RMB 5,000–50,000** (higher severity).  
  - Similar remedy/notice requirements.  
- **Class D Breaches (Material Breaches)**:  
  - Damages: **Minimum RMB 50,000**.  
  - Party A may **terminate the agreement immediately** and claim **full indemnification** for losses.  

### **3. Termination and Special Cases**  
- **Voluntary Termination**: Either party may terminate with **15 days’ written notice** and payment of **RMB 10,000** in liquidated damages.  
- **Early Termination by Driver User**: If a driver unilaterally ends a **Financial Leasing Agreement**, Party B must collect **30% of ""down payment + total rent + last payment""** as damages.  
  - **Failure by Party B** to enforce this is a **material breach**, triggering **RMB 50,000 damages** and potential termination.  

### **4. Enforcement Mechanism**  
- Party A may **deduct liquidated damages from Party B’s deposit** or demand direct payment.  
- **Deposit top-up**: Party B must replenish the deposit by the damages amount (e.g., pay RMB *N* damages → add RMB *N* to deposit).  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause directly responds to the query by:  
1. Defining **when and how liquidated damages apply** (breaches, termination).  
2. **Quantifying damages** (ranges for different breach classes).  
3. Detailing **procedures** (remedy, notice, deposit adjustments).  
4. Highlighting **material breaches** and termination consequences.  

This ensures **predictability** (fixed damages) and **deterrence** (scaled penalties), which are key purposes of liquidated damages clauses in contracts.  

**Key Takeaway**: The clause is a **risk-allocation tool** protecting Party A (platform) by imposing predefined penalties for Party B’s breaches, while ensuring Party B’s compliance through financial consequences.",5
Liquidated Damages,78643f2042,"The amounts contemplated under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is not a penalty and is intended by the parties only as a compensatory remedy for past breaches and not as a preventative remedy to deter future breaches. Nevertheless, the parties agree that the lump-sum payment provided under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is reasonable in light of the damages for premature termination that may reasonably be expected to occur in such event. If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum payment in an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your Royalty fees and Advertising Contributions due for the last 60 months before our delivery of notice of default (or, if lesser, the months you had been operating before our delivery of notice of default), (b) multiplied by the lesser of 60 or the number of months remaining in the term of this Agreement. The payments called for in Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above constitute liquidated damages for causing the premature termination of this Agreement and not a penalty.","This clause is directly relevant to the query on **""Liquidated Damages""** as it defines the purpose, calculation, and enforceability of such damages in the context of a contractual breach. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Definition and Intent**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the payment under **Section 16.4** is **not a penalty** but a **compensatory remedy** for past breaches (not to deter future breaches). This aligns with the legal principle that liquidated damages must be a reasonable pre-estimate of actual harm, not punitive.  
   - Courts often invalidate clauses deemed punitive, so this language helps ensure enforceability.

### 2. **Reasonableness Justification**  
   - The parties affirm that the lump-sum payment is **reasonable** based on anticipated damages from premature termination. This is critical because liquidated damages must reflect a genuine attempt to quantify losses (e.g., lost royalties/advertising fees) rather than an arbitrary figure.

### 3. **Calculation Methodology**  
   - The formula ensures proportionality:  
     - **Base Amount**: Average of royalties/advertising fees over the **last 60 months** (or actual operating period if shorter).  
     - **Multiplier**: Lesser of **60 months** or the remaining term.  
   - This ties damages to **actual performance history** and **remaining contract duration**, avoiding excessive sums.

### 4. **Premature Termination Context**  
   - The clause applies only if termination results from the counterparty’s **default**, reinforcing its compensatory nature. It covers **foreseeable losses** (e.g., lost recurring revenue) without overreach.

### 5. **Legal Safeguards**  
   - By clarifying the payment as **liquidated damages** (not a penalty), the clause mitigates risks of judicial rejection under contract law principles (e.g., **U.S. common law** or **UNIDROIT principles**).

### **Why This Answers the Query**  
The clause exemplifies a **well-drafted liquidated damages provision** by:  
- Distinguishing compensation from penalty.  
- Providing a transparent, objective calculation.  
- Justifying reasonableness to withstand scrutiny.  
- Focusing on actual harm from breach, not deterrence.  

This ensures compliance with legal standards while protecting the non-breaching party’s economic interests.",5
Liquidated Damages,a654b740f0,"In addition to the foregoing, upon termination of this Agreement by us for cause as described in Section 10, you agree to pay to us within fifteen (15) days after the effective date of this Agreement's termination, in addition to the amounts owed hereunder, liquidated damages equal to the average monthly Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee you paid during the twelve (12) months of operation preceding the effective date of termination multiplied by (a) twenty-four (24) (being the number of months in two (2) full years), or (b) the number of months remaining in the Agreement had it not been terminated, whichever is lower.<omitted>The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages.<omitted>You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision does not give us an adequate remedy at law for any default under, or for the enforcement of, any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections.","This clause is directly relevant to the query on **liquidated damages** as it outlines the specific terms under which such damages are calculated and imposed in the event of termination of the agreement for cause. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Definition of Liquidated Damages**:  
   The clause specifies that liquidated damages are payable upon termination for cause, calculated as a multiple of the average monthly royalty fees (Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee) paid over the 12 months preceding termination. This pre-agreed amount serves as compensation for the franchisor's anticipated losses due to the termination.

2. **Calculation Method**:  
   The damages are computed as:  
   - **24 months' worth** of average royalties (representing 2 full years), **or**  
   - The **remaining months** in the agreement term (whichever is lower).  
   This ensures proportionality and caps the damages to avoid excessive penalties.

3. **Reasonableness and Enforceability**:  
   The clause explicitly states that the parties consider this a **""reasonable, good faith pre-estimate""** of damages, which is a key requirement for enforceability under contract law (to avoid being deemed an unenforceable penalty).  
   It also clarifies that the franchisor’s actual damages (e.g., lost royalties) would be difficult to quantify, justifying the liquidated damages provision.

4. **Scope and Limitations**:  
   The clause limits the remedy to breaches related to **Royalty Fee obligations**, acknowledging that it does not cover other defaults under the agreement. This narrow focus reinforces its reasonableness.

### Why It Answers the Query:  
The clause demonstrates a **standard liquidated damages provision** in franchise agreements, addressing:  
- **When it applies** (termination for cause under Section 10).  
- **How damages are calculated** (based on historical royalties and term length).  
- **Legal safeguards** (reasonableness, proportionality, and purpose).  

This aligns with the query’s focus on understanding the role and structure of liquidated damages in contracts.",5

The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages. You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision does not give us an adequate remedy at law for any default under, or for the enforcement of, any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections.","This clause is highly relevant to the query on **""Liquidated Damages""** because it defines the scope, calculation, and enforceability of liquidated damages in the context of a franchise agreement termination for cause. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Definition of Liquidated Damages**  
   - The clause specifies that liquidated damages are payable upon termination for cause (as defined in Section 10). This pre-agreed sum compensates the franchisor for losses resulting from the franchisee’s breach or default.

### 2. **Calculation Method**  
   - The damages are calculated as:  
     - The **average monthly royalty fees** (Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee + Franchise Sales Royalty Fee) paid by the franchisee over the **preceding 12 months**, multiplied by:  
     - The **lesser of**:  
       - **24 months** (representing 2 full years), **or**  
       - The **remaining term** of the agreement had it not been terminated.  
   - This formula ensures the damages are proportional to the franchisor’s expected losses while preventing excessive penalties.

### 3. **Reasonableness and Enforceability**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the parties agree the amount is a **""reasonable, good faith pre-estimate""** of damages. This language is critical because courts often invalidate liquidated damages clauses deemed punitive or unreasonable.  
   - It clarifies that the franchisor lacks an **""adequate remedy at law""** for breaches of non-royalty provisions, reinforcing the necessity of this clause for enforcement.

### 4. **Scope and Limitations**  
   - The damages are tied specifically to **royalty fees**, not other contractual breaches. This narrow focus helps justify the pre-estimate’s reasonableness.  
   - The 15-day payment deadline ensures timely compensation, reducing disputes over delays.

### Why This Matters for the Query  
The clause directly addresses the purpose of liquidated damages in contracts:  
- **Predictability**: Both parties know the financial consequences of termination for cause.  
- **Compensation**: The franchisor is shielded from unquantifiable losses (e.g., lost future royalties).  
- **Legal Safeguards**: The clause is drafted to comply with legal standards (reasonableness, non-punitive intent), reducing litigation risks.  

If the query seeks to understand how liquidated damages operate in franchise agreements, this clause exemplifies a carefully structured provision balancing fairness and enforceability.",5

2. **Parcel Transfer Due to Vehicle Delay** – If Party B's delay causes a parcel transfer, they must pay escalating damages per trip (RMB500, RMB1,000, or RMB2,000 depending on the delay duration), deducted from the current month's freight.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause defines **pre-agreed compensation amounts** (liquidated damages) rather than requiring proof of actual loss.  
- It ensures **predictability** in penalties for breaches (termination or delays).  
- The damages are structured to **increase with severity** (e.g., higher penalties for longer delays).  
- The mechanism for deduction (from freight payments) ensures **enforceability**.  

This aligns with the legal concept of **liquidated damages**, where parties agree in advance on reasonable compensation for breaches to avoid disputes over actual losses. The clause ensures Party A is compensated without litigation while discouraging Party B from non-performance.  

Would you like an analysis of whether these amounts could be deemed excessive (penalties) under contract law?",5
Insurance,e0cb23f233,"Each Party shall purchase and maintain, at its own expense, the following insurance coverages:
(a) cargo liability insurance, subject to a combined single limit of not less than One Hundred Thousand dollars ($100,000.00) inclusive per occurrence. The other Party shall be named as an additional insured and the policy shall contain a cross liability clause;
(b) automobile, non-owned automobile, fleet, comprehensive general, public and property liability insurance with a limit of not less than Two Million dollars ($2,000,000.00) inclusive of bodily injury and property damage for any one occurrence arising out of one (1) cause. The policy shall cover all non-air operations, non-owned automobile, contractual liability and liability specifically assumed under this Agreement. The other party shall be named as an additional insured and the policy shall contain a cross liability clause; Each Party shall deliver to the other, prior to commencing to provide the Services and thereafter, annually, a certificate or certificates of insurance evidencing that the required insurance coverages as provided for in paragraph 9.1 are in effect and that each Party shall be given thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation or expiry of or material change to such insurance coverages.

Each Party shall ensure that any subcontractor or other party with whom it contracts in providing the Services shall carry adequate insurance coverage, but not less than that provided in paragraph 9.1.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **insurance** in a legal contract, as it comprehensively outlines the insurance obligations of both parties involved in the agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Insurance Requirements**  
The clause mandates that each party must purchase and maintain specific types of insurance coverage, including:  
   - **Cargo liability insurance** (minimum $100,000 per occurrence).  
   - **Automobile, general liability, and other insurance** (minimum $2,000,000 per occurrence).  

   This ensures financial protection against risks such as cargo damage, bodily injury, property damage, and contractual liabilities.

### 2. **Additional Insured & Cross Liability**  
   - The other party must be named as an **additional insured** on the policies.  
   - A **cross liability clause** ensures that coverage applies even if one party sues the other (e.g., in disputes).  

   This protects both parties from third-party claims and inter-party liabilities.

### 3. **Proof of Insurance & Compliance**  
   - Each party must provide **certificates of insurance** before starting services and annually thereafter.  
   - **30-day notice** is required for policy cancellations, expirations, or material changes.  

   This ensures transparency and continuous coverage throughout the contract term.

### 4. **Subcontractor Obligations**  
   - Any subcontractors must carry **equivalent or greater insurance**, extending protections to third-party service providers.  

   This mitigates risk exposure from subcontractors’ operations.

### **Why This Matters for ""Insurance"" Query**  
This clause directly addresses insurance obligations in a contractual relationship, ensuring:  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Financial coverage for potential liabilities.  
- **Legal Compliance**: Adherence to agreed-upon insurance standards.  
- **Contractual Security**: Protects both parties and subcontractors.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Insurance Coverage Requirement** – The clause mandates that **[*]** must maintain insurance policies with **reputable insurers** to cover its obligations and potential liabilities under the agreement. This ensures financial protection for both parties in case of claims or losses.

2. **Financial Responsibility** – It specifies that **[*]** is responsible for all associated costs (premiums, deductibles, retentions), clarifying who bears the financial burden of maintaining the insurance.

3. **Post-Termination Coverage** – The clause requires **[*]** to either:
   - Keep an active policy **or**  
   - Purchase an **extended reporting period (ERP)** (also known as ""tail coverage"") for claims made and reported within **2 years after termination/expiry**.  
   This is crucial for covering **latent claims** (e.g., professional errors or omissions that may surface after the contract ends).

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- **Risk Mitigation**: Ensures that risks (e.g., liability claims, breaches, or damages) are financially covered during and after the contract term.  
- **Compliance & Reputation**: Requires policies from **reputable insurers**, reducing the risk of inadequate coverage.  
- **Long-Term Protection**: The ERP provision safeguards against delayed claims, which is common in industries like construction, consulting, or professional services.

     - **Technology Liability Insurance**:  
       - Covers information/network technology risks.  
       - Minimum: **$1,000,000 aggregate limit**.  

4. **Duration of Coverage**:

Covenant Not To Sue,f3ceb882eb,"There are no representations, warranties or covenants other than those set forth herein.","The clause **""There are no representations, warranties or covenants other than those set forth herein""** is highly relevant to a **Covenant Not To Sue** in the following ways:

1. **Limitation of Obligations**  
   - A Covenant Not To Sue is a promise by one party (typically the claimant) not to pursue legal action against the other party under specified conditions.  
   - This clause clarifies that **no additional promises, guarantees, or legal commitments** (whether express or implied) exist beyond what is explicitly stated in the agreement.  
   - It prevents either party from later claiming that unwritten assurances (e.g., verbal promises or side agreements) modify the Covenant Not To Sue.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Covenants**  
   - Without this clause, a court might imply additional obligations (e.g., implied warranties of good faith or fair dealing) that could undermine the Covenant Not To Sue.  
   - By disclaiming all other covenants, the clause **reinforces the finality** of the agreement, ensuring the Covenant Not To Sue stands alone as the sole limitation on legal recourse.

3. **Risk Allocation**  
   - The clause shifts risk to the party relying on the agreement by confirming they are **not entitled to rely on any statements or promises outside the written contract**.  
   - This is critical in a Covenant Not To Sue, where the releasing party must understand they are giving up legal claims **only as defined in the document**.

### Practical Implications  
If a party later alleges that the other breached an unwritten ""covenant"" (e.g., a supposed promise not to compete), this clause would **defeat such claims** by proving the agreement intentionally excluded extra obligations.

Covenant Not To Sue,5963bd4697,"Each party covenants that it shall not, under any circumstances, sue the other party (or its officers, directors, successors and assigns) or any of that parties' licensees, customers, or distributors (""Protected Entities"") for patent infringment under any future patents or future patent rights relating to said Developments, that either party owns or controls, so long as that Protected Entity has a license from Commerce One or Corio to the Software, or to a product that is a modification of, derivative work based on, or replacement for the Software.","This clause is a **Covenant Not To Sue**—a legally binding promise where each party agrees not to initiate a lawsuit against the other (or specified protected entities) for patent infringement under certain conditions. Here’s how it aligns with the query:  

1. **Scope of Protection**:  
   - The covenant covers **future patents** or **future patent rights** related to ""Developments"" (likely defined elsewhere in the agreement).  
   - It protects not just the other party but also their **officers, directors, successors, assigns, licensees, customers, and distributors** (""Protected Entities"").  

2. **Conditions for Immunity**:  
   - The promise not to sue applies **only if** the Protected Entity has a valid license (from Commerce One or Corio) to:  
     - The **Software** (presumably the subject of the agreement),  
     - Or a **modified version, derivative work, or replacement** of the Software.  

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - This clause **limits future patent disputes** between the parties, fostering collaboration by ensuring licensees and downstream users won’t face infringement claims.  
   - It’s a **risk-mitigation tool**—common in tech/software agreements—to prevent litigation over improvements or expansions of the licensed technology.  

**Key Implication**: By signing, both parties give up the right to sue over future patents tied to the Software, as long as the Protected Entities remain properly licensed. This encourages innovation and commercial use without fear of legal retaliation.

Covenant Not To Sue,58ba4b99f7,"In the event that Party B breaches this covenant, Party A has the right to terminate this Agreement at any time and require Party B to pay 30% of Party A's share of revenues as liquidated damages.","The clause you provided is relevant to the **""Covenant Not To Sue""** query in the following ways:  

1. **Enforcement Mechanism** – A **Covenant Not To Sue** is a legal promise by one party (Party B) not to pursue legal action against another (Party A) under specified conditions. This clause ensures that if Party B violates this promise (e.g., by suing Party A despite the covenant), Party A has the right to **terminate the agreement** and impose financial consequences.  

2. **Liquidated Damages Provision** – The clause specifies that if Party B breaches the covenant, Party A can claim **30% of its share of revenues** as **liquidated damages** (a pre-agreed compensation amount). This discourages Party B from violating the covenant by making the breach costly.  

3. **Termination Right** – The clause reinforces the seriousness of the covenant by allowing Party A to **terminate the agreement immediately** upon breach, rather than being forced to continue under a broken promise.  

### **Key Relevance to ""Covenant Not To Sue""**  
- Ensures **legal and financial consequences** if Party B disregards the covenant.  
- Provides **clarity on remedies** (termination + damages) if Party B sues in violation of the agreement.  
- Acts as a **deterrent** against frivolous or bad-faith litigation by Party B.

Covenant Not To Sue,f7185926a7,"7) All covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the parties contained in this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties; but nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied is intended to confer on any party the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder.","This clause is highly relevant to a **Covenant Not To Sue** because it addresses two key aspects of such agreements:  

1. **Binding Effect on Successors and Assigns**  
   - The clause ensures that the Covenant Not To Sue (a type of promise not to pursue legal claims) remains enforceable not just between the original parties but also against their **successors** (e.g., heirs, executors) and **assigns** (e.g., entities that acquire rights through mergers or transfers).  
   - This prevents a party from circumventing the covenant by transferring claims to a third party.  

2. **Prohibition on Assignment Without Consent**  
   - While the covenant binds successors, the clause explicitly **prohibits unilateral assignment** of rights or obligations under the agreement.  
   - This means neither party can freely transfer their rights (e.g., the right to sue) or duties (e.g., the promise not to sue) to another entity without mutual agreement, preserving the original intent of the covenant.  

### Why It Matters for a Covenant Not To Sue:  
- **Enforceability**: Ensures the covenant’s protection extends beyond the original parties.  
- **Control**: Prevents one party from undermining the agreement by assigning litigation rights to a third party.  

In essence, this clause strengthens the Covenant Not To Sue by both extending its reach to related entities and restricting unauthorized transfers that could weaken its effect.",5
Covenant Not To Sue,fb064df507,"There are no covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions or understandings, either oral or written, between the Parties other than as are set forth herein and therein. No subsequent alteration, amendment, change or addition to this Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties unless reduced to writing and signed by an authorized officer of each Party.","This clause is highly relevant to a **""Covenant Not To Sue""** agreement because it serves two key purposes in such a contract:

1. **Integration (Entire Agreement) Clause**:  
   - It ensures that the written agreement is the **complete and exclusive** expression of the parties' understanding regarding the covenant not to sue.  
   - It explicitly **excludes** any prior or contemporaneous oral or written promises, representations, or side agreements that might undermine the covenant. This prevents a party from later claiming that additional unwritten terms (e.g., verbal assurances) modify the scope of the covenant.

2. **Amendment Formality Requirement**:  
   - It mandates that any future changes to the covenant (e.g., expanding, limiting, or revoking the promise not to sue) must be **in writing and signed by authorized representatives**.  
   - This protects both parties by preventing informal or unilateral modifications, ensuring the covenant’s enforceability remains clear and unambiguous.

### Why It Matters for a Covenant Not To Sue:  
- A covenant not to sue is a **voluntary waiver** of legal claims. This clause reinforces that the agreement is **final and binding**, preventing disputes over alleged ""hidden"" terms or oral modifications.  
- It ensures **legal certainty** by requiring strict formalities for amendments, which is critical when one party is relinquishing their right to litigate certain claims.  

In short, this clause **strengthens the covenant’s enforceability** by eliminating ambiguity and requiring written documentation for any changes.",5
Third Party Beneficiary,5be233053b,"There are no Third Party beneficiaries under this Agreement, except to the extent a Third Party is indemnified pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance); provided that, in no event will any Third Party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance) be allowed to enforce the terms thereof against a Party.","This clause directly addresses the **Third Party Beneficiary** query by clarifying two key points:  

1. **No General Third-Party Rights**: The agreement explicitly states that no third party (i.e., non-signatories) has rights or benefits under the contract, except in one narrow circumstance.  

2. **Limited Exception for Indemnified Parties**: The sole exception is for third parties entitled to **indemnification under Article 12** (e.g., a party’s affiliates, directors, or insurers who are protected by the indemnification provisions). However, even these third parties **cannot enforce the indemnification terms directly** against the contracting parties.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause ensures that **only the contracting parties** have enforceable rights under the agreement, preventing unintended third-party claims.  
- It carves out a **narrow protection** for indemnified third parties (e.g., in liability scenarios) while still restricting their ability to sue under the contract.  
- This balances risk allocation (by allowing indemnification for certain third parties) with contractual certainty (by barring third-party enforcement).  

In essence, it **denies third-party beneficiary status broadly** but preserves indemnification-related protections without granting litigation rights to outsiders.",5
Third Party Beneficiary,1910d646e8,"Except as expressly stated herein with respect to members of each Party, no person or entity not a Party to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any employee of either Party or the Joint Venture) shall be a third-party beneficiary of any provision of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein shall be construed or deemed to confer any benefit or right upon any third party.","The query relates to **""Third Party Beneficiary""**—a legal concept where a person or entity who is not a party to a contract may still have enforceable rights under that contract if the agreement expressly or implicitly intends to benefit them.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
The provided clause explicitly **excludes third-party beneficiary rights** unless specifically stated otherwise in the agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:  

1. **Express Exclusion of Third-Party Rights**  
   - The clause states that **no person or entity outside the Parties** (including employees, affiliates, or the Joint Venture) can claim rights or benefits under the agreement unless the contract **expressly grants them such rights** (e.g., members of each Party).  

2. **No Implied Third-Party Benefits**  
   - Even if a provision could be interpreted as benefiting a third party (e.g., employees or subcontractors), the clause clarifies that **no such interpretation is permitted**.  

3. **Legal Intent to Limit Enforcement**  
   - By including this language, the Parties ensure that **only the signatories** (and any explicitly named beneficiaries) can enforce the agreement, preventing unintended claims from outsiders.  

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
If someone asks whether a third party (e.g., an employee, subcontractor, or unrelated company) can sue under the contract, this clause **denies that possibility** unless the agreement **specifically names them as a beneficiary**.  

This is a **boilerplate provision** commonly used to **prevent unintended legal liabilities** and ensure that contractual rights remain strictly between the Parties.  

Would you like further clarification on any aspect?",5
Third Party Beneficiary,c0b9f75e32,"Ehave shall be a third party beneficiary hereunder, but shall not have any obligations to the End User thereunder.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about **""Third Party Beneficiary""** in a legal contract. Here’s a breakdown of its significance:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Third-Party Beneficiary Status**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that **""Ehave shall be a third party beneficiary hereunder.""**  
   - This means Ehave, though not a party to the contract, is granted enforceable rights under it (e.g., the right to enforce certain provisions or receive benefits).

2. **No Obligations to the End User**:  
   - The clause clarifies that while Ehave has rights, it **""shall not have any obligations to the End User thereunder.""**  
   - This shields Ehave from being held liable or required to perform duties for the End User under the contract.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause addresses the **legal concept of third-party beneficiaries**, which allows non-signatories (like Ehave) to enforce contract terms if the agreement expressly grants them that status.  
- It also **limits Ehave’s role** by excluding obligations, ensuring the End User cannot demand performance from Ehave.  
- This is common in contracts involving intermediaries (e.g., platform providers, licensors) who benefit from protections but avoid direct liability.

### Practical Implications:
- **Ehave can enforce rights** (e.g., sue for breach if its benefits are denied).  
- **End User cannot sue Ehave** for failing to act, as Ehave has no contractual duties to them.  

In summary, the clause defines Ehave’s **rights without responsibilities** under the contract, a classic example of a third-party beneficiary provision.",5

   The clause explicitly states that **bw-3** (presumably a franchisee or related entity) is a **third-party beneficiary** of the addendum. This means that **bw-3** has enforceable rights under the contract, even though it is not a direct party (Lessor or Lessee).  

2. **Extension to Other Franchisees**:  
   The clause further extends third-party beneficiary rights to **""Other System franchisees""**, meaning additional franchisees under the same system may also enforce certain contractual benefits, depending on the context.  

3. **Legal Relevance**:  
   - Under contract law, a **third-party beneficiary** is someone who is not a party to the agreement but is entitled to enforce rights under it.  
   - This clause ensures that **bw-3 and other franchisees** can legally demand performance (e.g., payments, services, or other contractual benefits) from either the Lessor or Lessee if the contract is breached in a way that affects them.  
   - It prevents disputes over whether these entities have standing to sue or enforce terms.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause **clearly defines who qualifies as a third-party beneficiary**, removing ambiguity and ensuring enforceability for **bw-3 and other franchisees** under the agreement.

Third Party Beneficiary,3a665eb6e6,"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, both the Owner and Servicer agree that the Agent shall be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and has the authority to enforce the provisions hereof.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about **""Third Party Beneficiary""** because it explicitly designates the **Agent** as a third-party beneficiary of the agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Third-Party Beneficiary Status**:  
   - The clause confirms that the **Agent** (a non-signatory to the agreement) is intended to have enforceable rights under the contract, even though it is not a party to it. This is a classic example of a third-party beneficiary provision.  
   - The phrase **""deemed to be a third-party beneficiary""** removes ambiguity about whether the Agent qualifies under contract law principles (e.g., under common law or statutes like the U.S. *Restatement (Second) of Contracts* § 302).

2. **Enforcement Rights**:  
   - The clause grants the Agent **explicit authority to enforce the agreement's provisions**, which is a key feature of third-party beneficiary rights. Without such language, the Agent might lack standing to sue for breaches of the contract.  
   - The phrase **""notwithstanding anything to the contrary""** ensures that no other part of the agreement can override this right.

3. **Purpose in Context**:  
   - This provision is common in agreements involving intermediaries (like an Agent in lending or servicing arrangements), where the Agent needs contractual protections to perform its role effectively.  
   - It ensures the Agent can act if the Owner or Servicer fails to meet obligations affecting the Agent’s interests (e.g., payment flows, reporting, or collateral management).

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause answers the query by **affirmatively creating third-party beneficiary rights** for the Agent, clarifying both its status and enforcement power under the agreement. This is critical for contractual certainty, especially in multi-party transactions.

Here’s how it relates to the query:  

### **Key Aspects of the Liability Cap:**  
1. **General Cap on Liability**  
   - The clause sets a fixed monetary limit (**[***]**) on a party’s liability for claims arising from the agreement, covering breaches, negligence, statutory violations, etc.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches** (Section 5) – Material breaches of confidentiality obligations are excluded, meaning liability could be uncapped.  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1) – Claims covered by indemnity (e.g., third-party claims) are not subject to the cap.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence** – Acts showing willful disregard or severe negligence bypass the cap entirely.  

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""**  
   - The clause explicitly defines liability to include **all forms of damages** (contract, tort, statutory, etc.), legal costs, and other losses, ensuring the cap applies comprehensively unless an exception is triggered.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **imposes a clear financial limit** (the cap) on liability, protecting parties from excessive exposure.  
- It **carves out high-risk scenarios** (confidentiality, indemnity, gross negligence) where liability remains uncapped, balancing risk allocation.  
- The broad definition ensures the cap covers **all conceivable claims** unless explicitly exempted.  

### **Practical Implications**  
- **Risk Management:** The cap provides predictability for financial exposure.  
- **Negotiation Point:** The amount (**[***]**) and exceptions are often heavily negotiated.  
- **Enforceability:** Courts generally uphold such caps unless found unconscionable or against public policy.

Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Relevance to ""Cap on Liability"":
1. **Explicit Liability Cap** (§9.1):  
   - The clause caps the total liability of either party to the other at a specified amount (`[***]`), protecting parties from unlimited exposure to claims.  
   - This is a classic example of a **liability cap**, a common contractual mechanism to allocate risk.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap** (§9.1.1–9.1.2):  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - **Confidentiality breaches** (Section 5) or **indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1), meaning liability for these remains uncapped.  
     - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**, ensuring parties cannot evade accountability for egregious acts.  
   - These exceptions balance risk allocation by preserving remedies for high-stakes breaches.

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""** (§9.2):  
   - The clause defines ""liability"" expansively to cover virtually all claims (contract, tort, statutory, etc.), costs (e.g., attorney fees), and damages.  
   - This ensures the cap applies comprehensively unless an exception is triggered.

### Why It Matters for the Query:  
- A party reviewing this clause would understand:  
  - The **maximum financial risk** they face under the agreement (the capped amount).  
  - **Where they remain fully exposed** (e.g., indemnification, confidentiality breaches).  
  - The **scope of claims** subject to the cap (all liability types, unless excluded).

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Liability Cap:
1. **Scope of the Cap**  
   - The cap applies to **most claims** related to breaches of the agreement, including breaches of purchase orders or related agreements.  
   - However, it **excludes** certain high-risk scenarios (e.g., unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional misconduct, or violations of mandatory laws), where liability remains uncapped.

2. **Calculation of the Cap**  
   - The maximum liability is tied to the **total purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products** in the **12 months preceding the claim notification**.  
   - This amount is further reduced by any payments made for **other claims** notified during the same 12-month period.  

3. **Purpose of the Cap**  
   - **Risk Allocation**: Protects both parties from unlimited exposure by setting a predictable, quantifiable limit tied to the commercial relationship (e.g., revenue generated from the agreement).  
   - **Exceptions for Egregious Conduct**: Ensures accountability for intentional wrongdoing or legal violations by excluding those acts from the cap.  

### Why It Answers the Query:  
The clause explicitly defines:  
- **What is capped**: Liability for general breaches.  
- **What is uncapped**: Liability for IP misuse, intentional breaches, or legal non-compliance.  
- **How the cap is calculated**: Based on a 12-month transactional history.

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly caps the aggregate liability of both parties at **AUD 50,000.00** for losses related to the agreement, regardless of the legal theory or cause of action. This protects both parties from unlimited exposure to claims.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**: The clause clarifies that the Liability Cap does **not** apply to:

Here’s how it is relevant:  

1. **Cap on Liability** – The clause explicitly states that **D2's liability** (one of the parties) **shall not exceed** the **total amount paid or owed by the Licensee** under the agreement. This sets a **financial ceiling (cap)** on how much D2 can be held liable for, regardless of the type of claim.  

2. **Exclusion of Certain Damages** – The clause excludes liability for:  
   - **Lost profits**  
   - **Consequential damages**  
   - **Special, incidental, or indirect damages**

3. **Survival Clause** – The limitation applies **even if the primary purpose of the contract fails**, reinforcing that the cap remains enforceable.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **imposes a strict monetary limit (cap) on liability**, protecting D2 from excessive claims.  
- It **shields both parties from certain high-risk damages** (like lost profits), but D2’s exposure is further restricted to only the fees paid under the contract.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Liability Cap Mechanism**  
   The clause states that the maximum liability for claims (except for exclusions like IP breaches, willful misconduct, or legal non-compliance) is tied to the **total purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products** in the **12 months preceding the claim notification**.  
   - *Example*: If $1M was paid in purchases over the prior year, the cap would generally be $1M (minus any prior claims in that period).

2. **Purchase Price as the Baseline**  
   The cap is explicitly calculated based on transactional history (purchase orders), making it dynamic and proportional to the business relationship’s scale. This protects both parties from disproportionate liability risks.

3. **Exclusions**  
   The cap does *not* apply to certain high-risk scenarios (e.g., IP misuse, intentional breaches), ensuring accountability where misconduct or legal violations occur.

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause directly links liability limits to the **purchase price**, answering the query by showing how contractual exposure is financially bounded by the commercial value exchanged (purchases) rather than open-ended damages.

Instead, it sets a fixed monetary limit (AUD 50,000.00) on the aggregate liability of both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising under the Agreement, regardless of the purchase price.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Fixed Cap vs. Purchase Price-Based Cap**  
   - The clause does **not** tie the liability cap to the purchase price (e.g., a percentage or multiple of the purchase price).  
   - It imposes a **fixed, predetermined limit** (AUD 50,000.00), which may or may not relate to the value of the transaction or services.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   - The cap does not apply to specific obligations, such as Fiserv’s duty to remit transaction proceeds or the Merchant’s payment obligations for fees/services. These carve-outs ensure certain critical liabilities remain uncapped, irrespective of the purchase price.  

3. **Implications for the Query**  
   - If the query assumes the liability cap should scale with the purchase price, this clause **does not reflect that principle**.  
   - The clause is more aligned with a **standard limitation of liability** common in contracts, where liability is capped at a fixed amount unless excluded.  

### Suggested Clarification:  
If the intent is to link the liability cap to the purchase price, the clause would need revision—for example:

Here’s the relevance:

1. **Liability Cap Mechanism**  
   The clause states that the Dealer's maximum liability to the Vendor is tied to the **unpaid price** of the specific Products connected to the claim. This means:  
   - The cap is not an arbitrary amount but is **directly derived from the purchase price** of the goods in question.  
   - If the Products were fully paid for, the Dealer’s liability could theoretically be **zero** (since the cap is based on the *unpaid* portion).  

2. **Scope of Claims Covered**  
   The cap applies broadly to **all claims** (contractual, negligence, tort, etc.) arising from the Products, ensuring the Dealer’s exposure is strictly limited to the transactional value (unpaid amount) rather than open-ended damages.  

3. **Alignment with Query**  
   The clause explicitly links liability to the **purchase price** (via the unpaid portion), satisfying the query’s focus on a ""liability cap based on purchase price."" It ensures proportionality between the contractual exchange (price paid for goods) and potential liability.

- Clarify whether the cap applies to **cumulative claims** or **per incident**.  

### Why the Current Clause Falls Short:  
- The placeholder `[***]` lacks specificity—it could be a fixed amount, a multiple of fees, or another metric.  
- Without explicit language linking the cap to the purchase price, the query’s requirement isn’t fulfilled.  

### Suggested Revision:  
To align with the query, amend **Section 9.1** to:

precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability,b9c7504edc,"10. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","The **Limitation of Liability** clause you provided is relevant to the query about **insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability** in the following ways:

### **1. Insurance Coverage as a Factor in Liability Caps**  
Many contracts tie limitation of liability clauses to the availability (or limits) of insurance coverage. For example:  
- If a party’s insurance policy excludes certain damages (e.g., punitive or consequential damages), the contract may explicitly mirror those exclusions to align with insurable risks.  
- The clause here excludes **consequential, indirect, punitive, and other non-direct damages**, which are often uninsurable or subject to lower policy limits.  

### **2. Indemnification Exception Aligns with Insurance**  
The clause carves out an exception for **third-party indemnification claims (Section 9)**, which are typically covered by liability insurance (e.g., general liability, professional liability, or errors & omissions policies). This suggests that:  
- The parties intended for insurable risks (like third-party claims) to remain fully actionable.  
- Non-insurable risks (e.g., lost profits, punitive damages) are excluded to prevent uninsured exposure.  

### **3. Precedents Supporting Insurance-Linked Limitations**  
Courts and contract drafting norms often recognize that:  
- **Insurance availability justifies liability caps**—parties may limit liability to amounts covered by their policies (e.g., *SAP America, Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC*).  
- **Uninsurable damages are frequently excluded**—as seen here with punitive/exemplary damages, which most policies do not cover.  
- **Indemnity carve-outs reflect insurable risks**—third-party claims are more likely to be insured, so they’re treated differently than direct claims between the parties.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause reflects a common contractual strategy: **limiting liability to risks that are feasibly covered by insurance** while excluding damages that insurers typically do not underwrite. Drafters often use such language to align contractual risk allocation with practical insurance realities.

11. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.","The query asks about **precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability**, and the provided **Limitation on Liability** clause (Section 10) is relevant in the following ways:

### 1. **Insurance Coverage as Context for Liability Limits**  
Courts often interpret limitation-of-liability clauses in light of the parties' **insurance arrangements**. If a party has insurance covering certain risks (e.g., general liability, professional liability, or cyber insurance), courts may uphold contractual liability limits—like those in Section 10—as reasonable, since insurance is presumed to allocate risk efficiently.  

   - **Precedent Example**: In *BP Air Conditioning Corp. v. One Beacon Insurance Group*, 8 N.Y.3d 708 (2007), the court considered insurance coverage when enforcing contractual limitations on liability, noting that parties often rely on insurance to mitigate risks excluded by such clauses.  

### 2. **Exclusions Linked to Insurance Gaps**  
Section 10 excludes liability for **consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) unless there’s a breach of confidentiality (Section 11). This carve-out may reflect:  
   - **Intentional Misconduct**: Breach of confidentiality often involves intentional acts, which are typically excluded from insurance coverage (e.g., errors and omissions policies). Thus, the clause aligns liability with uninsurable risks.  
   - **Insurance-Driven Drafting**: Parties may limit liability for insurable risks (e.g., negligence) while preserving recourse for uninsurable breaches (e.g., willful misconduct).  

### 3. **Judicial Treatment of ""Negligence"" Exclusions**  
The clause explicitly disclaims liability for negligence-related damages, which courts scrutinize closely. However, if insurance covers negligence claims, courts are more likely to enforce such limitations (see *Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Noble Lowndes Int’l*, 643 N.E.2d 504 (N.Y. 1994)).  

### 4. **Practical Relevance to the Query**  
The clause demonstrates how contractual liability limits interact with insurance:  
   - **Risk Allocation**: Insurance coverage may justify broad exclusions (e.g., consequential damages) by providing alternative compensation.  
   - **Enforceability**: Courts may uphold limitations if they align with the parties’ risk-transfer mechanisms (insurance).  

### Key Takeaway  
Section 10 exemplifies how limitation clauses are often **drafted with insurance in mind**, and precedents show courts considering insurance when assessing their reasonableness and enforceability. For a deeper analysis, reviewing case law on **""insurance and contractual liability limits""** in your jurisdiction would be advisable.

precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability,3b53923bef,"8.7 Limitation of Liability
Without prejudice to any other limitation (whether effective or not) of either Party's liability, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party (whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or for breach of statutory duty or otherwise) for any loss of profits, use, opportunity, goodwill, business, or anticipated savings, for any indirect, incidental, special, indirect, punitive, or consequential losses (in each case, irrespective of any negligence or other act, default, or omission of a Party (or its employees or agents) and regardless of whether such loss or claim was foreseeable or not and whether the other Party has been informed of the possibility of such loss). Nothing in this Section ​8.7 shall operate to limit or exclude any liability under Section ​8.5 [Indemnification] with respect to a Claim, or for fraud, or for breach by a Party of the provisions of Article ​7 [Confidential Information].","The **Limitation of Liability (LOL) clause (Section 8.7)** in the contract is relevant to the query about **insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability** in the following ways:

### **1. Interaction with Insurance Coverage**  
- Insurance policies often cover certain types of liability (e.g., third-party claims, negligence, or contractual breaches).  
- The **LOL clause excludes certain categories of losses** (e.g., indirect, consequential, lost profits) from liability, which may **align with or differ from insurance coverage**.  
- If insurance does not cover excluded losses (e.g., punitive damages, pure economic losses), the LOL clause reinforces that the party cannot recover them contractually either.  

### **2. Risk Allocation & Insurance Considerations**  
- The clause **shifts risk** by excluding liability for hard-to-insure or uninsurable losses (e.g., goodwill, business interruption).  
- Parties may rely on insurance for **covered risks** (e.g., indemnifiable claims under Section 8.5) while using the LOL clause to **cap exposure for uninsured risks**.  
- Courts may interpret the LOL clause in light of insurance provisions—e.g., if a party has insurance for a risk, they may be less likely to challenge the enforceability of the LOL clause.  

### **3. Exceptions & Overlaps with Insurance**  
- The clause **preserves liability for indemnifiable claims (Section 8.5), fraud, and confidentiality breaches**, which are often **insured risks** (e.g., D&O policies for fraud, cyber insurance for confidentiality breaches).  
- If insurance responds to these exceptions, the LOL clause ensures that the **insured party remains liable** (and thus can claim under their policy) while still limiting exposure for uninsured losses.  

### **4. Precedents & Judicial Treatment**  
- Courts often assess whether LOL clauses are **reasonable** and **conspicuous** (e.g., *Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Lloyd’s of London*).  
- If insurance exists for a risk, courts may be more likely to uphold the LOL clause, as the parties have allocated risk through both insurance and contractual terms (*Tilden Rent-A-Car Co. v. Clendenning*).  
- Conversely, if a loss is **expressly uninsurable** (e.g., intentional misconduct), the LOL clause may still be enforceable to bar recovery.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **complements insurance coverage** by:  
- Excluding liability for **uninsurable or high-risk losses** (indirect/consequential damages).  
- Preserving liability for **typically insured risks** (indemnification, fraud, confidentiality breaches).  
- Reinforcing **risk allocation** between contractual limitations and insurance protection.

precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability,996a52f6b8,"Service Provider shall provide and maintain excess liability insurance covering employer's liability, commercial general liability, and business automobile liability, in the amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) combined single limit policy limit per occurrence and in the aggregate for bodily injury and property damage. All policies of insurance referred to in this Section 4.1 shall be endorsed: (i) to specify that they are primary to and not excess to or on a contributing basis with any insurance or self-insurance maintained by Owner, Owner and User (and their respective Affiliates) or any SubService Providers in respect of losses arising out of or in connection with the Services; (ii) to include Owner, Owner, User and, upon User's request and if applicable, User's landlord, or a subsequent owner, tenant or subtenant of the Premises as additional insureds; and (iii) contain a standard severability of interests clause.

(b) Automobile Liability. Service Provider shall provide and maintain business auto liability insurance covering owned, non-owned and hired automobiles in the amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined<omitted>single policy limit for bodily injury and property damage for each accident.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **""precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability""** because it demonstrates how contractual insurance requirements can shape and constrain the scope of a party's liability in several key ways:

### 1. **Insurance as a Limitation Mechanism**  
   - The clause mandates specific insurance coverage (e.g., $5M excess liability, $2M general liability, $1M auto liability), which effectively caps the Service Provider's potential financial exposure for claims within these policy limits.  
   - By requiring primary coverage (not excess/contributory), the clause ensures that the Service Provider's insurance is the first line of defense, shielding both the Service Provider and additional insureds (e.g., Owner, User) from direct liability up to the policy limits.  

### 2. **Transfer of Risk**  
   - The inclusion of Owner, User, and others as **additional insureds** shifts liability risks to the Service Provider’s insurer. This reduces the Owner’s/User’s exposure to claims arising from the Services.  
   - The **severability of interests** clause ensures that coverage applies separately to each insured, preventing disputes over policy limits being exhausted by one party’s claims.  

### 3. **Alignment with Liability Caps**  
   - In many contracts, the required insurance limits mirror or inform the **limitation of liability clauses**. For example, a party’s liability cap might be tied to the insurance coverage they maintain (e.g., ""Liability shall not exceed the greater of $X or available insurance proceeds"").  
   - Here, the $5M excess liability policy could implicitly set a benchmark for the Service Provider’s maximum liability in related claims, even if not explicitly stated elsewhere in the contract.  

### 4. **Compliance as a Condition**  
   - The clause makes insurance a contractual obligation, and failure to maintain it could constitute a material breach. Courts often interpret such requirements as evidence of the parties’ intent to allocate risk via insurance rather than unlimited liability.  

### Precedential Value  
Courts and arbitrators frequently look to insurance requirements to interpret the parties’ risk allocation intent. For example:  
   - If a dispute arises over a $3M claim, the Service Provider might argue liability is capped at $2M (per the general liability policy), while the Owner could counter that the excess policy ($5M) applies. The clause’s specificity aids in resolving such disputes.  
   - Case law often upholds that insurance terms influence liability limits (e.g., *Couch on Insurance* and rulings where policy limits are deemed de facto liability caps).  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause exemplifies how insurance provisions can **define, transfer, or limit liability** contractually. It provides a precedent for linking insurance coverage to liability exposure, ensuring risks are borne by insurers rather than the parties directly. For a full analysis, you’d cross-reference this with the contract’s **limitation of liability** and **indemnification** clauses.

precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability,e156a5b7c4,"28.2. Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The clause you provided is a **Limitation of Liability (LoL) provision**, which restricts the maximum amount one party can recover from the other for breaches of the agreement, except in cases of personal injury or death caused by negligence (where liability is unlimited by law).  

### **Relevance to Insurance Coverage Influencing Limitation of Liability**  
1. **Insurance as a Backstop for Liability Caps**  
   - Many contracts align liability caps with available insurance coverage. If a party’s liability is capped at the amount paid under the agreement (as in your clause), they may structure their insurance policies (e.g., professional liability or errors & omissions insurance) to cover exposures up to that limit.  
   - Courts sometimes consider insurance availability when assessing the reasonableness of liability caps. If a party has sufficient insurance to cover the cap, the clause is more likely to be enforceable.  

2. **Risk Allocation Between Parties**  
   - The clause shifts financial risk by limiting recovery to payments made under the agreement. If insurance covers liabilities beyond this cap, the parties may negotiate higher limits or exceptions (e.g., for gross negligence).  
   - Precedents (e.g., *British Westinghouse v. Underground Electric Railways* [1912]) show courts upholding liability limits where insurance or alternative risk-sharing mechanisms exist.  

3. **Exclusions for Uninsurable Risks**  
   - The carve-out for ""personal injury or death caused by negligence"" reflects risks that are typically uninsurable or subject to mandatory unlimited liability (e.g., under tort law). This aligns with insurance market norms where certain liabilities cannot be capped.  

4. **Judicial Interpretation & Precedents**  
   - Cases like *Toppan v. Uniroyal* (1984) have examined whether liability caps are enforceable when insurance could cover higher losses. Courts may strike down caps if they are unconscionable or conflict with public policy, but insurance-backed caps are often upheld.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
Your clause is a **payment-based liability cap**, common in service agreements. Its enforceability may depend on:  
- Whether insurance covers the capped amount.  
- Whether exceptions (e.g., negligence) align with insurable risks.  
- Jurisdictional precedents on reasonableness of limitations.

Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The query asks about **""Fix fee liability cap""**, which likely refers to a request to clarify or modify the **limitation of liability clause** in the agreement to ensure it properly addresses fixed fee-related liabilities.  

### **Relevance of Clause 11.4 to the Query:**  
1. **Liability Cap (AUD 50,000.00)**  
   - The clause sets a **maximum financial exposure** (AUD 50,000) for both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising from breaches or other claims under the agreement.  
   - If the query seeks to adjust this cap (e.g., to align with a fixed fee structure), the clause would need amendment to specify whether the cap applies to fixed fees or excludes them.  

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**  
   - The clause **excludes** certain obligations from the cap, such as:  
     - Fiserv’s duty to remit transaction proceeds.  
     - The Merchant’s payment obligations (e.g., service fees, network security fees, regulatory penalties).  
   - If the query concerns **fixed fees** (e.g., recurring service fees), they likely fall under the **excluded obligations** (item 2), meaning the liability cap **does not apply** to them.  

### **Suggested Fixes (if needed):**  
- If the intent is to **include fixed fees under the liability cap**, the clause should be revised to remove them from the exceptions.  
- If the intent is to **clarify that fixed fees are excluded**, the clause could explicitly list them (e.g., *""including fixed service fees""*) under the exceptions.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause is relevant because it defines the **scope of financial liability**, including whether fixed fees are subject to the AUD 50,000 cap or treated as an uncapped obligation. The current wording likely excludes fixed fees from the cap, but this can be adjusted per the parties' agreement.

The provided **Limitation of Liability clause (Section 9)** directly addresses this by:

1. **Establishing a Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause sets a fixed maximum liability amount (denoted as `[***]`) that one party can owe the other, unless exceptions apply. This aligns with the ""fix fee"" aspect of the query by capping exposure to a specific sum.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - Breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)  
     - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)  
     - Intentional misconduct or gross negligence  
   - This ensures the cap is not absolute and preserves liability for high-risk scenarios.

3. **Scope of ""Liability""**:  
   - The clause broadly defines liability to include claims, legal costs, damages, and losses arising from any legal theory (contract, tort, statute, etc.). This clarifies that the cap covers all potential financial exposures unless excluded.

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause **fixes a liability cap** while carving out exceptions for significant risks (e.g., breaches of core obligations or bad-faith actions). If the query seeks to modify the cap amount or adjust exceptions (e.g., adding/excluding indemnification), this clause provides the framework for such negotiations.

     - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**, ensuring accountability for egregious acts.  
   - This ensures the cap is balanced and does not shield parties from severe breaches or specific obligations.

3. **Scope of ""Liability""**:  
   - The clause broadly defines liability to include all claims, costs, damages, and legal expenses (contractual, tort, statutory, etc.), clarifying that the cap applies comprehensively unless an exception is triggered.

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause provides a template for ""fixing"" a liability cap while addressing common carve-outs. If the query seeks to adjust the cap amount or modify exceptions (e.g., adding/excluding categories like IP infringement), this clause serves as a foundation for negotiation.

Section 7.1 Aggregate Limit of Liability.
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall a Party be liable to the other Party for an aggregate amount in excess of the Maximum Liability; provided that such limitation of liability shall not apply to any liability that is the result of (i) gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of a Party, (ii) a Third Party Claim, (iii) the failure to pay the Service Fees (which amount shall not be included in calculating Owner's Maximum Liability), (iv) a claim of Owner against BE or Operator in the event of any breach, default or misrepresentation of any representation and warranty or covenant set forth in Section 8.2(e) or (v) a claim of Owner against BE or Operator under Section 2.8. Subject always to the Maximum Liability limitations set forth in the preceding sentence, except for damages specifically provided for in this Agreement or in connection with the indemnification for damages awarded to a third party under a Third Party Claim, damages hereunder are limited to direct damages, and in no event shall a Party be liable to the other Party, and the Parties hereby waive claims, for (a) indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages or loss of profits; provided, however, that the loss of profits language set forth in this Section 7.1 shall not be interpreted to exclude from Indemnifiable Losses any claim, demand, suit, loss, liability, damage, obligation, payment, cost or expense (including the cost and expense of any action, suit, proceeding, assessment, judgment, settlement or compromise relating thereto and reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable disbursements in connection therewith) that would otherwise be included in the definition of Indemnifiable Losses because they result from a reduction in the profits of Owner, Diamond State Generation Holdings, LLC, or both, and (b) losses or liabilities incurred by the officers, directors, members, managers, partners, shareholders or Affiliates of such Party (unless on behalf of Owner).
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, in no event shall Operator be liable under this Agreement (including with respect to its obligations related to the Facility Service Warranty, the Power Performance Warranty or Warranty Specification) for (i) any failure of or damage to the Bloom System or (ii) any obligations on the part of Operator (including internal rate of return or other financial metrics or any obligations to deliver power to Owner or service the Bloom System) caused by or arising from (A) Owner's (as opposed to Operator or Operator's Affiliate or subcontractor acting as operator under this Agreement) failure to properly protect the Bloom Systems from vandalism or other third- party's actions or omissions, (B) Owner's (as opposed to Operator or Operator's Affiliate or subcontractor acting as operator under this Agreement) failure to use the specified input fuel; (C) Owner's (as opposed to Operator or Operator's Affiliate or subcontractor acting as operator under this Agreement) removal of any safety devices, (D) Force Majeure Events, (E) installation, operation, repair or modification of the Bloom Systems by anyone other than Operator or Operator's authorized agents or Owner's operator acting pursuant to a operating and maintenance agreement provided such operator is acting in accordance with Prudent Electrical Practices and information or materials supplied by Operator or its Affiliates, or (F) any defect in construction materials or workmanship of the BOF or any deficiency in design of the BOF by BE, provided that the exclusions in this clause (F) shall not extend to any warranty claim to the extent caused by or arising from (1) any defect in construction materials or workmanship of the BOF or (2) any deficiency in design of the BOF by BE, in each case during the period while the MESPA Section 8.2(b) Warranty is in effect. OPERATOR SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE TO BLOOM SYSTEMS OR THEIR COMPONENTS DUE TO THEIR OPENING OR MODIFICATION BY OWNER OR ANYONE OTHER THAN OPERATOR, OPERATOR'S AFFILIATE, THE SERVICE PROVIDER OR SUBCONTRACTOR, ACTING AS OPERATOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PERSON ACTING AS AN OPERATOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (OR ANY SUCCESSOR AGREEMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT) OR ANY OF SUCH PERSON'S REPRESENTATIVES. Except for Owner's payment of money to Operator, and subject to Section 9.19 hereof, neither Party shall be liable under any circumstance, nor be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement, for any delay or failure in performance or interruption of service resulting from any Force Majeure Event, or any other cause or causes which are beyond such Party's reasonable control.
Section 7.2 No Duplication of Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement and the MESPA are to be calculated on an aggregate basis taking into account all claims (if any) made under this Agreement and the MESPA.","The query asks about the **""fix fee liability cap""**, which refers to a contractual limitation on the maximum financial liability a party can incur under the agreement. The provided clause outlines the **""Maximum Liability""** framework and other limitations on liability, which directly address the concept of a liability cap. Here’s how the clause is relevant:

### 1. **Definition of Maximum Liability (Liability Cap)**
   - **Operator's Cap**: The maximum liability for the Operator is tied to the **Residual Value of the Portfolio** (a dynamic amount based on the portfolio's value at a given time).
   - **Owner's Cap**: The Owner's liability is fixed at **$1,000,000**, which is a clear ""fee liability cap"" for the Owner.
   - The clause explicitly states that **reductions in the Operator’s liability cap cannot force the Owner to refund money**, protecting the Owner from clawback claims.

### 2. **Aggregate Limit of Liability (Section 7.1)**
   - **General Cap**: No party can be held liable for amounts exceeding their **Maximum Liability**, except for specific carve-outs (e.g., gross negligence, fraud, Third Party Claims, unpaid Service Fees, breaches of Section 8.2(e), or claims under Section 2.8).
   - **Exclusions from the Cap**: Certain liabilities (like intentional misconduct or Third Party Claims) are **not subject to the cap**, ensuring accountability for egregious acts or external claims.
   - **Damage Limitations**: The clause restricts recoverable damages to **direct damages** and waives claims for indirect/consequential damages (e.g., lost profits), unless those lost profits are tied to indemnifiable losses.

### 3. **Operator-Specific Protections (Section 7.1(b))**
   - The Operator is shielded from liability for:
     - Failures/damages to the Bloom System caused by **Owner’s actions** (e.g., misuse, vandalism, fuel mismanagement).
     - **Force Majeure Events** or third-party actions outside the Operator’s control.
   - This reinforces the **practical scope of the liability cap** by excluding scenarios where the Operator is not at fault.

### 4. **No Duplication of Claims (Section 7.2)**
   - The liability cap applies **aggregately across this Agreement and the MESPA**, preventing double-counting of claims under related contracts. This ensures the cap functions as a **true ceiling** for total exposure.

### **Relevance to the Query**
The clause directly addresses the **""fix fee liability cap""** by:
- Setting **fixed ($1M for Owner) and variable (Residual Value for Operator) liability limits**.
- Clarifying **exceptions** where the cap does not apply (e.g., fraud, Third Party Claims).
- **Limiting damage types** (direct vs. indirect) to further control exposure.
- Ensuring the cap is **aggregate across linked agreements** (no duplication).

This structure provides predictability for both parties while safeguarding against unlimited liability, which is the core purpose of a ""fix fee liability cap."" The Owner’s $1M cap is a clear example of such a fixed limit.",5

### **Relevance of Clause 11.3 to the Query:**  
1. **Liability Cap Mechanism**  
   - The clause explicitly limits the total aggregate liability of one party to the other for any **Claim** (breach of the agreement, purchase order, or related documents) to a **specific, calculable amount**.  
   - The cap is set at:  
     > *""the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products during the **twelve calendar months preceding the Claim notification**, minus any amounts already paid/payable for other Claims in that period.""*  

   This ensures that liability is **not open-ended** but tied to a **fixed, measurable fee** (i.e., the preceding 12 months' purchase value).  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The cap **does not apply** to:  
   - Liability for **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property** (IP breaches).  
   - Liability due to **intentional breach or willful misconduct**.  
   - Liability arising from **non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**.  

   These carve-outs ensure that **egregious or unlawful conduct** is not shielded by the cap.  

3. **Link to ""Fix Fee"" Concept**  
   - The clause **fixes the maximum liability** to a **fee-based formula** (12 months of purchase prices), addressing the query by providing a **predictable, quantifiable limit**.  
   - It avoids ambiguity by **defining the exact calculation method**, ensuring both parties understand the financial exposure.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause directly answers the query by:  
- **Capping liability** at a **fixed, fee-derived amount** (12 months of purchases).  
- Clarifying that the cap **does not apply** to certain high-risk breaches (IP, misconduct, legal violations).  
- Providing a **clear, enforceable formula** to determine the liability limit.  

Thus, it ensures that liability exposure is **both limited and calculable**, aligning with the intent behind a ""fix fee liability cap.""",5

Here’s the breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **12-Month Payment Cap**:  
   - The liability cap is calculated based on the **total purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products in the 12 months before the claim is notified**.  
   - Example: If the Distributor paid $1M over the prior 12 months, the maximum liability for a claim would generally be $1M (minus any amounts already paid for other claims in that period).

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap **does not apply** to:  
   - Liability for **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property**.  
   - Liability arising from **intentional breach or willful misconduct**.  
   - Liability for **non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**.  
   (These carve-outs allow unlimited liability for egregious or unlawful conduct.)

3. **Adjustment for Multiple Claims**:  
   If multiple claims arise within the same 12-month window, the cap is reduced by amounts already paid for prior claims in that period. This prevents ""double-dipping"" beyond the 12-month payment total.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **explicitly ties the liability cap to 12 months of payments**, matching the query’s focus.  
- It clarifies **how the cap is calculated** (payments in the 12 months before claim notification) and **when it does not apply** (e.g., for IP breaches or willful misconduct).  
- The **""less any amounts paid for other claims""** provision ensures the cap is a true aggregate limit for the 12-month period.

### Practical Implications:
- **Predictability**: Both parties know the maximum exposure is linked to recent transactional history (12 months of payments).  
- **Risk Allocation**: The Distributor’s liability is bounded, but Accuray retains recourse for serious misconduct or IP violations.  

In summary, the clause **operationalizes the ""cap equals 12 months payment"" rule** while carving out exceptions for higher-risk scenarios.",5

### 1. **Cap on Liability for Specific Damages**  
   - **Subsection 12.1(b)** limits liability for **material breaches of the agreement** to a maximum amount (either a fixed sum or an amount specified in **Appendix 2**, whichever is higher) **within any 12-month period**.  
   - If **Appendix 2** or another part of the agreement specifies that the cap is **""12 months' payment""** (e.g., 12 times the average monthly fee under the contract), this would align with the query.  
   - The clause ensures that liability for breaches does not exceed this predefined 12-month cap.

### 2. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
   - **Subsection 12.2** explicitly excludes liability for **indirect or consequential losses** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm), reinforcing that the only recoverable damages are those directly tied to breaches, subject to the 12-month cap.

### 3. **No Employee Liability**  
   - **Subsection 12.3** clarifies that employees are not personally liable, ensuring that liability remains confined to the contractual cap on the corporate entity.

### **Conclusion**  
The clause supports the query by:  
- Imposing a **12-month financial cap** on liability for material breaches (likely tied to payments, if Appendix 2 specifies this).  
- Restricting recoverable damages to **direct losses** (excluding indirect/consequential claims).  
- Ensuring the cap applies **per 12-month period**, preventing unlimited exposure.  

If **Appendix 2** or another section defines the cap as **""12 months’ payment,""** this clause enforces that limitation. Otherwise, the exact monetary cap would need to be filled in (marked by `***` in the draft).

### 1. **Cap on Liability for Material Breach (12.1(b))**  
   - The clause limits liability for **material breaches of the agreement** to a maximum amount (denoted by ""***"" or as specified in **Appendix 2**), **whichever is higher**, within any **12-month period**.  
   - If the agreed cap in Appendix 2 (or the unspecified ""***"") is defined as **12 months' worth of payments**, this would directly align with the query.  
   - Example: If the service fee is **$10,000/month**, the cap could be **$120,000** (12 × $10,000) for material breaches in a 12-month period.

### 2. **Time-Based Limitation (12.1(a) & (b))**  
   - Both sub-sections **(a) and (b)** impose **12-month rolling limits** on liability, meaning claims cannot exceed the specified cap **within any 12-month window**.  
   - This ensures that liability exposure is predictable and tied to a defined period, similar to the query’s reference to ""12 months.""

### 3. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages (12.2)**  
   - The clause **further limits liability** by excluding indirect losses (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm), reinforcing that the **only recoverable damages** are those explicitly capped under **12.1**.  
   - This supports the idea that the **maximum exposure** is strictly tied to the agreed cap (e.g., 12 months' fees).

### 4. **Protection Against Employee Liability (12.3)**  
   - While not directly related to the financial cap, this subsection ensures that **individual employees** cannot be held personally liable, keeping the liability framework focused on the **contractual cap between the parties**.

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **structurally aligns** with the query by:  
- Imposing a **12-month monetary cap** on liability for material breaches (potentially matching 12 months' payments if Appendix 2 specifies it).  
- Using a **rolling 12-month period** to limit exposure.  
- Explicitly **excluding indirect damages**, ensuring the cap applies only to direct claims.  

If **Appendix 2** explicitly defines the cap as **""12 times the average monthly payment,""** then this clause fully implements the requested limitation. Otherwise, the placeholder (""***"") suggests the amount is negotiated separately.

### **Key Relevance:**
1. **Monetary Cap on Liability**  
   - The clause explicitly limits a party’s liability to predefined maximum amounts for specific types of damages (e.g., property damage, personal injury, or material breach).  
   - While the exact monetary caps are redacted (marked as `***`), the structure suggests that liability is **capped per event or per 12-month period**, aligning with the query’s reference to a **time-based (12-month) limitation**.  

2. **12-Month Liability Period**  
   - Subsection **12.1(b)** specifies that liability for material breaches is capped at a maximum amount **""in any period of 12 calendar months.""**  
   - This mirrors the query’s phrasing of a **""12 months payment"" cap**, implying that the maximum exposure is tied to a yearly timeframe.  

3. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
   - **12.2** reinforces the cap by **excluding liability** for indirect losses (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm), further narrowing recoverable damages to direct losses within the agreed limits.  

4. **No Employee Liability**  
   - **12.3** clarifies that employees/affiliates cannot be held personally liable, ensuring the cap applies only to the contracting parties.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **imposes a financial and temporal cap on liability**, restricting claims to a maximum amount over a **12-month period** (likely tied to contractual payments, as hinted in the query). While the exact figures are unspecified, the structure confirms that liability is **not open-ended** and is instead **limited by both amount and duration** (12 months).  

If Appendix 2 (referenced in **12.1(b)**) defines the cap as **""12 months’ payment,""** this would directly answer the query. Otherwise, the clause still reflects the **principle of a time-bound liability limit**.

This right to audit shall extend throughout the term of this Agreement and for one year after expiration or termination of this Agreement.","The query asks about a **""cap on liability equal to 12 months' payment.""**  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
The clause outlines post-termination payment obligations and insurance requirements but does **not** explicitly state a liability cap tied to 12 months of payments. Here’s how the clause relates (or does not relate) to the query:  

1. **Post-Termination Payments**:  
   - Depomed must pay King a percentage of Net Sales for **8 quarters (2 years)** after termination.  
   - The payments are structured as **[***]% of Net Sales for the first 4 quarters** and a reduced percentage for the next 4 quarters.  
   - While this spans **24 months**, the query references a **12-month cap**, which is not directly stated here.  

2. **Insurance Requirements**:  
   - Both parties must maintain liability insurance (general and product liability) during the term and for **2 years post-termination**.  
   - The policy limits are specified (e.g., ""$[***] per occurrence""), but these are **insurance minimums**, not a contractual **liability cap**.  

3. **Missing Link to 12-Month Cap**:  
   - The clause does **not** limit liability to 12 months of payments.  
   - If the query assumes that the post-termination payments (which last 24 months) should be capped at 12 months, this clause does **not** reflect that.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause describes **ongoing financial obligations** (payments and insurance) post-termination but does **not** impose a **12-month liability cap**. If such a cap exists, it would likely be found elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., in a **limitation of liability** or **indemnification** section).

The provided **Clause 17** addresses this directly by:  

### **1. Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 17(a))**  
- The clause explicitly states that **neither party will be liable** for:  
  - **Consequential, incidental, exemplary, or punitive damages** (even if warned in advance).  
  - **Lost revenue, lost profits, or lost savings** (a subset of consequential damages).  
- This means that if a breach occurs, the harmed party **cannot claim compensation** for these types of indirect losses.  

### **2. Cap on Direct Damages (Section 17(b))**  
- While the query focuses on **indirect damages**, the clause also imposes a **monetary cap** on **direct damages**:  
  - Liability is limited to the **total payments made under the agreement in the 12 months before the claim arose**.  
  - This ensures that financial exposure is predictable and proportionate to the contract value.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **fully addresses the cap on liability for indirect damages** by **excluding them entirely** (Section 17(a)), while also capping direct damages (Section 17(b)).  
- **Exceptions (if any)** would be governed by **Section 17(c)**, which is referenced but not provided here. Typically, such exceptions might include:  
  - Willful misconduct, gross negligence, or fraud.  
  - Claims covered by indemnification clauses (e.g., IP infringement, third-party claims).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause **strongly limits liability for indirect damages** (as requested in the query) while also imposing a **financial ceiling on direct damages**, balancing risk allocation between the parties. If **Section 17(c)** includes carve-outs, those would modify the limitations.

1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for **consequential, incidental, special, or other indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits), even if the other party was aware such damages could occur. This means claims for indirect losses are **entirely excluded**, not just capped.  

2. **Cap on Direct Damages**:  
   While the clause limits **direct damages** to **$15 million**, the query focuses on **indirect damages**, which are treated differently—they are **not subject to a monetary cap** but are instead **wholly excluded** (with exceptions noted below).  

3. **Exceptions**:  
   - Claims under **Section 9** (unspecified here) are exempt from the $15M cap on direct damages.  
   - Third-party claims for **personal injury or tangible property damage** caused by a product are also excluded from the indirect damages waiver, meaning such claims could still be pursued.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause confirms that **indirect damages are not just capped but entirely barred** (with narrow exceptions), while direct damages are subject to a financial limit. This aligns with the query by clarifying that the agreement **does not permit recovery of indirect damages** (like lost profits) at all, regardless of foreseeability.

### 1. **General Liability Cap (Section 9.1)**  
   - The clause imposes a **maximum liability limit** (""Liability Cap"") for **all claims** arising under the Agreement, which would typically include **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, or special damages) unless explicitly excluded.  
   - The broad definition of **""liability""** in **Section 9.2** explicitly covers **all types of damages**, including those arising from **contract, tort (negligence), or statutory claims**, which would encompass indirect damages.  

### 2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Sections 9.1.1 & 9.1.2)**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches (Section 5)** – Meaning indirect damages from a breach of confidentiality are **uncapped**.  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** – Indemnified claims (e.g., third-party claims) are **not subject to the cap**, including indirect damages flowing from them.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence** – Indirect damages caused by willful or reckless acts are **fully recoverable**.  

### 3. **Implications for Indirect Damages**  
   - **Indirect damages are likely capped** under the general Liability Cap unless they fall under one of the exceptions (e.g., if caused by a confidentiality breach or gross negligence).  
   - The clause does **not explicitly exclude indirect damages** from the cap, suggesting they are included in the limitation unless an exception applies.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **limits liability for indirect damages** under the general cap but **allows uncapped recovery** in cases of confidentiality breaches, indemnified claims, or intentional/grossly negligent conduct. If the parties want to **explicitly exclude indirect damages** from the cap, further drafting adjustments would be needed.

### 1. **Scope of Liability Cap**  
   - The clause imposes a **maximum liability cap** (""[***]"") for **all claims** arising under the Agreement, which would typically include **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, or special damages) unless explicitly excluded.  
   - The broad definition of **""liability""** in **Section 9.2** encompasses **all forms of damages**, including those arising from contract, tort (e.g., negligence), or statutory claims, unless carved out.  

### 2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Indirect Damages May Still Apply)**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Material confidentiality breaches (Section 5)** – Indirect damages (e.g., reputational harm, lost profits from leaked secrets) could be claimed **without limit**.  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** – If indemnity covers third-party claims (e.g., IP infringement), indirect damages (e.g., downstream losses) may be uncapped.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence** – Indirect damages resulting from such conduct are fully recoverable.  

### 3. **Implications for Indirect Damages**  
   - **Indirect damages are likely capped** under the general Liability Cap unless they fall under the exceptions above.  
   - The clause **does not explicitly exclude indirect damages** from the cap (unlike some agreements that carve them out separately), suggesting they are subject to the limit unless tied to breaches of confidentiality, indemnity, or willful misconduct.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause **limits liability for indirect damages** to the agreed cap ([***]) **unless** the damages arise from:  
1. A material breach of confidentiality,  
2. An indemnifiable claim, or  
3. Intentional/grossly negligent acts.

     - Damages arising from **breach of contract, tort (e.g., negligence), or other legal theories**, even if the party was aware such damages could occur.  
   - This creates a strong **barrier against claims for indirect losses**.  

2. **Cap on Liability** –  
   - Section 20(b) imposes a **monetary limit** on liability, restricting it to:  
     - *The amounts actually paid by the other party* under the contract.  
   - This means **total liability cannot exceed the fees exchanged**, effectively capping exposure.  

3. **Exceptions** –  
   - The clause carves out exceptions (referencing Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), etc.), meaning certain scenarios (e.g., gross negligence, willful misconduct, or specific breaches) may **override the cap/exclusion**.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause:  
- **Prohibits claims for indirect damages** (e.g., consequential losses).  
- **Sets a financial ceiling** on recoverable damages (limited to payments made).  
- Balances risk by allowing exceptions for severe misconduct.

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
The clause in question is **mutual**, not unilateral, because:  
1. **""The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party...""** implies that **both parties** are subject to the same cap when liable to each other.  
2. There is no language suggesting that only one party (e.g., the service provider or customer) is restricted while the other remains uncapped.  

### **Key Features of the Clause:**  
- **Standard Liability Cap:** Both parties' liability is capped at **[***]** (a specified amount).  
- **Exceptions to the Cap:** The cap does **not** apply to:  
  - Breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)  
  - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)  
  - Intentional misconduct or gross negligence  
- **Broad Definition of ""Liability"":** Encompasses all claims, damages, costs, attorney fees, etc., arising from the agreement.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This is a **mutual liability cap**, meaning both parties benefit from the same limitation unless an exception applies. If the query sought a **unilateral cap**, the clause would need to explicitly state that only one party's liability is limited (e.g., *""Customer’s liability to Provider shall be capped at [***], but Provider’s liability to Customer shall be unlimited""*).

9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The **""unilateral liability cap""** query refers to whether the limitation of liability clause imposes a cap on liability for only one party (unilateral) or both parties (mutual). 

### **Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Mutual Liability Cap (Not Unilateral):**  
   - The clause states **""The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party...""**, meaning **both parties** are subject to the same liability cap.  
   - This is a **mutual** (not unilateral) limitation, as it applies equally to both parties.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Still Mutual):**  
   - The cap does **not** apply to:  
     - **Confidentiality breaches (Section 5)**  
     - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**  
     - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**  
   - These exceptions apply to **both parties**, reinforcing the mutual nature of the clause.  

3. **Definition of Liability (Broad but Mutual):**  
   - The definition of ""liability"" is broad (covering contract, tort, statutory claims, etc.), but it applies **symmetrically** to both parties.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This is **not a unilateral liability cap**—it is a **mutual cap** with exceptions that apply equally to both parties. If the intent was to make it unilateral, the clause would explicitly state that only one party's liability is capped (e.g., ""**Supplier’s** maximum liability to **Customer**..."").

unilateral liability cap,395aab365a,"11.3. Liability Cap. Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The clause you provided (Section 11.3, ""Liability Cap"") is a **unilateral liability cap** because it limits the liability of **only one party** (in this case, the party receiving payments, likely **Accuray**) to the other party (the **Distributor**).  

### **Relevance to ""Unilateral Liability Cap"" Query:**  
1. **One-Sided Limitation**  
   - The clause caps the liability of **one party (Accuray)** to the **Distributor** based on the purchase prices paid in the preceding 12 months.  
   - It does **not** impose a reciprocal cap on the Distributor’s liability to Accuray, making it **unilateral**.  

2. **Exceptions Where the Cap Does Not Apply**  
   The cap **does not apply** to:  
   - Unauthorized use of **Intellectual Property** (IP breaches).  
   - **Intentional breaches or willful misconduct**.  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**.  
   This means liability remains **uncapped** for these scenarios.  

3. **Calculation of the Cap**  
   - The maximum liability is tied to the **purchase prices paid in the last 12 months**, minus any prior claims in that period.  
   - This ensures that liability is **proportional to the business volume** rather than open-ended.  

### **Why This Matters for a ""Unilateral Liability Cap"" Query**  
- If you are reviewing this from the **Distributor’s perspective**, this clause may be **unfavorable** because it restricts their ability to recover damages beyond a set amount, while their own liability may remain uncapped.  
- If you are **Accuray**, this clause **protects** you from excessive liability exposure while maintaining accountability for serious misconduct.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This is a **unilateral liability cap** because it **only limits one party’s liability** (Accuray’s) and does not provide a reciprocal limitation for the other party (Distributor).

Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause

AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The **""unilateral liability cap""** query refers to whether the liability limitation in the clause applies equally to both parties (bilateral) or disproportionately to one party (unilateral).  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Bilateral Cap (Not Unilateral):**  
   - The clause states that **both Fiserv and the Merchant** have their aggregate liability capped at AUD 50,000.00 (""Liability Cap"").  
   - This suggests a **mutual limitation**, meaning neither party can claim more than the cap from the other for general losses.  

2. **Exceptions (Where Cap Does Not Apply):**  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds (i.e., Fiserv must pay the Merchant in full for processed transactions).  
     - The Merchant’s payment obligations (e.g., fees, regulatory penalties).  
   - These exceptions **favor Fiserv** because:  
     - The Merchant remains fully liable for unpaid fees/penalties, while Fiserv’s only uncapped obligation is remitting transaction funds (a core function of the agreement).  

### **Conclusion:**  
While the **Liability Cap itself is bilateral**, the **exceptions create asymmetry**, effectively making the Merchant bear more uncapped liability than Fiserv. Thus, the clause is **not purely unilateral** but has a **one-sided effect** in practice.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### 1. **Liability Cap Structure**  
   - **Section 11.3** imposes a **monetary cap** on liability for breaches of the agreement, limiting it to the **aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray in the 12 months preceding a claim** (minus prior claims in that period).  
   - This is a **bilateral cap** (applying to both parties), but the **financial impact is effectively unilateral** because only the Distributor pays purchase prices (i.e., Accuray’s liability is capped at amounts it received, while the Distributor’s liability is capped at amounts it paid).  

### 2. **Exclusions from the Cap (Unlimited Liability Scenarios)**  
   The cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Unauthorized use of Intellectual Property** (IP breaches are uncapped).  
   - **Intentional breaches or willful misconduct** (bad-faith acts are uncapped).  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws** (regulatory violations are uncapped).  
   - **Strict product liability** (per Section 10, where applicable law imposes uncapped liability).  

### 3. **Exclusion of Consequential/Indirect Damages**  
   - **Section 10** broadly excludes liability for **special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or tort damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption), unless arising from the carve-outs above.  
   - This reinforces the unilateral nature of risk allocation: even if the liability cap applies, certain damages are **never recoverable** unless tied to IP, misconduct, or law.  

### **Why This Matters for ""Unilateral Liability Cap""**  
While the clause is phrased bilaterally, its **practical effect is unilateral**:  
- **Accuray’s liability** is capped at revenue received (a predictable, business-linked amount).  
- **Distributor’s liability** is technically capped but may face uncapped exposure for IP breaches or misconduct.  
- The **exclusions** ensure critical risks (like IP infringement or willful harm) remain fully actionable.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause balances risk by:  
1. Capping routine contractual breaches (protecting both parties).  
2. Imposing **asymmetric financial exposure** (due to the purchase-price-based cap).  
3. Preserving unlimited liability for high-stakes scenarios (IP, misconduct, legal violations).  

This structure is common in distribution agreements to **limit open-ended liability while safeguarding against egregious harms**. Would you like further analysis on enforceability or drafting alternatives?",5

The clause you provided (Section 9) is a **Limitation of Liability** clause that establishes such a mutual cap, making it directly relevant to your query. Here’s how:

### Key Aspects of the Clause Relevant to ""Mutual Liability Cap"":
1. **Mutual Cap**:  
   - The clause imposes a **shared limit** (""[***]"") on liability for both parties (""one Party to the other Party""). This ensures neither party faces unlimited exposure for claims arising from the agreement.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap does *not* apply to:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches** (Section 5): Unauthorized disclosures of confidential information can lead to uncapped liability.  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1): Claims covered by indemnity (e.g., third-party claims) are excluded from the cap.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**: Acts like fraud or reckless behavior are not protected by the cap.  

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""**:  
   The clause explicitly defines liability to include **all types of damages** (contract, tort, statutory, etc.), ensuring the cap applies comprehensively unless an exception is triggered.

### Why This Matters for ""Mutual Liability Cap"":  
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause balances risk by capping routine liabilities (e.g., ordinary breaches) while preserving recourse for egregious acts (e.g., gross negligence) or specific obligations (e.g., indemnification).  
- **Negotiation Point**: The cap amount (""[***]"") is typically negotiated based on factors like deal size, industry standards, and party bargaining power.  
- **Legal Enforceability**: The exclusions (e.g., for gross negligence) align with common law principles, where courts often refuse to enforce caps for intentional wrongdoing.  

In summary, this clause is a **mutual liability cap** with carefully carved-out exceptions, ensuring predictable risk exposure while addressing high-stakes scenarios.",5

The clause you provided (Section 9) is a **Limitation of Liability** clause that establishes such a mutual cap, making it directly relevant to your query. Here’s how it addresses the concept of a mutual liability cap:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Cap**  
   - The clause imposes a **single, agreed-upon cap (""Liability Cap"")** (denoted as `[***]` in the draft) that applies to **both parties equally**. This ensures neither party faces unlimited exposure for claims arising under the agreement.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The cap does **not** apply to:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches** (Section 5): Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information exposes a party to uncapped liability.  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1): Claims covered by indemnity (e.g., third-party claims) are excluded from the cap.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**: Acts like fraud or reckless behavior are not shielded by the cap.  

3. **Scope of ""Liability""**  
   The clause broadly defines liability to include **all types of damages** (contract, tort, statutory, etc.), ensuring the cap applies comprehensively unless an exception is triggered.

### Why This Matters for ""Mutual Liability Cap"":
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause ensures both parties share risk predictably by capping ordinary breaches (e.g., service failures) while reserving uncapped liability for high-risk scenarios (e.g., data leaks or willful harm).  
- **Negotiation Point**: The cap amount (`[***]`) is typically negotiated based on factors like contract value, industry standards, and party bargaining power.  
- **Legal Enforceability**: By excluding gross negligence/intentional acts, the clause aligns with common law principles that prohibit limiting liability for egregious conduct.  

### Practical Implications:
- A party seeking stronger protection might push for **exclusions** (e.g., adding IP infringement to the exceptions).  
- The mutual nature ensures **fairness**, as neither party can demand unlimited damages for routine breaches.  

In summary, this clause is a **balanced mutual liability cap** that limits exposure for typical contractual risks while preserving accountability for severe misconduct or specific obligations.",5
mutual liability cap,395aab365a,"11.3. Liability Cap.

The clause you provided (**Section 11.3**) is directly relevant to this concept, as it establishes a **liability cap** for claims arising from breaches of the agreement, with specific exceptions. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Cap**:  
   - The clause applies to **both parties** (e.g., Distributor and Accuray), limiting each party’s liability to the other.  
   - The cap is tied to the **aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor** for Products over the **12 months preceding the claim**. This creates a predictable, quantifiable limit for both sides.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap does **not** apply to:  
   - Liability for **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property** (IP breaches).  
   - Liability arising from **intentional breach or willful misconduct**.  
   - Liability for **non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**.  
   These carve-outs ensure that severe misconduct or legal violations remain fully actionable.

3. **Scope of Claims Covered**:  
   The cap applies to claims relating to:  
   - Breaches of the **main Agreement**,  
   - Breaches of **Purchase Orders** or **related agreements**,  
   - But excludes liabilities under the **Confidentiality Agreement** (per the reference to Section 10).  

### Relevance to ""Mutual Liability Cap"":
- **Reciprocity**: While the clause focuses on the Distributor’s payments (likely because it’s drafted from Accuray’s perspective), the structure implies mutuality—the same cap logic would protect both parties if liability flows in both directions.  
- **Balanced Risk Allocation**: By capping liability (except for egregious acts), the clause ensures neither party faces unlimited exposure, fostering commercial certainty.  
- **Temporal Limitation**: The 12-month lookback period ensures the cap reflects recent transactional activity, adjusting dynamically over time.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Predictability**: Both parties can assess their maximum exposure for standard breaches.  
- **Incentivizes Compliance**: The exceptions deter bad-faith behavior (e.g., willful misconduct).  
- **Negotiation Point**: Parties might debate the cap’s calculation (e.g., whether a longer/shorter period or different monetary base is fairer).  

In summary, this clause **operationalizes a mutual liability cap** with tailored exceptions, balancing protection for both parties while preserving accountability for serious breaches.",5
mutual liability cap,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause

AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","This clause is directly relevant to the query about a **mutual liability cap** because it establishes a shared (mutual) financial limit on the liability of both parties—Fiserv and the Merchant—under the agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Points:
1. **Mutual Cap**:  
   - The clause imposes an **identical liability limit (AUD 50,000)** on both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising from any cause related to the agreement. This ensures neither party is exposed to unlimited liability, creating a balanced risk allocation.

2. **Scope of Limitation**:  
   - The cap applies broadly to all claims (""regardless of the form of action or legal theory""), covering contractual breaches, negligence, or other legal grounds, unless explicitly exempted.

3. **Exclusions (Where the Cap Does Not Apply)**:  
   - The mutual cap **does not apply** to:  
     - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds to the Merchant (core payment obligation).  
     - The Merchant’s payment obligations (e.g., fees, regulatory penalties due to non-performance).  
   - These exclusions ensure critical obligations remain enforceable without the cap’s restriction.

### Relevance to ""Mutual Liability Cap"":
- The clause exemplifies a **bilateral limitation**, protecting both parties equally while carving out exceptions for essential duties.  
- It answers the query by showing how a mutual cap is structured: a shared financial ceiling with clear carve-outs to preserve accountability for high-priority obligations.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Management**: Both parties can assess their maximum exposure (AUD 50,000) for most disputes.  
- **Negotiation Insight**: The exclusions highlight areas where liability remains uncapped, which may require further negotiation or insurance coverage.  

In summary, this clause is a textbook example of a mutual liability cap with balanced protections and tailored exceptions.",5
mutual liability cap,0012758249,"Each Party shall obtain and maintain, for the Term (i) commercial general liability insurance with a single combined liability limit of at least $5,000,000 per occurrence, (ii) workers compensation/employer's liability insurance with a liability limit of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence or, if greater, the statutory minimum, and (iii) ""all risk"" property insurance on a replacement cost basis adequate to cover all assets and business interruption Losses that a Party may suffer in connection with or arising out of this Agreement, subject to policy limits, and in the case of the policies described in clause (i) above, naming the other Party as an additional insured thereunder.","The clause you provided outlines the insurance requirements that each party must maintain during the term of the agreement. While it does not explicitly mention a **mutual liability cap**, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

1. **Implied Liability Limits** – The clause sets minimum insurance coverage limits (e.g., $5M for general liability, $1M for workers' compensation), which indirectly function as a form of liability cap. If a claim arises, the insurance coverage acts as a financial safeguard, effectively capping each party's exposure up to the policy limits.  

2. **Risk Allocation** – By requiring both parties to maintain insurance and name each other as additional insureds, the clause ensures that both share the burden of potential liabilities. This mutual obligation helps balance risk exposure between the parties.  

3. **Indirect Cap on Uninsured Losses** – The ""all risk"" property insurance requirement further limits exposure by ensuring that property damage and business interruption losses are covered, reducing the likelihood of uncapped liability for such losses.  

However, this clause does **not** explicitly state a contractual liability cap (e.g., a dollar limit on total liability under the agreement). If the query seeks a strict **mutual liability cap**, additional language would be needed—such as:  
*""Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each Party’s aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed $[X].""*  

### Key Takeaway:  
The insurance clause **indirectly influences liability exposure** by mandating coverage limits, but it does not impose a direct contractual cap on liability. For a true **mutual liability cap**, a separate limitation of liability clause would be required.

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.","The query concerns **two parties having different liability caps and/or carveouts** in a contract. The provided **Limitation of Liability clause** is relevant because it:  

1. **Imposes Different Liability Caps**  
   - The clause generally limits both parties' liability by excluding **consequential, incidental, indirect, and lost profits damages** (a common mutual exclusion).  
   - However, it **specifically caps D2’s liability** at **""the total amount paid or owed by Licensee to D2 under this Agreement""**, while **no such cap is explicitly stated for the Licensee’s liability**.  
   - This creates an **asymmetrical liability structure**, where D2 has a defined financial limit, but the Licensee’s liability (for direct damages, for example) could remain uncapped unless restricted elsewhere in the agreement.  

2. **Carveouts (Implied or Missing)**  
   - The clause does **not** explicitly carve out exceptions (e.g., for gross negligence, willful misconduct, IP infringement, or breach of confidentiality), meaning such liabilities **may remain uncapped** for both parties unless addressed in another section.  
   - If the agreement elsewhere includes carveouts (e.g., ""Notwithstanding the above, liability for IP infringement shall not be limited""), this would further differentiate the parties' exposure.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause is **relevant to the query** because it:  
- **Treats the parties differently** by capping only D2’s liability (not the Licensee’s).  
- **Leaves carveouts unstated**, which could lead to gaps or unintended unlimited liability for certain claims.  

For a balanced or negotiated agreement, parties often:  
- Define **mutual caps** (e.g., both parties limited to fees paid).  
- Specify **carveouts** for high-risk scenarios (e.g., indemnities, breaches of core obligations).

The provided **Limitation of Liability clause (Section 13)** is relevant in the following ways:

### **1. Symmetrical vs. Asymmetrical Liability Caps**  
- The clause applies **equally to both parties** (""NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE""), meaning it is **symmetrical**—both parties have the same liability limitations.  
- If the parties wanted **different liability caps** (e.g., one party has a higher cap than the other), this clause would need modification to reflect that asymmetry.  

### **2. Carveouts (Exceptions to Liability Limits)**  
- The clause excludes **indirect, consequential, and punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits, lost revenues) for both parties.  
- However, it does **not** explicitly carve out exceptions for:  
  - **Direct damages** (which may still be recoverable unless capped elsewhere).  
  - **Specific liabilities** (e.g., IP infringement, gross negligence, fraud, or breach of confidentiality).  
- If one party wants **additional carveouts** (e.g., Supplier remains liable for data breaches, but Customer is not), those would need to be added.  

### **3. Interaction with Other Liability Provisions**  
- This clause is **only one part** of a broader liability framework.  
- A complete analysis would require reviewing:  
  - **Overall liability caps** (e.g., ""Each party’s total liability shall not exceed the fees paid under this Agreement"").  
  - **Specific carveouts** (e.g., ""Notwithstanding the above, Party A remains fully liable for indemnification claims"").  

### **Conclusion**  
The current clause **treats both parties equally** in excluding indirect/consequential damages but does **not** address:  
- Different monetary caps for each party.  
- Additional carveouts where liability remains uncapped.  
- Specific scenarios where one party assumes greater risk.  

If the parties want **different liability terms**, the clause should be revised to reflect those negotiated asymmetries.

- The clause is **broad** in its exclusions but does **not** explicitly carve out exceptions (e.g., for gross negligence, willful misconduct, IP infringement, or indemnified claims).  
- If the parties intend to have **different carveouts** (e.g., Party A remains liable for gross negligence, while Party B is fully protected), this clause would need modification to reflect those distinctions.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query:**  
- **Current Effect**: The clause **symmetrically limits** liability for both parties by excluding certain damage types but does **not** address:  
  - Monetary caps (so no differential caps exist).  
  - Carveouts (so neither party has exceptions for gross negligence, etc.).  
- **If Parties Want Different Terms**: The clause must be revised to:  
  - Specify **separate financial caps** for each party.  
  - Include **asymmetrical carveouts** (e.g., ""Notwithstanding the above, Party A remains liable for IP infringement, while Party B’s exclusions remain absolute"").  

### **Suggested Revision for Differential Treatment:**  
To implement different liability caps/carveouts, the clause could be amended with language such as:  
> *""Notwithstanding the foregoing, Party A’s total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed [X] dollars, except for claims arising from [specific carveouts, e.g., breach of confidentiality]. Party B’s liability shall not exceed [Y] dollars, with no exceptions for [listed categories].""*

EXCEPT UNDER SECTIONS 13(a) AND 13(b), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. EXCEPT UNDER SECTIONS 13(a) AND 13(b), THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR DAMAGES OR ALLEGED DAMAGES HEREUNDER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO, AND WILL NOT EXCEED, THE AMOUNTS TO BE PAID BY CLIENT TO EXCITE HEREUNDER.","This **Limitation of Liability (LOL) clause** is relevant to the query about **different liability caps and carveouts** in the following ways:  

### **1. Different Liability Caps**  
The clause imposes a **uniform liability cap** for both parties (""either party""), limiting liability to **""the amounts to be paid by Client to [Exciting] hereunder.""**  
- This suggests a **symmetrical cap** (same for both parties) based on fees paid under the contract.  
- However, if the **actual payments** between the parties differ (e.g., Client pays Exciting, but Exciting does not pay Client), the **effective cap** may differ in practice.  
- If the parties intended **asymmetrical caps**, this clause does not reflect that—it would need explicit differentiation (e.g., ""Exciting’s liability is capped at X, Client’s at Y"").  

### **2. Carveouts (Exceptions to Liability Limits)**  
The clause includes **two key carveouts** (exceptions where liability limits do not apply):  
- **Sections 13(a) & 13(b):** These sections (not provided here) likely cover **high-risk breaches** (e.g., indemnities, gross negligence, willful misconduct, IP infringement, or confidentiality breaches).  
- **Consequential Damages:** The clause excludes liability for **special, incidental, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) **unless** Sections 13(a) or 13(b) apply.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- If the parties want **different liability caps** (e.g., one party has a higher cap than the other), this clause does **not** achieve that—it would need revision.  
- If they want **different carveouts** (e.g., only one party is liable for certain breaches), this clause applies the same exceptions to both parties.  
- The clause is **neutral in allocation of risk**—if one party seeks **favorability**, amendments would be needed.  

### **Suggested Adjustments for Asymmetry**  
To reflect **different liability caps/carveouts**, the clause could be revised to:  
- **Different Caps:**  
  *""Exciting’s total liability shall not exceed [X]% of fees paid by Client; Client’s liability shall not exceed [Y]% of fees paid to Exciting.""*  
- **Different Carveouts:**  
  *""The limitations in this Section shall not apply to: (i) Client’s breach of payment obligations; or (ii) Exciting’s indemnification obligations under Section [X].""*

Except as provided by Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2) and (b)(iii)(3):
a) Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
b) Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **different liability caps and/or carveouts** because it structures the liability limitations asymmetrically (or symmetrically, depending on the context) while also introducing specific exceptions (""carveouts""). Here’s how it addresses the query:

### 1. **Differential Liability Caps**  
The clause imposes a **uniform monetary cap** on liability for both parties (""amounts actually paid by the other party""). However, if the amounts paid by each party differ (e.g., Party A pays $100K, Party B pays $50K), their liability caps would effectively be asymmetric. This creates a scenario where one party’s maximum exposure is higher than the other’s, even if the clause appears neutral at first glance.

### 2. **Carveouts to Liability Limits**  
The clause excludes certain liabilities from the cap entirely by referencing **Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2), and (b)(iii)(3)**. These carveouts likely cover high-risk scenarios (e.g., gross negligence, willful misconduct, IP infringement, or breaches of confidentiality). Importantly:  
   - If these carveouts apply **only to one party** (e.g., Party A’s indemnity obligations under Section 19 are broader than Party B’s), the liability regime becomes asymmetric.  
   - Even if carveouts apply to both, their **scope or financial impact** may differ (e.g., one party’s carveouts expose it to greater risk).

### 3. **Type of Damages**  
The clause excludes **consequential/indirect damages** for both parties, but the carveouts may override this for specific breaches. If the referenced sections in **Section 19** allow consequential damages for one party’s breaches but not the other’s, this creates further asymmetry.

### Key Implications for the Query:  
- **Explicit Symmetry**: The clause uses identical language for both parties (""Neither party,"" ""Either party’s liability""), suggesting equal treatment.  
- **Implicit Asymmetry**: If the **carveouts in Section 19** or the **actual payments** differ between parties, the practical liability exposure may be unequal.  
- **Drafting Intent**: The clause likely aims for fairness but allows for asymmetry if the underlying commercial terms (e.g., payment structures or Section 19 obligations) differ.  

### Recommendation for Review:  
To assess whether liability is truly balanced, you’d need to:  
1. Review **Section 19** to see if carveouts favor one party.  
2. Verify if **payment obligations** create uneven caps.  
3. Check whether **governing law** might interpret ""amounts actually paid"" differently for each party.  

This clause is a common template, but its real-world effect depends on the broader contract dynamics.",5
Cap on liability without carveouts,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause you provided is a **""Limitation of Liability""** provision with a **cap on liability (AUD 50,000.00)** but **includes carveouts (exceptions)** where the cap does not apply.  

### **Relevance to the Query: ""Cap on liability without carveouts""**  
1. **Cap on Liability** – The clause imposes a financial limit (AUD 50,000) on the total liability that either party (Fiserv or the Merchant) can claim from the other for losses arising from the agreement.  
2. **Carveouts (Exceptions to the Cap)** – The clause explicitly states that the liability cap **does not apply** to:  
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds to the Merchant.  
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations (e.g., fees, regulatory fines due to non-performance).  

### **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
- If the query seeks a **pure cap on liability without any exceptions**, this clause **does not fully meet that requirement** because it includes carveouts.  
- A **true ""cap without carveouts""** would mean **no exceptions**—the liability limit would apply universally to all claims under the agreement.

In no event shall CarMax be liable for loss of profits or revenue or for any incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages.","This clause is directly responsive to the query about a **""cap on liability without carveouts""** because it:  

1. **Imposes a Clear Cap on Liability**:  
   - CarMax's liability is explicitly limited to **the price allocable to the specific Products or Services** giving rise to the claim. This sets a strict financial ceiling on recoverable damages.  

2. **Excludes Broader Damages Without Carveouts**:  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, incidental, or punitive damages), regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, etc.).  
   - There are no exceptions (""carveouts"") for specific scenarios (e.g., gross negligence, willful misconduct, or IP infringement), which is typical in stricter liability caps.  

3. **Applies Universally to All Claims**:  
   - The language (""regardless of whether such liability arises in contract, tort... or otherwise"") ensures the cap applies across **all potential legal grounds**, leaving no ambiguity.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause enforces a **hard cap on liability** (tied to product/service value) and **does not include carveouts** for higher-risk conduct (e.g., intentional harm) or specific damage types. This favors CarMax by minimizing exposure, but may be seen as overly restrictive by counterparties.

Cap on liability without carveouts,e156a5b7c4,"28.2. Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The query asks about a **""cap on liability without carveouts""**, and the provided **Clause 28.2** is a **limitation of liability clause** that imposes a **financial cap** on recoverable damages while **excluding certain carveouts** (exceptions). Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### **1. Cap on Liability**  
The clause explicitly limits the maximum recoverable amount to:  
> *""an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.""*  

This means neither party can claim damages exceeding the total payments exchanged under the contract, regardless of the breach type (negligence, wilful misconduct, etc.).

### **2. ""Without Carveouts""**  
A carveout is an exception to the liability cap. The clause includes **only one carveout**:  
> *""Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by negligence (for which by law no limit applies).""*  

This is a **mandatory exception** (since liability for personal injury/death cannot be capped by law). Beyond this, there are **no other carveouts** (e.g., no exclusions for fraud, IP infringement, or breach of confidentiality). Thus, the clause is **largely ""without carveouts""** as it strictly limits liability for all other breaches.

### **3. Relevance to the Query**  
The clause fits the query because:  
- It **imposes a clear financial cap** (payments made under the Agreement).  
- It **excludes most carveouts**, except for the legally required exception for personal injury/death.  
- It applies broadly to **all breaches** (negligence, wilful misconduct, or otherwise), reinforcing the strict cap.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This is a **strong limitation of liability clause** favoring the party seeking protection, as it minimizes exposure to excessive claims while complying with mandatory legal exceptions. If the query seeks a **""pure"" cap without any carveouts**, this clause is close but not absolute (due to the personal injury exception). For a **fully carveout-free cap**, the personal injury exclusion would need removal—but that may be unenforceable under applicable law.

1. **Carveout for Confidentiality Breaches (Section 5)**: The cap does not apply to material breaches of confidentiality.  
2. **Carveout for Indemnification (Section 7.1)**: The cap does not apply to indemnification obligations (e.g., third-party claims).  
3. **Carveout for Intentional Misconduct/Gross Negligence**: The cap does not apply to deliberate wrongdoing or severe negligence.  

### Key Takeaway:
- This clause **does not match** the query's request for a liability cap **without carveouts**, as it explicitly excludes certain high-risk scenarios from the cap.  
- A true ""cap without carveouts"" would impose a strict monetary limit **regardless of the type of breach or misconduct**, which is **not the case here**.

2. **Identifies Carveouts (Exceptions)**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap **does not apply** to certain obligations, meaning these are **carved out** from the limitation. The carveouts include:

   - **The Merchant’s payment obligations** (e.g., fees, regulatory penalties, or other liabilities tied to the Services).  

### Why This Matters for ""Liability Cap Carveouts"":  
- **Risk Allocation**: The carveouts ensure critical obligations (like payment processing and regulatory compliance) are **not shielded** by the liability cap, protecting the non-breaching party from capped recovery in high-stakes scenarios.  
- **Regulatory/Contractual Safeguards**: By excluding regulatory penalties and payment duties, the clause prevents parties from avoiding liability for legal or financial defaults.  
- **Negotiation Insight**: A party reviewing this clause might seek to **expand or narrow carveouts** (e.g., adding fraud, IP infringement, or indemnities as exceptions).

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **""liability cap carveouts""** because it defines the circumstances under which the agreed **Liability Cap** (a limit on a party's financial exposure under the contract) **does not apply**. These exceptions are known as **carveouts**. Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### Key Carveouts to the Liability Cap:
1. **Material Breach of Confidentiality (Section 5)**  
   - If a party materially breaches its confidentiality obligations, the Liability Cap **will not protect them**—their liability could be uncapped (potentially unlimited).  
   - *Relevance to Query*: This is a classic carveout to ensure parties take confidentiality seriously.

2. **Indemnification Obligations (Section 7.1)**  
   - Claims covered by indemnity (e.g., third-party claims, IP infringement, or specific risks listed in Section 7.1) are **excluded from the cap**.  
   - *Relevance to Query*: Indemnities often have their own liability rules, and this carveout preserves their full enforceability.

3. **Intentional Misconduct or Gross Negligence**  
   - Acts done intentionally or with reckless disregard (gross negligence) **void the cap**.  
   - *Relevance to Query*: This prevents parties from evading accountability for egregious behavior.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause explicitly lists the **exceptions** (carveouts) where the Liability Cap is **ineffective**, answering the query about what types of liabilities remain uncapped.  
- It balances risk allocation: Routine contractual breaches are capped, but high-risk actions (like confidentiality breaches or gross negligence) face full exposure.  
- The broad definition of ""liability"" ensures the carveouts cover all forms of damages (contract, tort, statutory, etc.).

### Practical Implications:
- A party negotiating this clause might push to **narrow or expand carveouts** (e.g., adding fraud, willful default, or excluding certain indemnities).  
- The carveouts create **asymmetrical risk**: A party with sensitive data may insist on keeping confidentiality breaches uncapped, while another might resist uncapped indemnities.  

In summary, this clause is a **textbook example of liability cap carveouts**, clearly delineating where financial limits do and do not apply.",5

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **""liability cap carveouts""** as it establishes both the general limitation of liability (the ""Liability Cap"") and specific exceptions (carveouts) where the cap does not apply. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Liability Cap (General Limitation)**  
   - The clause sets a maximum liability amount ([***]) that one party can incur to the other party under the agreement.  
   - This cap applies broadly to liabilities arising from breaches, negligence, or other claims related to the agreement (as defined in Section 9.2).  

### 2. **Carveouts (Exceptions to the Liability Cap)**  
   The clause explicitly carves out certain scenarios where the Liability Cap **does not apply**, meaning liability in these cases could be uncapped (i.e., unlimited). The carveouts include:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches (Section 5)**: Material breaches of confidentiality obligations are excluded from the cap, emphasizing the importance of protecting sensitive information.  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**: Claims covered by indemnity (e.g., third-party claims, IP infringement, or specific negotiated risks) are not subject to the cap.  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**: Acts demonstrating reckless disregard or deliberate wrongdoing are excluded to deter bad behavior and align with legal norms.  

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - The clause answers the query by clearly defining **what is capped** (general liabilities) and **what is not** (carveouts).  
   - It reflects common contractual practices where parties agree to limit liability but exclude high-risk or egregious conduct from such limits.  
   - The carveouts ensure accountability for critical obligations (confidentiality, indemnity) and intentional/grossly negligent acts, balancing risk allocation between parties.  

### Key Takeaway  
This is a **standard but critical liability clause** with tailored carveouts, ensuring the cap doesn’t undermine protections for high-priority risks. Drafters should ensure carveouts align with the agreement’s risk profile (e.g., adding fraud, statutory violations, or specific indemnities if needed).",5

These carveouts specify situations where the liability cap does not apply, meaning a party could be exposed to **unlimited liability** in those cases.

### **Relevance of the Clause to Liability Cap Carveouts**  
The provided clause (28.2) includes both:  
1. **A general liability cap** – The recoverable amount for breaches (whether due to negligence, wilful misconduct, or otherwise) is limited to **the total payments made under the Agreement**.  
2. **A carveout** – The liability cap **does not apply** to claims for **personal injury or death caused by negligence** (where liability remains uncapped, as required by law).  

### **Key Takeaways for Liability Cap Carveouts**  
- **Standard Carveout:** Personal injury/death due to negligence is a common exception to liability caps, often mandated by law.  
- **Other Possible Carveouts:** While this clause only mentions personal injury, other contracts may carve out additional exceptions (e.g., fraud, wilful misconduct, IP infringement, or breach of confidentiality).  
- **Drafting Consideration:** If a party wants broader protection, they may push for fewer carveouts; conversely, the other party may demand more exceptions (e.g., for gross negligence or indemnities).

9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The query asks about a **""cap on liability subject to law,""** and the provided **Limitation of Liability clause (Section 9)** directly addresses this by:  

1. **Establishing a Liability Cap** – The clause sets a maximum monetary limit (""[***]"") on one party's liability to the other under the agreement, which aligns with the concept of a ""cap on liability.""  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap** – The clause clarifies that the cap **does not apply** in certain legally significant scenarios, such as:  
   - **Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)**  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**  
   These exceptions reflect legal principles where liability caps are often unenforceable (e.g., courts may refuse to enforce caps for fraud, willful acts, or statutory violations).  

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""** – The clause defines liability expansively (covering claims, damages, costs, etc., under contract, tort, or statute), ensuring the cap applies to most claims **unless overridden by law** (e.g., mandatory liability under consumer protection or employment laws).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause **implements a contractual cap on liability** while acknowledging legal boundaries—exempting scenarios where courts or statutes might invalidate such caps. It balances contractual risk allocation with compliance with underlying legal principles.  

**Key Takeaway:** The clause is ""subject to law"" because:  
- It respects common legal exclusions (e.g., gross negligence).  
- It avoids attempting to cap liability where the law prohibits it (e.g., certain statutory claims).  
- Its enforceability would depend on governing law and jurisdiction-specific rules.

1. **Imposing a Liability Cap** – The clause sets a maximum financial liability (denoted as [***]) that one party can owe the other under the agreement, except in specific carve-out scenarios.  

2. **Subject to Law** – While the clause enforces a contractual cap, it implicitly acknowledges that enforceability depends on applicable law. For example:  
   - Some jurisdictions may invalidate liability caps for certain types of harm (e.g., personal injury, fraud, or statutory violations).  
   - The carve-outs (e.g., for **gross negligence**, **intentional misconduct**, or **indemnification obligations**) reflect common legal exceptions where caps are often unenforceable.  

3. **Key Exclusions from the Cap** – The clause explicitly states the cap does **not** apply to:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches** (Section 5)  
   - **Indemnification claims** (Section 7.1)  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**  
   These exclusions align with typical legal standards where courts or statutes may refuse to enforce caps for egregious conduct or specific obligations.  

4. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""** – The clause covers all potential claims (contract, tort, statutory, etc.), but the cap’s enforceability remains subject to overriding legal principles (e.g., consumer protection laws or public policy limitations).  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause **contractually limits liability** but is **implicitly ""subject to law""** because:  
- Its enforceability depends on jurisdiction-specific rules (e.g., some states/countries prohibit caps for negligence or statutory rights).  
- The exclusions mirror common legal exceptions where caps are routinely challenged or invalidated.  

**Practical Implication:** While the parties agree to a cap, a court may disregard it if it conflicts with mandatory law (e.g., for willful acts or indemnification under public policy). Drafters should verify local law to ensure the cap’s validity.

Liability Cap""** is directly relevant to the query regarding a **""cap on liability subject to law""** because it establishes a financial limit (cap) on a party's liability for breaches of the agreement, while also acknowledging exceptions where such a cap may not apply due to legal or regulatory requirements.  

### **Key Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **General Liability Cap**  
   - The clause imposes a **monetary limit** on liability for most claims, restricting it to the **aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray in the preceding 12 months** (minus any prior claims in that period).  
   - This ensures that liability is **predictable and proportionate** to the business relationship rather than open-ended.  

2. **Exceptions Where the Cap Does Not Apply (Subject to Law)**  
   The clause explicitly **excludes** certain liabilities from the cap, particularly those that may be **mandated by law or involve serious misconduct**, including:  
   - **Unauthorized use of Intellectual Property (IP)** (likely because IP laws impose strict penalties).  
   - **Intentional breach or willful misconduct** (as courts may refuse to enforce liability caps in cases of bad faith).  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations** (ensuring the clause does not override statutory obligations).  

3. **Alignment with Legal Principles**  
   - The clause **respects mandatory legal requirements** by not limiting liability where doing so would violate applicable law (e.g., consumer protection laws, fraud, or statutory penalties).  
   - It ensures that the **cap is enforceable** by excluding scenarios where courts typically invalidate such limitations (e.g., gross negligence, intentional harm).  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause effectively **imposes a liability cap** while **acknowledging legal boundaries**—ensuring that the cap does not conflict with overriding laws or public policy. It balances **contractual risk allocation** with **compliance obligations**, making it a well-structured response to the query.

cap on liability subject to law,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The query asks about a **""cap on liability subject to law,""** and the provided clause (Section 11.4) addresses this directly by imposing a **monetary limit (AUD 50,000)** on the aggregate liability of both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising under the Agreement. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Explicit Cap on Liability**  
   The clause sets a clear financial limit (AUD 50,000) for claims between the parties, which is the core of a ""cap on liability."" This protects both parties from unlimited exposure to damages.

2. **Subject to Law** (Implied)  
   While the clause does not explicitly state ""subject to applicable law,"" such limitations are inherently governed by legal enforceability. For example:
   - **Mandatory Laws**: If local law prohibits liability caps (e.g., for gross negligence, fraud, or statutory consumer protections), the cap may be overridden.
   - **Unconscionability**: Courts may strike down caps deemed unreasonable or oppressive under contract law principles.

3. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The clause carves out scenarios where the cap **does not apply**, such as:
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds (a core contractual duty).
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations (ensuring Fiserv’s fees and regulatory liabilities are fully covered).  
   These exceptions reflect areas where the law or practical business needs may demand uncapped liability.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause **attempts** to limit liability contractually, but its enforceability depends on **governing law** and jurisdiction-specific rules (e.g., Australian Consumer Law may invalidate caps for certain breaches).  
- A court might assess whether the cap is **reasonable** or conflicts with public policy (e.g., for essential services like payment processing).  

### Drafting Note:
To align more explicitly with the query, the clause could include language like:  
*""This limitation applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and does not affect liabilities that cannot lawfully be limited.""*

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.","The query asks about a **""cap on liability subject to law,""** and the provided **Limitation of Liability clause** addresses this directly. Here’s how the clause aligns with the query:

### 1. **Cap on Liability**  
The clause explicitly states:  
> *""IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.""*  

This imposes a **monetary cap** on D2’s liability, limiting it to the total fees paid/owed by the Licensee under the contract. This is a classic example of a contractual liability cap.

### 2. **Exclusions (Subject to Law)**  
The clause excludes certain types of damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential, indirect damages) but includes the qualifier:  
> *""HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY.""*  

This broad language attempts to cover all legal theories (e.g., contract, tort, statute), but its enforceability is **subject to applicable law**. For example:  
- Some jurisdictions may invalidate exclusions of liability for **gross negligence, willful misconduct, or statutory violations** (e.g., consumer protection laws).  
- Courts may strike down limitations if they are deemed **unconscionable** or against public policy.  

### 3. **""Subject to Law"" Implications**  
The clause does not explicitly state ""subject to law,"" but its enforceability inherently depends on governing law. For instance:  
- Under the **UCC (U.S.) or common law**, exclusions of consequential damages may be upheld unless unreasonable.  
- In the **EU**, liability for death/personal injury or fraud cannot be excluded.  
- **Civil law jurisdictions** (e.g., Germany) often impose stricter limits on liability exclusions.  

### Key Relevance to the Query  
The clause **imposes a cap on liability** (aligned with the query) but is implicitly **subject to legal limits** based on jurisdiction and context. A party relying on this clause must ensure it complies with mandatory laws to avoid unenforceability.  

#### Suggested Refinement (if drafting):  
To explicitly address ""subject to law,"" consider adding:  
> *""The limitations in this Section 11 shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.""*  

This reinforces that the cap/exclusions are not absolute and acknowledges legal constraints.

compliance with law carveout to cap on liability,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The query asks about a **""compliance with law carveout to cap on liability""**—meaning whether the limitation of liability clause includes an exception (carveout) for breaches related to legal or regulatory compliance.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query**  
The **Limitation of Liability (Section 11.4)** clause imposes a general cap (AUD 50,000) on Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s liability but includes two key carveouts:  

1. **Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds** (after offsets).  
2. **The Merchant’s payment obligations**, including:  
   - Fees for Services and Network Security Fees.  
   - **Amounts imposed by a regulatory authority due to a party’s failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement.**  

### **Compliance with Law Carveout**  
The second carveout (regulatory authority-imposed amounts) is directly relevant to the query because it **excludes liability from the cap when a party fails to comply with legal/regulatory obligations under the Agreement.**  

- If Fiserv or the Merchant breaches a legal/regulatory duty (e.g., data protection laws, anti-money laundering rules), and a regulator imposes fines or penalties, **those amounts are not subject to the AUD 50,000 cap.**  
- This ensures that liability for **legal non-compliance remains uncapped**, incentivizing adherence to laws.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **does include a compliance-with-law carveout** by explicitly stating that regulatory-imposed amounts (due to a party’s failure to perform obligations) are excluded from the liability cap. This protects both parties from being shielded by the cap when their actions (or inactions) result in legal or regulatory penalties.

Here’s the breakdown of its relevance:

1. **General Liability Cap (Section 9.1)**  
   - The clause sets a monetary cap (""Liability Cap"") on the liability of either party under the Agreement.  
   - This cap broadly covers all liabilities arising from the Agreement, whether in contract, tort, statute, etc.  

2. **Carveouts to the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1 and 9.1.2)**  
   - The clause includes **specific exceptions** where the Liability Cap **does not apply**, which aligns with the concept of a ""carveout."" These carveouts ensure that certain high-risk or wrongful conduct remains fully actionable.  
     - **Material confidentiality breaches (Section 5)**: Unrestricted liability applies for serious breaches of confidentiality.  
     - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**: Indemnity claims (e.g., third-party claims) are excluded from the cap, ensuring full protection for indemnified losses.  
     - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**: Liability is uncapped for deliberate or egregious wrongdoing.  

3. **Implicit Compliance with Law**  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention ""compliance with law"" as a carveout, the exceptions (e.g., indemnification, gross negligence) often overlap with statutory or regulatory liabilities that cannot be contractually limited under applicable law.  
   - For example:  
     - Some jurisdictions prohibit limiting liability for gross negligence or intentional harm.  
     - Indemnification obligations may include liabilities imposed by law (e.g., IP infringement, data protection violations).  

4. **Scope of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**  
   - The broad definition of ""liability"" ensures the cap and carveouts apply comprehensively, covering statutory claims unless otherwise exempted.  

### Why This Answers the Query  
The clause demonstrates how a **limitation of liability provision** can include **carveouts** for scenarios where contractual caps would conflict with legal or equitable principles (e.g., misconduct, indemnification, confidentiality breaches). While it does not explicitly state ""compliance with law,"" the carveouts implicitly address situations where liability cannot be capped under governing law.  

If the query seeks to add an **express ""compliance with law"" carveout**, the clause could be amended to explicitly exclude statutory/regulatory violations (e.g., ""The Liability Cap shall not apply to liabilities arising from a Party’s failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations"").

### Relevance to the Query:
The **Limitation of Liability** clause (Section 9) includes carveouts (exceptions) to the Liability Cap, but it does **not explicitly mention ""compliance with law"" or statutory violations** as an exception. Here’s how the clause relates to the query:

1. **General Cap on Liability**:  
   - The Liability Cap ([***]) limits most liabilities arising under the Agreement (Section 9.2).  

2. **Carveouts (Exceptions) to the Cap**:  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches** (Section 5)  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1)  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2)  

3. **Missing Carveout for Legal Compliance**:  
   - The clause does **not** expressly exclude liability for **violations of law** (e.g., statutory fines, regulatory penalties, or damages from non-compliance).  
   - If a party’s breach of law involves **gross negligence or intentional misconduct**, it may fall under Section 9.1.2. Otherwise, statutory liabilities could still be **capped** unless another section (e.g., indemnification) covers them.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause does **not** include a broad carveout for ""compliance with law."" Depending on the jurisdiction and context, this could leave parties exposed to uncapped liability for legal violations **only if** they involve:  
- A breach of confidentiality (Section 5),  
- An indemnified claim (Section 7.1), or  
- Gross negligence/intentional misconduct (Section 9.1.2).

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
The provided **Limitation of Liability** clause (Section 16.15) broadly limits both parties' liability for:  
- **Consequential, incidental, indirect, or special damages**  
- **Punitive, exemplary, treble, or similar damages**  

However, it **does not explicitly include a carveout for liability resulting from non-compliance with applicable laws** (e.g., statutory violations, regulatory breaches, or illegal conduct).  

### **Key Observations:**  
1. **Indemnification Exception:** The clause explicitly **excludes** indemnification obligations for third-party claims from the liability cap. If a party's breach of law leads to a third-party claim, indemnification may still apply.  
2. **No Direct ""Compliance with Law"" Carveout:** Unlike some contracts, this clause does **not** state that liability limitations are void if a party violates applicable laws.  
3. **Potential Legal Override:** Even without an explicit carveout, **mandatory laws** (e.g., fraud, willful misconduct, or statutory penalties) may **override** contractual liability limits under certain jurisdictions.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause **does not expressly include a compliance-with-law carveout**, meaning liability for statutory/regulatory breaches could still be limited unless:  
- The law itself prohibits such limitations (e.g., antitrust, data privacy, or employment laws).  
- A court deems the limitation unenforceable for public policy reasons.  

If the parties want to ensure liability remains uncapped for legal violations, they should **add an explicit carveout** (e.g., *""Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement limits liability arising from a party’s breach of applicable law.""*).

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
The clause **does contain a carveout for situations where the law prohibits limiting liability**. Specifically:  

1. **Explicit Legal Carveout for Personal Injury/Death:**  
   - The clause states that the liability cap **does not apply** to ""personal injury or death caused by negligence"" because **the law does not permit liability limits in such cases**.  
   - This is a **mandatory legal exception**, ensuring the clause complies with statutory or common law principles that prohibit capping liability for personal harm.  

2. **No General Compliance with Law Carveout:**  
   - The clause **does not** explicitly state a broader carveout for other legal requirements (e.g., fraud, gross negligence, or statutory liabilities beyond personal injury/death).  
   - If other laws (e.g., consumer protection, antitrust, or data privacy laws) impose **uncapped liability**, this clause **may not automatically override them** unless the agreement includes a broader **""compliance with law"" exception**.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **partially addresses** the query by carving out liability for personal injury/death where the law prohibits limits. However, it **does not explicitly extend** to all legal requirements that might invalidate liability caps. If the parties want broader protection against unenforceable caps, they should consider adding a general **""subject to applicable law""** or **""except where prohibited by law""** provision.

Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Indemnification Carveout**  
   - The clause carves out (excludes) indemnification obligations (Section 7.1) from the Liability Cap. This means that:  
     - Claims covered by indemnification (e.g., third-party claims, IP infringement, or other specified liabilities in Section 7.1) are **not subject to the [***] cap**.  
     - The indemnifying party’s liability for such obligations could be **uncapped** or subject to a separate limit (if any) defined in the indemnification section.  

2. **Other Carveouts to the Liability Cap**  
   The clause also excludes:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches** (Section 5): Liability for material breaches of confidentiality is uncapped.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**: These acts are typically excluded from liability limits as a matter of public policy or fairness.  

3. **Scope of ""Liability""**  
   The broad definition of ""liability"" (claims, costs, damages, etc.) ensures the cap and its carveouts apply comprehensively across all types of legal theories (contract, tort, statute, etc.).  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- The clause **prioritizes indemnification obligations** by ensuring they are not constrained by the general cap, which aligns with common contractual risk allocation strategies (e.g., protecting against third-party claims).  
- It balances risk by capping routine liabilities (e.g., ordinary breaches) while **preserving full exposure for high-stakes scenarios** (indemnification, confidentiality, and bad-faith acts).  

### Drafting Note:  
If the query seeks to *modify* this carveout, parties might negotiate:  
- Adding sub-limits for indemnification (e.g., a higher but still capped amount).  
- Narrowing the carveout (e.g., excluding certain types of indemnified claims).  
- Clarifying if indemnification obligations are subject to separate terms (e.g., ""sole remedy"" provisions).

You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel.

You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The query asks about an **""indemnification carveout to cap on liability.""** Here’s how the clause (Section 14.4) is relevant to this concept:

### **1. Indemnification Scope vs. Liability Cap**  
The clause imposes a broad indemnification obligation on the franchisee (""You"") to cover losses incurred by the franchisor (""Indemnitees"") arising from the franchisee’s operations, including legal fees, damages, and settlements. However, it **carves out liability for the Indemnitees' gross negligence** (except in cases of joint liability).  

- **Carveout:** The indemnification does not apply to liabilities caused by the Indemnitees' **gross negligence**, meaning the franchisor cannot force the franchisee to cover losses stemming from the franchisor’s own egregious misconduct.  
- **No Explicit Cap:** While the clause does not mention a monetary cap on indemnification liability, the carveout functionally limits the franchisee’s exposure by excluding indemnification for the franchisor’s gross negligence.  

### **2. Relevance to ""Cap on Liability""**  
- If the contract elsewhere includes a **general cap on liability** (e.g., a monetary limit on damages), this indemnification clause **operates alongside it** but is not itself a cap.  
- The carveout ensures that even if the franchisee’s indemnification obligation is otherwise unlimited, they are **not liable for the franchisor’s gross negligence**, which acts as a partial limitation.  

### **3. Key Takeaways**  
- The clause **broadly shifts risk** to the franchisee but **carves out gross negligence** as a limit.  
- It does not impose a monetary cap but **mitigates unlimited liability** by excluding certain franchisor misconduct.  
- If the contract has a separate liability cap, this indemnification provision would apply **up to that cap**, except where the carveout applies.  

Thus, the clause is relevant to the query because it **creates a carveout to indemnification** (excluding gross negligence) but does not itself impose a monetary cap—unless one exists elsewhere in the agreement.

9 Limitation of Liability.
9.1 The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party and its affiliates in relation to this Agreement will be [***] (""Liability Cap""), provided however that:
9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","This clause directly addresses the query about an **indemnification carveout to a cap on liability** by explicitly stating that the general limitation of liability (the ""Liability Cap"") does **not** apply to certain exceptions, including indemnification obligations. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Liability Cap (General Rule)**:  
   - Section 9.1 sets a maximum liability limit (""[***]"") for claims arising under the Agreement.  

2. **Indemnification Carveout (Exception)**:  
   - Section 9.1.1 explicitly **excludes** indemnification obligations (under Section 7.1) from the Liability Cap. This means:  
     - If a party incurs liability due to indemnification (e.g., third-party claims covered by Section 7.1), the cap **does not apply**, and the indemnifying party’s liability could exceed the agreed limit.  

3. **Other Carveouts**:  
   - The clause also carves out **confidentiality breaches** (Section 5) and **intentional misconduct/gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2), but these are separate from the indemnification exception.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause demonstrates a common contractual structure where:  
- A general liability cap is imposed to limit risk.  
- **Indemnification obligations are carved out** from that cap, ensuring the indemnifying party remains fully liable for covered claims (e.g., third-party lawsuits).  

This protects the indemnified party by ensuring they can recover **uncapped** amounts for indemnifiable claims, even if other liabilities under the Agreement are limited.  

**Key Takeaway**: The indemnification carveout ensures that the Liability Cap does not undermine the parties’ agreed risk allocation for third-party claims or other indemnified matters.",5
indemnification carveout to cap on liability,eb935e4d2e,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits.

12.4 Limitation on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The query concerns an **""indemnification carveout to cap on liability,""** which refers to whether indemnification obligations are excluded from (or ""carved out"" of) a general limitation of liability clause in a contract.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **General Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - The clause imposes a **maximum aggregate liability cap** (e.g., $[* * *]) for all claims, whether in contract, tort, negligence, or otherwise.  
   - This cap would normally apply broadly to **all liabilities** under the agreement.  

2. **Indemnification Carveout (Section 12.3 & 12.4)**  
   - **Section 12.3** explicitly states that the **limitation on consequential damages** (e.g., indirect, special, lost profits) **does not apply to indemnification obligations** (""This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other..."").  
   - **Section 12.4** reinforces this by stating that the **aggregate liability cap applies ""whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions.""** This suggests that indemnification claims **are subject to the cap** unless an exception applies.  

### **Interpretation:**  
- The clause **partially carves out indemnification from liability limitations** but in a nuanced way:  
  - **Indemnifiable Losses are exempt from the exclusion of consequential damages** (Section 12.3).  
  - However, **indemnification claims may still be subject to the overall liability cap** (Section 12.4), unless another provision (e.g., a separate indemnification section) overrides this.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
The clause **does not fully exempt indemnification from the liability cap** but ensures that indemnifiable losses (e.g., third-party claims) are not barred just because they include consequential damages. The **aggregate cap in 12.4 likely still applies** unless contradicted elsewhere in the agreement.  

For a true **""carveout,""** the contract would need clearer language (e.g., ""Notwithstanding Section 12.4, indemnification obligations shall not be subject to the liability cap""). Without such language, indemnification claims may still be capped.

Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The query concerns an **""indemnification carveout to cap on liability,""** which refers to whether indemnification obligations are excluded (carved out) from a general limitation of liability clause in a contract.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **General Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - The clause imposes a **maximum aggregate liability cap** (e.g., $[* * *]) for all claims, whether in contract, tort, negligence, or otherwise.  
   - This cap would normally apply broadly to all claims under the agreement.  

2. **Indemnification Carveout (Section 12.3 & 12.4)**  
   - **Section 12.3** states that the **exclusion of indirect/consequential damages does not apply to indemnification obligations** (i.e., indemnifiable losses are still recoverable even if they include consequential damages).  
   - **Section 12.4** includes the phrase **""whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12,""** which suggests that the **liability cap applies even to indemnification claims**—unless there is an explicit carveout.  

### **Interpretation:**  
- The clause **does not fully carve out indemnification from the liability cap**—instead, it **subjects indemnification claims to the same cap** as other claims.  
- However, **indemnifiable losses can still include consequential damages** (per Section 12.3), meaning that while indemnification claims are capped, they are not restricted by the **type** of damages (unlike non-indemnity claims).  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
This clause **does not fully exempt indemnification from the liability cap** but ensures that indemnifiable losses can include consequential damages (which would otherwise be excluded under Section 12.3). If the parties intended a full carveout, the language would need to explicitly state that indemnification obligations are **excluded from the liability cap** in Section 12.4.

1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party is liable for **indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, goodwill) **unless** the liability arises from IP infringement (Section 9.3).  
   - This means that for IP infringement claims, the injured party **can** seek these broader categories of damages, which would otherwise be excluded.

2. **Monetary Cap on Liability**:  
   - The clause imposes a general cap on liability, limiting each party's total liability to the amount they earned under the **Revenue Sharing provisions (Section 5.4)** in the **12 months preceding the claim**.  
   - However, this cap **does not apply** to liability stemming from IP infringement (Section 9.3). Thus, claims related to IP infringement could expose a party to **uncapped liability** (i.e., damages may exceed the revenue-sharing limit).  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **exempts IP infringement claims** from both:  
- The **exclusion of consequential/punitive damages**, and  
- The **monetary cap on liability**.  

This means IP infringement claims are treated more severely under the contract, allowing the aggrieved party to pursue **full damages** (including indirect or punitive damages) without being restricted by the revenue-sharing cap.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   The clause states that, under normal circumstances, a party's total liability for claims arising from breaches of the agreement is capped at the aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray in the **12 months preceding the claim notification**.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap **does not apply** to three specific scenarios, one of which is **(i) liability relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property**. This means:  
   - If a party is found liable for **IP infringement** (e.g., unauthorized use of patents, copyrights, or trademarks), their liability is **uncapped** and could exceed the standard monetary limit.  
   - The other exceptions (willful misconduct/intentional breach and non-compliance with laws) are also uncapped, but the focus here is on IP.

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   The clause confirms that **IP infringement claims are treated differently** from ordinary breaches under the agreement. While most liabilities are limited, IP-related breaches expose the liable party to **potentially unlimited damages**, depending on the severity of the infringement and applicable law.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause ensures that **IP infringement cannot be shielded by the liability cap**, protecting the IP owner (likely Accuray) from being restricted to a limited recovery in case of misuse. This is critical for safeguarding proprietary rights and deterring unauthorized use.

Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### Key Points:
1. **IP Infringement Exception to Liability Cap**  
   - Both **Section 10 (Indemnities)** and **Section 11.3 (Liability Cap)** exclude breaches related to **unauthorized use of IP** from the limitations on liability.  
   - This means that if a party is liable for IP infringement (e.g., unauthorized use of patents, copyrights, or trademarks), the **cap on damages** (which otherwise limits liability to the aggregate purchase prices paid over 12 months) **does not apply**. The liable party could face **uncapped damages** for such breaches.

2. **Other Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The clause also highlights other scenarios where the liability cap does not apply, including:  
   - **Intentional breaches or willful misconduct** (e.g., deliberate IP theft).  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws** (e.g., statutory IP protections).  

3. **Types of Damages Excluded (Unless IP is Involved)**  
   - The general limitation excludes **special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or tort damages** (e.g., lost profits, business disruption) **unless** the claim involves IP infringement, intentional misconduct, or legal violations.  

### Why This Matters for IP Infringement:  
- **IP breaches are treated more severely** than ordinary contractual breaches under this agreement.  
- A party sued for IP infringement could be exposed to **full damages** (not just the capped amount), including **consequential or punitive damages**, which would otherwise be excluded.  
- This aligns with common legal practices where IP violations often carry **higher risks** due to statutory penalties (e.g., under copyright or patent law) and the potential for significant harm.  

### Practical Implications:  
- A distributor using a supplier’s IP without authorization could face **uncapped liability**, even if other breaches (e.g., late delivery) are subject to the cap.  
- The clause incentivizes parties to **avoid IP misuse** by removing financial safeguards that apply to ordinary breaches.  

In summary, the clause explicitly **excludes IP infringement from liability limitations**, ensuring that IP-related breaches remain fully actionable without the protection of the contractual cap.",5

Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind. This Section shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.","The clause **""16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY""** is directly relevant to the query regarding an **""IP infringement exception to the cap on liability""** because it explicitly carves out an exception for intellectual property (IP) infringement claims from the general limitation of liability.  

### Key Points:  
1. **General Limitation of Liability**  
   - The clause states that, in most cases, neither party will be liable for **special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages**.  
   - This means that damages like lost profits, reputational harm, or other non-direct losses are typically excluded.  

2. **Exception for IP Infringement**  
   - The clause makes a clear exception for **""any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third-party intellectual property right.""**  
   - This means that if one party is sued for IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations), the limitation of liability **does not apply**, and the infringing party could be held fully liable for all damages, including indirect or consequential losses.  

3. **Survival Clause**  
   - The provision remains in effect even after the agreement ends, ensuring that IP infringement claims can still be pursued post-termination.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- If a party is concerned about **uncapped liability for IP infringement**, this clause confirms that IP claims are **not subject to the usual liability cap**.  
- Businesses should assess their IP risks (e.g., software licensing, patented technology) since infringement claims could expose them to **greater financial liability** than other breaches.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Points:
1. **IP Infringement Exception to Liability Cap**  
   - **Section 11.3 (Liability Cap)** states that the cap on liability **does not apply** to breaches involving the unauthorized use of IP (clause (i)).  
   - This means if one party infringes the other’s IP (e.g., unauthorized use of patents, trademarks, or copyrights), the liable party’s financial responsibility is **not limited** to the capped amount (which would otherwise be tied to purchase prices over 12 months).  
   - The infringing party could be exposed to **full liability** for damages, including direct, indirect, or consequential losses arising from the IP breach.

2. **Exclusion of Certain Damages (Section 10)**  
   - While Section 10 generally excludes liability for **special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages**, this exclusion **does not apply** to IP breaches.  
   - Thus, IP infringement claims may include **recovery of these broader damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or statutory penalties), which would otherwise be barred under the standard limitation.

3. **Alignment with Other Exceptions**  
   - The IP exception is grouped with other carve-outs (e.g., **willful misconduct** or **violations of law**), emphasizing that IP breaches are treated as **high-risk violations** warranting uncapped liability.  
   - This reflects the parties’ intent to **deter IP misuse** and ensure full recourse for IP owners.

### Practical Implications:
- **IP breaches are treated more severely** than ordinary contract breaches.  
- A party accused of unauthorized IP use cannot rely on the liability cap (Section 11.3) or the exclusion of consequential damages (Section 10) to limit exposure.  
- The clause incentivizes compliance with IP rights by removing financial safeguards for infringers.

### Summary:
The clause explicitly **excludes IP infringement from liability limitations**, ensuring that IP-related claims are not subject to the agreement’s standard caps or exclusions. This creates a significant financial risk for parties that misuse the other’s IP.",5

1. **Exclusion of IP Infringement from Liability Cap**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the **limitations on liability (including the monetary cap)** do **not** apply to claims arising from **Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)**.
   - This means that if a third party sues for IP infringement (e.g., copyright, patent, or trademark violations), the liable party’s financial responsibility is **not restricted** by the general cap (which limits liability to the amount earned under **Section 5.4** in the preceding 12 months).

2. **Uncapped Liability for IP Infringement**  
   - While the agreement generally limits liability to indirect, consequential, and punitive damages, **IP infringement claims are carved out** from this restriction.
   - Thus, if a third party alleges IP infringement, the responsible party could be liable for **full damages** (including direct losses, legal costs, or injunctive relief), regardless of the revenue-sharing cap.

3. **Implications for Third-Party Claims**  
   - If a third party (not a party to the contract) asserts an IP infringement claim, the clause ensures that the liable party cannot hide behind the **monetary cap** in **Section 9.4**.
   - This exception protects the non-infringing party from being unfairly limited in recovering losses caused by the other party’s IP violations.

### **Summary**  
The clause confirms that **third-party IP infringement claims are exempt from the liability cap**, meaning the at-fault party could face **unlimited financial exposure** for such claims, unlike other types of liability under the agreement. This ensures stronger accountability for IP-related breaches.",5
third party IP infringement exception to cap on liability,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","This clause is directly relevant to the query about a **third-party IP infringement exception to a cap on liability** because it explicitly carves out an exception for claims or liabilities arising from third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement. Here’s how it works:

1. **General Cap on Liability**: The clause states that, in general, neither party will be liable for certain types of damages (e.g., indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages). This is a typical limitation of liability provision meant to cap exposure for broad or unpredictable losses.

2. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement**: The clause makes an exception for claims or liabilities **arising from third-party IP infringement**. This means:
   - If one party is sued by a third party for IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark infringement) due to the other party’s actions or deliverables under the contract, the **limitation of liability does not apply** to such claims.
   - The party responsible for the infringement could still be held fully liable for all damages (including indirect, consequential, or punitive damages) related to the IP claim, even if the contract otherwise limits liability for other types of claims.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause explicitly addresses the scenario where a **third party asserts an IP infringement claim**, ensuring that the standard cap on liability does not protect the party responsible for the infringement.
- This exception is critical because IP infringement claims often involve significant risks (e.g., lawsuits, injunctions, or statutory damages) that parties may not want to limit contractually.

Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The clause **11.3 (Liability Cap)** is directly relevant to the query regarding a **""third-party IP infringement exception to the cap on liability""** because it explicitly carves out certain exceptions where the liability cap **does not apply**.  

### Key Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Exception for IP Infringement (Subsection (i))**  
   - The clause states that the liability cap **does not apply** to claims related to **""unauthorized use of Intellectual Property.""**  
   - This means that if a third party (e.g., a patent holder) sues one party for IP infringement (e.g., due to the other party’s unauthorized use of third-party IP), the **liability cap would not protect the infringing party**—their liability could be **uncapped** (i.e., potentially unlimited).  
   - This ensures that IP infringement risks (including third-party claims) are treated as a **high-stakes exception**, not subject to the usual financial limits.  

2. **Other Exceptions Reinforcing the Severity of IP Misuse**  
   - The clause also excludes **intentional breaches/willful misconduct (ii)** and **non-compliance with laws (iii)** from the cap, further emphasizing that **serious misconduct (including IP violations)** is not shielded by contractual liability limits.  

### Why This Matters for Third-Party IP Infringement:  
- If a third party (e.g., a patent troll or competitor) alleges that products supplied under the agreement infringe their IP, the **distributor or Accuray could face uncapped liability** for damages, legal costs, or injunctions.  
- The clause **shifts significant risk** to the party responsible for the infringement (e.g., if Accuray supplied infringing products, it could not rely on the liability cap to limit exposure).  

### Practical Implication:  
- Parties must ensure **strong IP warranties/indemnities elsewhere in the agreement** (e.g., in an IP clause) to address third-party claims, since this clause only confirms that liability for IP breaches **is not capped**.  

In summary, **Section 11.3(i)** explicitly prevents a party from invoking the liability cap for third-party IP infringement claims, making it a critical consideration in IP risk allocation.",5
third party IP infringement exception to cap on liability,0bb5a9f842,"16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind. This Section shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.","The query asks about the **exception to the cap on liability** for **third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement** in the given clause. Here’s how the clause addresses this:

1. **General Limitation of Liability**:  
   The clause states that, **except for claims arising from third-party IP infringement**, neither party will be liable for **special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages**. This means most types of damages are capped or excluded—**unless** the claim involves IP infringement by a third party.

2. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement**:  
   The clause **explicitly carves out** liability related to third-party IP infringement from the general limitation. This means:  
   - If a claim arises because one party’s actions (e.g., using unlicensed software or content) infringe a third party’s IP rights (e.g., copyright, patent, trademark), the **limitation on liability does not apply**.  
   - The injured party could potentially seek **full damages** (including indirect, consequential, or other types typically excluded) for such claims.  

3. **Survival Clause**:  
   The provision remains enforceable even after the agreement ends, ensuring ongoing exposure to liability for IP infringement claims that may arise post-termination.  

### **Relevance to the Query**:  
The clause answers the query by confirming that **third-party IP infringement claims are treated differently**—they are **exempt from the liability cap** that applies to other types of claims. This exception reflects the higher risk and potential severity of IP disputes, which often involve statutory damages, injunctions, or significant legal exposure.  

**Key Takeaway**: While the contract limits liability for most breaches, parties remain **fully liable for IP infringement claims**, preserving the right to recover broader damages in such cases.",5

Here’s how the clause is relevant:

### Key Points:
1. **Exception to Liability Cap for IP Infringement (Section 11.3)**  
   - The liability cap in **Section 11.3** limits a party’s total liability to the aggregate purchase prices paid in the **12 months preceding a claim**.  
   - However, this cap **does not apply** to breaches involving **""unauthorized use of Intellectual Property""** (clause (i)).  
   - This means if a party is sued for third-party IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations), their liability is **uncapped**—they could be liable for **full damages**, not just the limited amount under the cap.

2. **Confirmation in Indemnity Section (Section 10)**  
   - Section 10 reinforces that **consequential, punitive, and other damages** are generally excluded **except** for breaches tied to **unauthorized IP use**.  
   - Thus, third-party IP infringement claims could expose a party to broader damages (e.g., lost profits, statutory penalties, or legal fees) beyond the liability cap.

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- If a **third party sues** the Distributor or Accuray for IP infringement (e.g., due to unauthorized use of patented technology), the liable party **cannot rely on the liability cap** in Section 11.3.  
- The exception ensures that IP-related risks are treated more severely, likely because IP infringement claims often involve **high damages** (e.g., statutory penalties, injunctions, or reputational harm).  

### Practical Implications:  
- A party accused of IP infringement could face **unlimited liability**, even if other breaches (e.g., delivery delays) are capped.  
- This incentivizes parties to **ensure proper IP licensing/warranties** in the agreement or through separate indemnity clauses.

Here’s the relevance to the query:

### 1. **Third-Party IP Infringement**  
   - The clause **carves out liability arising from Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)** from the liability cap. This means claims related to IP infringement (likely including third-party IP) are **not subject to the cap** and could expose a party to unlimited liability.  
   - However, the clause does not explicitly state whether this applies to **third-party** IP claims (e.g., indemnification for infringement claims by a patent holder). This would depend on how Section 9.3 is drafted.

### 2. **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - The clause **does not mention these exclusions**. Typically, liability caps exclude fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct to prevent parties from evading accountability for egregious acts.  
   - Since these are **not carved out**, the clause could be interpreted as **capping liability even for such conduct**, which may be unenforceable in some jurisdictions (as many laws prohibit limiting liability for intentional wrongdoing).

### 3. **General Liability Cap**  
   - The clause limits liability to:  
     - **Excluding indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) for most claims.  
     - **Capping direct damages** to the amount earned under Section 5.4 (revenue share) in the prior 12 months.  
   - This aligns with standard liability caps but lacks the typical exceptions for fraud/gross negligence.

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause partially addresses the query by:  
- Explicitly **excluding IP infringement (Section 9.3) from the cap**, which may cover third-party claims depending on Section 9.3’s wording.  
- **Failing to exclude fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**, which could create enforceability risks or unintended exposure.  

For full alignment with the query, the clause should:  
1. Clarify if third-party IP claims are covered under Section 9.3.  
2. Explicitly state that the cap **does not apply** to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Exclusion of Third-Party IP Infringement Liability**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the liability cap **does not apply** to claims arising from **third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement**.  
   - This means that if one party is sued for infringing a third party’s IP (e.g., patents, copyrights, trademarks), they **cannot rely on the liability cap** to limit their exposure—they may still be fully liable.  

2. **Limitation on Other Types of Damages**  
   - The clause caps liability for **special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or regulatory fines).  
   - However, this limitation **does not apply** to IP infringement claims, meaning such damages could still be recoverable in an IP dispute.  

3. **What’s Missing (Fraud, Gross Negligence, Willful Misconduct)?**  
   - The clause **does not explicitly exclude** fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct from the liability cap.  
   - Many contracts explicitly state that liability limitations **do not apply** in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or intentional wrongdoing. Since this clause is silent on these issues, a court might interpret it as **not excluding them**, meaning the liability cap **could still apply**—which may not align with the query’s intent.  

### **Suggested Improvement:**  
If the goal is to **fully exclude** third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from the liability cap, the clause should be revised to explicitly list all exceptions, such as:  

> *""Except with respect to (i) any claim arising from an infringement of any third-party intellectual property right, or (ii) fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages of any kind.""*

Here’s how it addresses the key elements of the query:

### 1. **Exclusion of Third-Party IP Infringement**  
   - The clause explicitly carves out liability for breaches related to the **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property** (IP) from both the limitation on damages (Section 10) and the liability cap (Section 11.3).  
   - This means that claims arising from third-party IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations) are **not subject to the liability cap** and may expose the liable party to uncapped damages.

### 2. **Exclusion of Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - The liability cap in Section 11.3 excludes claims arising from **intentional breach or willful misconduct**, which aligns with the query’s focus on fraud or deliberate wrongdoing.  
   - While ""gross negligence"" is not explicitly mentioned, ""willful misconduct"" (a higher standard) is carved out, suggesting that reckless or egregious conduct may also fall outside the cap, depending on jurisdiction and interpretation.  

### 3. **Other Exclusions from the Liability Cap**  
   - The clause also excludes liability for **non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**, ensuring statutory obligations (e.g., product safety laws) are not undermined by contractual limitations.  
   - Strict product liability under mandatory law is preserved (Section 10), further protecting against attempts to limit liability for inherently hazardous products.  

### 4. **General Liability Cap Mechanism**  
   - For all other claims (e.g., ordinary breaches of contract), liability is capped at **12 months of purchase prices paid for Products**, creating a predictable financial exposure limit.  

### **Relevance Summary**  
The clause directly responds to the query by:  
1. **Excluding IP infringement** from liability limitations.  
2. **Excluding willful misconduct/intentional breaches** (covering fraud and potentially gross negligence).  
3. **Preserving liability for statutory violations** (e.g., fraud under law).  
4. **Capping liability for ordinary breaches** while ensuring carve-outs align with common risk-allocation goals in contracts.

   - The liability cap in Section 11.3 excludes claims arising from **intentional breach or willful misconduct**, which encompasses fraud and gross negligence (as these typically involve deliberate or reckless behavior).  
   - This ensures that a party cannot shield itself from unlimited liability for actions involving bad faith or egregious fault.

ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided (Section 9.5 ""Limitation of Liability"") is directly relevant to the query regarding liability cap clauses that exclude **third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**. Here’s how it addresses the key points in the query:

### 1. **Exclusions for Fraud and Third-Party IP Infringement**  
   - The clause explicitly carves out exceptions to the liability cap for:  
     - **Fraud** (""in the event of the fraud of a party"").  
     - **Third-party IP infringement claims** (breach of obligations under ""Article 7 (Intellectual Property)"").  
     - **Indemnified third-party claims** (damages paid to a third party under Article 9 indemnification).  
   - This means the liability cap **does not apply** to these scenarios, ensuring the parties remain fully liable for fraud or IP infringement claims brought by third parties.

### 2. **Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct**  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention ""gross negligence"" or ""willful misconduct,"" it broadly excludes liability for damages arising from ""tort, negligence, breach of statutory duty, or otherwise.""  
   - However, the carve-out for **fraud** (a subset of willful misconduct) suggests that intentional or egregious wrongdoing may not be shielded by the cap. Courts in some jurisdictions may interpret such language to exclude gross negligence/willful misconduct, but the clause could be clearer on this point.  

### 3. **Scope of the Cap**  
   - The clause limits liability for:  
     - Indirect, consequential, punitive, or speculative damages.  
     - Damages that are not ""probable and reasonably foreseeable.""  
   - This protects both parties from excessive liability for ordinary breaches but preserves accountability for fraud, IP breaches, and indemnified third-party claims.  

### 4. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - The clause **aligns with the query** by:  
     1. Excluding fraud and third-party IP infringement from the liability cap.  
     2. Potentially covering gross negligence/willful misconduct under the fraud exception (though not explicitly).  
     3. Capping all other liabilities (e.g., ordinary negligence).  

### Suggested Improvements  
To fully address the query, the clause could:  
   - Explicitly mention ""gross negligence"" and ""willful misconduct"" alongside fraud.  
   - Clarify whether indemnified third-party IP claims are subject to any sub-limits.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause achieves the goal of excluding high-risk conduct (fraud/IP infringement) from liability limits but could be strengthened for gross negligence/willful misconduct. Its structure is common in contracts where parties seek to balance risk allocation while preserving accountability for intentional or egregious acts.",5

Here's how the clause is relevant:

1. **General Limitation of Liability (Section 9.1)**  
   The contract imposes a cap on liability (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the agreement, meaning neither party can be held liable beyond a specified amount ([***]) for most breaches or damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1 and 9.1.2)**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)  
   - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)  
   - Intentional misconduct or gross negligence  

3. **Relevance to Personal/Bodily Injury**  
   - The clause does **not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury** as an exception to the Liability Cap.  
   - However, bodily injury claims could potentially fall under **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** if the indemnity clause covers third-party injury claims (e.g., product liability or workplace accidents).  
   - If bodily injury results from **intentional misconduct or gross negligence (Section 9.1.2)**, the Liability Cap would not apply.  
   - If the injury arises from ordinary negligence (not gross negligence), the Liability Cap **would still apply**, unless another provision (e.g., insurance or indemnity) overrides it.  

4. **Key Takeaway**  
   The clause does not carve out a **specific exception for bodily injury**, but such claims may escape the Liability Cap if they:  
   - Are covered by indemnification (Section 7.1),  
   - Involve gross negligence or intentional harm (Section 9.1.2), or  
   - Are addressed elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., insurance requirements).

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **General Liability Cap (Section 9.1)**  
   - The parties agree to cap their liability at a specified amount (""[***]"") for claims arising under the Agreement.  

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1 and 9.1.2)**  
   The cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**: If Section 7.1 includes indemnity for third-party claims (e.g., bodily injury to a person caused by a party’s actions), such claims would **not** be subject to the Liability Cap.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**: If bodily injury results from these, the cap is inapplicable.  

3. **Definition of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**  
   - The term explicitly includes **tort claims** (e.g., negligence) and statutory liabilities, which could encompass personal/bodily injury claims. However, whether such claims are capped depends on whether they fall under the exceptions above.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- **If bodily injury claims are covered under indemnification (Section 7.1)**: They would **not** be subject to the Liability Cap.  
- **If caused by gross negligence/intentional acts**: The cap would **not** apply.  
- **Otherwise**: The Liability Cap *might* limit claims for bodily injury unless another exception (e.g., breach of confidentiality) applies.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Review Section 7.1**: Confirm if indemnity covers third-party injury claims.  
- **Check governing law**: Some jurisdictions prohibit limiting liability for personal injury, even contractually.  
- **Drafting Gap**: The clause does not **explicitly** mention ""bodily injury"" as an exception, so its treatment depends on how courts interpret the indemnity/gross negligence exceptions.  

### Suggested Revision for Clarity:
To explicitly exclude bodily injury from the cap, add:  
*""9.1.3 The Liability Cap will not apply to claims for personal injury, bodily injury, or death arising from a Party’s acts or omissions.""*

Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query regarding a **""personal or bodily injury exception to a liability cap""** in a contract. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   The clause imposes a **limitation of liability** on both parties, capping recoverable damages at an amount equal to the payments made under the agreement. This means that, for most breaches (whether due to negligence, wilful misconduct, or other causes), the maximum compensation one party can recover from the other is limited.

2. **Exception for Personal Injury or Death**:  
   The clause explicitly **excludes** claims for **personal injury or death caused by negligence** from this liability cap. This means:  
   - If a party’s negligence results in bodily harm or death, the injured party can seek damages **without being restricted by the contractual cap**.  
   - This aligns with legal principles in many jurisdictions where liability for personal injury or death cannot be contractually limited (as noted by the phrase *""for which by law no limit applies""*).  

3. **Key Relevance to the Query**:  
   - The clause confirms that **personal/bodily injury claims are treated differently** from other types of damages (e.g., financial losses).  
   - It ensures that victims of negligence retain full legal recourse for physical harm, while the liability cap applies only to non-physical damages (e.g., breach of contract, property damage).  

### Practical Implications:  
- If a party suffers a financial loss due to the other party’s breach, recovery is capped.  
- If a party suffers **physical injury or death due to negligence**, they can pursue **full compensation** (e.g., medical costs, pain and suffering) regardless of the contractual cap.  

This distinction is common in contracts to balance risk allocation while complying with mandatory legal protections for personal injury claims.",5

14.1 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, THAT ARE IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Clause 14.1)** in the contract limits both parties' liability for certain types of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from the agreement. However, the **query about a ""personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap""** raises whether this clause would exclude liability for physical harm to individuals.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Scope of the Clause**:  
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for *financial or economic* damages (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) but does **not** explicitly mention *personal injury* or *bodily harm*.  
   - In many jurisdictions, liability for personal injury cannot be contractually waived or capped, as it is often governed by tort law (negligence, etc.) or statutory protections (e.g., workplace safety laws).  

2. **Implied Exception for Personal Injury**:  
   - If the contract is silent on bodily injury, courts may interpret the clause as **not applying to physical harm**, especially if such harm results from negligence or intentional acts.  
   - Some contracts explicitly state that limitations of liability **do not apply** to claims involving death, personal injury, or gross negligence. The absence of such language here could create ambiguity.  

3. **Legal Enforceability**:  
   - In many jurisdictions, clauses attempting to limit liability for personal injury caused by negligence or misconduct are **unenforceable as against public policy**.  
   - The clause’s broad language (""notwithstanding anything to the contrary"") may not override statutory or common-law rights to sue for bodily injury.  

### Practical Implications:  
- If a party suffers bodily injury due to the other party’s actions (e.g., defective products, unsafe services), the injured party may still pursue claims **outside the contractual liability cap**, unless the contract explicitly includes personal injury within the limitations (which it does not).  
- To address the query directly: **This clause likely does not limit liability for personal/bodily injury**, unless the injury is framed as a ""consequential"" or ""incidental"" damage (which courts may reject for physical harm).  

### Recommendation:  
For clarity, the contract could include an **explicit exception**, such as:  
> *""Notwithstanding the foregoing, this limitation shall not apply to liability for death, personal injury, or gross negligence.""*

11. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.","The clause you provided (Section 10: **Limitation on Liability**) is relevant to the query about a **""personal or bodily injury exception to a liability cap""** in the following ways:

### **1. General Limitation on Liability**  
The clause broadly limits liability by excluding **special, incidental, consequential damages, and lost profits**, even if arising from negligence. This means that under normal circumstances, neither party can claim these types of damages against the other.

### **2. Exception for Breach of Confidentiality (Section 11)**  
The only stated exception is a **breach of Section 11 (Confidential Information)**. If one party breaches confidentiality, the liability cap does **not** apply, meaning the breaching party could be liable for the excluded damages (e.g., consequential damages, lost profits).

### **3. Absence of Explicit Personal/Bodily Injury Exception**  
- The clause **does not explicitly mention personal injury, bodily injury, or death** as an exception to the liability cap.  
- Many contracts (especially in high-risk industries) **carve out exceptions** for personal injury claims, as they are often treated differently under law (e.g., negligence claims may still apply despite contractual limitations).  
- Since this clause does **not** include such an exception, a court might interpret it as **not excluding liability for personal injury claims**, depending on jurisdiction and applicable law (e.g., some jurisdictions prohibit contractual waivers for gross negligence or intentional harm).  

### **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
- If a party suffers **bodily injury or personal harm** due to the other party’s actions (e.g., negligence), the injured party **may still have a claim outside this limitation clause**, unless the contract explicitly bars such claims elsewhere.  
- The clause primarily limits **financial and business-related damages**, not necessarily personal injury claims.  
- If the parties **intend to exclude liability for personal injury**, the clause should be revised to explicitly state that (e.g., *""This limitation does not apply to claims arising from personal injury or death caused by negligence or willful misconduct.""*).

9 Limitation of Liability.
9.1 The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party and its affiliates in relation to this Agreement will be [***] (""Liability Cap""), provided however that:
9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **""confidentiality exceptions to the liability cap""** because it explicitly addresses how breaches of confidentiality interact with the agreed limitation of liability in the contract. Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Confidentiality Breach Exception (Section 9.1.1)**  
   - The clause states that the **Liability Cap** (the maximum amount a party can be held liable under the agreement) **does not apply** to:  
     - *""Material confidentiality breaches under Section 5.""*  
   - This means if a party violates the confidentiality obligations (Section 5) in a **material** way (e.g., disclosing sensitive information that causes significant harm), the injured party can seek damages **beyond the capped amount**.  

2. **Scope of Liability for Confidentiality Breaches**  
   - The definition of ""liability"" in **Section 9.2** is broad, covering claims, costs, losses, attorney fees, etc., arising from contractual or statutory breaches.  
   - A confidentiality breach could trigger uncapped liability for **all resulting damages**, not just the value of the confidential information itself.  

3. **Other Exceptions Reinforce the Severity**  
   - The clause also excludes **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** and **intentional misconduct/gross negligence** from the Liability Cap.  
   - If a confidentiality breach involves **gross negligence** (e.g., reckless handling of data) or requires indemnification (e.g., third-party claims due to a leak), the uncapped exposure is further amplified.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Risk Allocation**: Parties cannot rely on the Liability Cap to shield themselves from major confidentiality breaches.  
- **Materiality Matters**: Only *material* breaches are exempt; trivial or minor breaches may still fall under the cap.  
- **Deterrent Effect**: The exception discourages careless or intentional mishandling of confidential information.  

In summary, the clause answers the query by **explicitly carving out confidentiality breaches from liability limitations**, ensuring heightened accountability for violations of Section 5.",5

9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause directly addresses the query about **confidentiality exceptions to the liability cap** by explicitly carving out exceptions to the general limitation of liability (the ""Liability Cap"") in Section 9. Here’s the breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Confidentiality Breach Exception (Section 9.1.1)**  
   - The Liability Cap **does not apply** to ""material confidentiality breaches"" under **Section 5 (Confidential Information)**.  
   - This means if a party materially breaches its confidentiality obligations, the other party can seek damages **beyond the capped amount**, even if the breach otherwise falls under the Agreement’s liability limitations.  

2. **Indemnification Exception (Section 9.1.1)**  
   - Similarly, indemnification obligations under **Section 7.1** are excluded from the Liability Cap.  
   - This ensures that claims covered by indemnity (e.g., third-party claims) are not constrained by the cap.  

3. **Intentional Misconduct/Gross Negligence (Section 9.1.2)**  
   - While not directly tied to confidentiality, this reinforces that **bad-faith actions** (e.g., willful disclosure of confidential information) are also uncapped.  

4. **Scope of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**  
   - The broad definition of liability clarifies that the exceptions cover **all forms of damages** (contract, tort, statutory, etc.) arising from confidentiality breaches.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause ensures that **material breaches of confidentiality** (and indemnification) are treated as **high-risk exposures**, allowing the aggrieved party to pursue full remedies without being limited by the Liability Cap. This protects sensitive information more robustly than general contractual breaches.

Here's how the clauses address this:

### **1. Confidentiality Agreement Exceptions (Relevance to Liability Cap)**
Both **Section 10 (Indemnities)** and **Section 11.3 (Liability Cap)** explicitly **exclude** breaches of the **Confidentiality Agreement** from the general limitations on liability (including the liability cap). This means:
- **No Liability Cap for Confidentiality Breaches**: If a party breaches the Confidentiality Agreement, the other party can seek damages **beyond** the capped amount specified in **Section 11.3**.
- **Full Liability Applies**: The breaching party could be liable for **all damages** (including special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages) arising from the breach, unless otherwise limited by law or another agreement.

### **2. Other Exceptions to the Liability Cap (Contextual Clarification)**
While the query focuses on confidentiality, **Section 11.3** also lists other exceptions where the liability cap **does not apply**:
- **Unauthorized use of Intellectual Property (IP)**  
- **Intentional breach or willful misconduct**  
- **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**  

These exceptions operate similarly to the **Confidentiality Agreement exception**—meaning liability is **uncapped** for these breaches.

### **3. Key Takeaway for the Query**
- The **Confidentiality Agreement** is treated as a **separate obligation** whose breaches **bypass** the liability cap.  
- This ensures that sensitive information is strongly protected, incentivizing compliance.  
- The drafting suggests that confidentiality breaches are considered **serious enough** to warrant full liability exposure, similar to IP misuse or intentional misconduct.

### **Conclusion**
The clause is **highly relevant** to the query because it confirms that **confidentiality breaches are excluded from the liability cap**, allowing for uncapped damages in such cases. This aligns with common contract practices where confidentiality is prioritized due to its critical business and legal implications.

Here's how the clauses address this:

### **1. Confidentiality Agreement Exceptions (Relevance to Liability Cap)**
Both **Section 10 (Indemnities)** and **Section 11.3 (Liability Cap)** explicitly **exclude** breaches of the **Confidentiality Agreement** from the general limitations on liability (including the liability cap). This means:
- **No Liability Cap for Confidentiality Breaches**: If a party breaches the Confidentiality Agreement, the other party can seek damages **beyond the capped amount** (i.e., the total purchase prices paid in the preceding 12 months).
- **Full Liability Applies**: The breaching party may be liable for **all damages** (including consequential, punitive, or special damages) arising from the confidentiality breach, unless otherwise limited by the Confidentiality Agreement itself.

### **2. Other Exceptions to the Liability Cap (Contextual Clarification)**
While the query focuses on confidentiality, the clause also carves out other exceptions where the liability cap **does not apply**:
- **Unauthorized use of Intellectual Property** (explicitly mentioned in both sections).
- **Intentional breach or willful misconduct**.
- **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**.

### **Key Takeaway**
The **Confidentiality Agreement obligations are excluded from the liability cap**, meaning breaches of confidentiality are treated as **higher-risk violations** with potentially uncapped liability. This ensures stronger protection for sensitive information shared under the agreement.

The provided **Limitations of Liability** clause (Section 10) explicitly addresses this by carving out exceptions to the general cap on liability for breaches of confidentiality and indemnification obligations. Here’s the relevance:

### Key Points:
1. **General Liability Cap (10.1)**  
   - Neither party’s liability (for most claims) can exceed the **total fees paid or payable under the agreement**.  
   - **Exception**: This cap **does not apply** to:  
     - **Breaches of confidentiality obligations** (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of confidential information).  
     - **Indemnification obligations** (e.g., claims covered by indemnity clauses, like third-party IP infringement).  

2. **Exclusion of Certain Damages (10.2)**  
   - Neither party is liable for **special, consequential, indirect, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits) **except**:  
     - For **confidentiality breaches** or **indemnification claims**, where such damages **may still be recoverable**.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **explicitly excludes confidentiality violations from the liability cap and damage exclusions**. This means:  
  - A party breaching confidentiality **could be liable for damages beyond the capped amount** (e.g., full actual damages, even if they exceed fees paid).  
  - **Consequential/punitive damages** (typically barred under 10.2) **may apply** to confidentiality breaches.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Confidentiality breaches are treated as higher-risk obligations**, warranting uncapped liability to deter misuse of sensitive information.  
- Parties remain protected for ordinary breaches (e.g., service failures) but face **full exposure** for confidentiality or indemnity claims.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Fraud/Willful Misconduct (Intentional Misconduct)**  
   - The clause carves out **""intentional misconduct""** from the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.2).  
   - Fraud typically falls under intentional misconduct (a deliberate act to deceive or harm), meaning claims arising from fraud would **not** be subject to the Liability Cap.  

2. **Negligence (Gross Negligence)**  
   - The clause excludes **""gross negligence""** from the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.2).  
   - Gross negligence is a higher degree of negligence (reckless disregard for duty), so ordinary negligence might still be capped unless the agreement or applicable law treats it differently.  

3. **Other Key Carveouts**  
   - The Liability Cap also does **not** apply to:  
     - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 9.1.1(1)).  
     - Indemnification obligations (Section 9.1.1(2)), which often cover third-party claims (e.g., IP infringement).  

4. **Scope of Liability**  
   - Section 9.2 broadly defines ""liability"" to include claims in **contract, tort (negligence), statute, etc.**, ensuring the carveouts cover all legal theories.  

### Relevance to the Query  
The clause **explicitly carves out intentional misconduct (willful misconduct/fraud) and gross negligence** from the Liability Cap, aligning with the query’s focus. However, it does **not** mention ""fraud"" or ""ordinary negligence"" explicitly:  
   - **Fraud** would likely be covered under ""intentional misconduct.""  
   - **Ordinary negligence** might still be capped unless gross negligence is proven.  

### Drafting Note  
If the query seeks to ensure **fraud and ordinary negligence** are carved out, the clause might need refinement (e.g., adding ""fraud"" explicitly or clarifying ""negligence"" without the ""gross"" qualifier).

The provided **Limitation of Liability clause (Section 9)** directly addresses this concern by:  

1. **Establishing a Liability Cap** – The general rule is that a party's liability is capped at a specified amount (denoted as [***]).  

2. **Carving Out Exceptions to the Cap** – The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2), which covers **fraud (a form of intentional misconduct) and willful misconduct**.  
   - **Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)** and **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** (Section 9.1.1).  

3. **Defining ""Liability"" Broadly** – Section 9.2 clarifies that liability includes claims arising from **tort (including negligence)**, meaning **ordinary negligence** would typically be subject to the cap. However, **gross negligence and intentional acts (like fraud or willful misconduct)** are excluded from the cap under Section 9.1.2.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **carves out fraud and willful misconduct** (via ""intentional misconduct"") and **gross negligence** from the liability cap.  
- **Ordinary negligence** remains subject to the cap (since only ""gross negligence"" is excluded).  
- The carveout ensures that a party cannot shield itself from unlimited liability for **egregious conduct** (fraud, intentional harm, or reckless disregard).

Here’s how it works:

### Key Points:
1. **Carveout for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - Both **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** include exceptions where the liability cap or exclusion of consequential damages **does not apply**.  
   - Specifically, **subsection (E)** in 11.6 and **subsection (V)** in 11.7 state that a party’s **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are **excluded from the limitations on liability**.  
   - This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they can be held fully liable for **all damages** (including consequential, indirect, or uncapped amounts) that result from such misconduct.

2. **Impact on Liability Cap**  
   - Normally, **Section 11.7** imposes a **monetary cap** on a party’s total liability under the agreement.  
   - However, **subsection (A)(V)** explicitly states that this cap **does not apply** to claims arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.  
   - Thus, if a party commits fraud or gross negligence, their liability is **uncapped**, and they can be sued for the full extent of damages.

3. **No Exclusion of Consequential Damages**  
   - **Section 11.6** generally bars recovery of **consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, indirect losses).  
   - However, **subsection (E)** ensures that if fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct is involved, the injured party **can still claim consequential damages** despite the general prohibition.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause ensures that **bad-faith or egregious conduct (fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct) is not shielded** by contractual liability limits.  
- It acts as a **deterrent** against intentional or reckless wrongdoing by preventing parties from hiding behind liability caps.  
- It aligns with **common legal principles** that prohibit wrongdoers from benefiting from contractual protections meant for ordinary breaches.

### Conclusion:

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Provisions Addressing the Query:
1. **Carveouts to Liability Limitations**  
   - **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)**: Excludes liability for consequential damages **except** in specific cases, including:  
     - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection E).  
     - Indemnification obligations (subsection F).  
   - **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)**: Caps a party’s aggregate liability **unless** the claim involves:  
     - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection (a)(V)).  
     - Indemnification obligations (subsection (a)(VI)).  

   These carveouts ensure that a party cannot shield itself from liability for intentional or egregious wrongdoing (fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct) or indemnification claims, even if the contract otherwise limits damages or total liability.

2. **Indemnification Clauses (Articles 12.1 and 12.2)**  
   - Both parties (BLI and Ginkgo) must indemnify the other for losses arising from their own **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (Sections 12.1(b) and 12.2(b)).  
   - This reinforces that liability for such conduct is **unlimited** and not subject to the caps in Sections 11.6 and 11.7.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **explicitly carves out fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** from both:  
  - The exclusion of consequential damages (Section 11.6).  
  - The general liability cap (Section 11.7).  
- This means a party engaging in such conduct **can be held fully liable** (including for consequential damages and beyond the capped amount).  
- The indemnification provisions further ensure that the harmed party can recover losses caused by the other party’s misconduct.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Allocation**: Parties cannot avoid liability for intentional or reckless acts.  
- **Deterrence**: Discourages bad-faith behavior by preserving legal recourse.  
- **Negotiation Point**: The carveout is often non-negotiable in contracts, as courts may refuse to enforce caps on liability for misconduct.  

In summary, the clause directly answers the query by ensuring that **fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct are exceptions to liability limitations**, allowing full recovery for such claims.",5

Ginkgo will indemnify, defend and hold BLI and its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, employees, Permitted Subcontractors and agents (each, an ""BLI Indemnitee"") harmless from and against any and all Claims and Losses, to the extent caused by or arising as a result of (a) the breach by Ginkgo of this Agreement or material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Ginkgo under this Agreement, (b) the negligence, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement, (c) [***] and (d) any Claims by Ginkgo's employees, Permitted Subcontractors or agents for worker's compensation or other liability coverage, insurance, benefits, and other employee-related claims, and (e) the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, importation, distribution, sale or other commercialization of Ginkgo Inventions by Ginkgo or its Affiliates, agents, licensees, sublicensees or customers, in each case of clauses (a)-(e) of this Section 12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo) except to the extent BLI has an obligation to indemnify a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with such Claims and Losses pursuant to Section 12.1 (Indemnification by BLI).","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct carveouts to liability caps** in the following ways:

### **1. Carveouts for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
Both **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** explicitly exclude **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** from the general limitations on liability. This means:  
- **No protection for bad actors**: A party engaging in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct **cannot** rely on the liability cap or the exclusion of consequential damages.  
- **Full liability exposure**: The offending party remains fully liable for **all** damages (including consequential, indirect, and exemplary damages) arising from such misconduct.  

### **2. Indemnification Obligations Reinforce the Carveout**  
- **Sections 12.1 & 12.2 (Indemnification)** further confirm that **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** trigger indemnification obligations.  
- If a party’s misconduct (e.g., fraud) causes third-party claims, they must **indemnify** the other party for all resulting losses, **without** the benefit of the liability cap.  

### **3. Key Takeaways**  
- **Liability caps do not apply** to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.  
- **Consequential damages are recoverable** in these cases (unlike under normal breach scenarios).  
- **Indemnification obligations remain intact**, meaning the wrongdoer must cover all related claims.  

### **Why This Matters**  
This structure ensures that parties cannot escape liability for **intentional or egregious wrongdoing**, while still capping exposure for ordinary breaches or negligence. It aligns with common legal principles that **bad faith or reckless behavior should not be shielded** by contractual limitations.

ARTICLE 10","This clause (Section 9.5 ""Limitation of Liability"") is directly relevant to the query about a party's liability for **fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort** subject to a cap. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### 1. **Fraud**  
   - The clause explicitly **excludes fraud from the limitation of liability**.  
   - If a party commits fraud, their liability is **uncapped** (i.e., they can be held fully liable for all resulting damages).  
   - This aligns with legal principles that generally do not allow parties to contractually limit liability for intentional wrongdoing.

### 2. **Negligence, Tort, or Personal Injury**  
   - The clause broadly limits liability for claims arising in **tort, negligence, or breach of statutory duty** (which could include personal injury claims).  
   - It excludes liability for:  
     - **Indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, or speculative damages** (unless they are ""probable and reasonably foreseeable"").  
     - **Damages that are not foreseeable** at the time of contract formation.  
   - However, this limitation **does not apply** if:  
     - The damages result from a breach of **confidentiality (Article 10)** or **IP obligations (Article 7)**.  
     - The damages are **owed to a third party** under an indemnification claim (meaning the indemnifying party must cover such costs).  

### 3. **Cap on Liability?**  
   - While this clause does not specify a **monetary cap**, it **functionally limits liability** by excluding certain categories of damages (e.g., consequential, punitive).  
   - If the contract has a separate **monetary cap clause** (e.g., ""total liability shall not exceed $X""), this would further restrict liability for negligence/tort claims.  
   - However, **fraud remains uncapped**, and indemnified third-party claims are also excluded from this limitation.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- **Fraud:** No cap on liability.  
- **Negligence/Tort/Personal Injury:** Liability is limited (no consequential/punitive damages unless foreseeable or indemnified).  
- **Indemnified Third-Party Claims:** Not subject to this limitation.

Here's how it addresses the key elements of the query:

### 1. **Scope of Liability Limitations**  
   - The clause broadly limits liability for damages arising from **tort (including negligence)**, which covers claims related to negligence or personal injury (a subset of tort).  
   - However, it does **not explicitly mention fraud** or intentional misconduct. In many jurisdictions, liability for fraud or willful misconduct cannot be contractually limited, so its exclusion here may leave such claims uncapped unless implied by law.  

### 2. **Cap on Liability**  
   - The clause imposes a **financial cap** on liability for all claims (including tort and negligence), limiting recovery to **""the amounts to be paid by Client to [Exciting] hereunder.""**  
   - This means the maximum liability for damages (even for negligence or tort) cannot exceed the contractual payments agreed between the parties.  

### 3. **Exclusions for Certain Damages**  
   - The clause **excludes liability for special, incidental, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) arising from tort or negligence, unless Sections 13(a) and 13(b) apply (which likely carve out exceptions, such as for gross negligence or indemnity obligations).  

### 4. **Gaps and Ambiguities**  
   - **Fraud**: The clause does not explicitly address fraud, which may remain uncapped if courts deem such limitations unenforceable as a matter of public policy.  
   - **Personal Injury**: While ""tort"" includes personal injury claims, the enforceability of caps on such liability may depend on jurisdiction-specific laws (e.g., some states prohibit limits for bodily injury).  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **limits liability for negligence and tort (including personal injury)** to a contractual cap but may not protect against fraud claims. Its enforceability hinges on applicable law and whether Sections 13(a) and 13(b) carve out broader liabilities.

Here’s how it addresses the key points in the query:

### 1. **General Liability Cap**  
   - The clause imposes a maximum liability cap (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the Agreement, including those in **tort (e.g., negligence, personal injury)** or other legal theories (contract, equity, statute, etc.).  
   - This means that, absent exceptions, claims for negligence or torts (e.g., personal injury) would be subject to the capped amount.

### 2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2):  
     - This covers **fraud** (a deliberate act) and **gross negligence** (reckless disregard for duty), meaning liability for these acts is **uncapped**.  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1):  
     - If the Agreement requires indemnification for third-party claims (e.g., personal injury), those obligations may bypass the cap.  
   - **Material confidentiality breaches** (Section 5):  
     - While not directly related to the query, this reinforces that certain breaches are treated more severely.  

### 3. **Scope of ""Liability""**  
   - Section 9.2 explicitly defines ""liability"" to include claims arising from **tort (including negligence)**, **statutory violations**, and **equitable claims**, ensuring the cap applies broadly unless an exception (e.g., gross negligence) is triggered.  
   - **Personal injury claims** (a subset of tort) would fall under this definition and thus be subject to the cap, unless they result from intentional/grossly negligent conduct.

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- **Fraud**: Uncapped (falls under ""intentional misconduct"").  
- **Negligence**: Capped, unless it rises to **gross negligence**.  
- **Personal Injury/Torts**: Capped, unless caused by intentional/grossly negligent acts or covered by indemnification.  
- The clause balances risk allocation by capping ordinary negligence/torts while exposing bad actors (fraud/gross negligence) to full liability.

"a party's liability for fraud, negligence, personal injury or tort subject to a cap",6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The clause you provided (Section 13.4 ""Limitation of Liability"") is relevant to the query about a party's liability for fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort subject to a cap in the following ways:

### 1. **Scope of Limitation**  
The clause broadly limits liability for various types of damages, including those arising from torts (e.g., negligence, personal injury) and statutory violations. It explicitly states that neither party will be liable for:  
   - **Consequential, indirect, incidental, or punitive damages** (which often arise from tort claims like negligence or fraud).  
   - **Lost profits/revenue** (common in fraud or breach of fiduciary duty claims).  

However, it does not explicitly mention ""fraud"" or ""personal injury,"" which could create ambiguity.

### 2. **Exclusions from the Cap**  
The clause carves out two key exceptions where liability may **not** be capped:  
   - **Breach of Confidentiality (Section 11)**: Liability for confidentiality breaches is excluded from this limitation.  
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: If the contract includes separate indemnity clauses (e.g., for third-party claims), those obligations are unaffected.  

This means claims like fraud or personal injury **could still be fully actionable** if they fall under indemnification or confidentiality breaches.

### 3. **Tort Liability (Negligence/Personal Injury)**  
The clause attempts to limit tort-based claims (e.g., negligence) by excluding liability for ""incidental"" or ""statutory"" damages. However:  
   - **Enforceability may vary**: Many jurisdictions do not allow parties to contractually limit liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or personal injury (as noted by the exception for ""Applicable Law"").  
   - **Third-Party Claims**: If a third party sues for personal injury, the clause does not cap damages awarded to that third party (per the ""Third Party Claim"" exception).  

### 4. **Fraud Liability**  
Fraud is not explicitly mentioned, but:  
   - **Public Policy**: Courts often refuse to enforce liability caps for fraud or intentional misconduct, as it violates public policy.  
   - **Interpretation Risk**: If fraud arises from a breach of confidentiality (Section 11), the cap may not apply. Otherwise, a court might disregard the cap entirely for fraudulent acts.  

### 5. **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
This clause **attempts** to cap liability for torts (negligence, some statutory claims) and indirect damages but is unlikely to fully shield a party from:  
   - Fraud or willful misconduct.  
   - Personal injury claims (especially by third parties).  
   - Any liability prohibited by ""Applicable Law.""  

### Suggested Refinements  
To address the query more clearly, the clause could:  
   - Explicitly state whether fraud/gross negligence are capped.  
   - Clarify if personal injury claims are subject to the cap (though this may be unenforceable in many jurisdictions).

Here’s how it addresses the key points:

### 1. **General Liability Cap**  
   - The clause imposes a maximum liability cap (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the Agreement, including those in **tort (e.g., negligence, personal injury)** and other statutory or equitable claims.  
   - This means that, by default, liability for **ordinary negligence** or **non-intentional torts** (e.g., accidental personal injury) would be limited to the agreed cap.

### 2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Intentional misconduct and gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2):  
     - This covers **fraud** (a deliberate act) and **gross negligence** (reckless disregard for duty), meaning liability for these acts is **uncapped**.  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1):  
     - If the Agreement includes indemnity for third-party claims (e.g., personal injury), those obligations may bypass the cap.  
   - **Material confidentiality breaches** (Section 5):  
     - While not directly related to torts, this ensures that severe breaches of confidentiality (e.g., malicious leaks) are also uncapped.  

### 3. **Scope of ""Liability""**  
   - Section 9.2 explicitly defines ""liability"" to include claims in **tort (negligence)**, **statutory violations**, and **equitable claims**, confirming that the cap applies to **personal injury** or other torts unless an exception (e.g., gross negligence) applies.  

### **Summary of Relevance to Query**  
- **Fraud/Intentional Misconduct**: Uncapped (Section 9.1.2).  
- **Gross Negligence**: Uncapped (Section 9.1.2).  
- **Ordinary Negligence/Personal Injury/Torts**: Capped *unless* they fall under indemnification (Section 7.1) or involve gross negligence.

1. **Indemnification Carveout from Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1)**  
   - The **Liability Cap** (set at [***]) does **not** apply to indemnification obligations under **Section 7.1**.  
   - If **Section 7.1** includes indemnification for **personal or bodily injury claims** (e.g., third-party claims for harm caused by a party’s actions), such claims would **not** be subject to the Liability Cap.  
   - This means the indemnifying party could be liable for **uncapped damages** related to bodily injury, even if other liabilities are capped.

2. **Exceptions for Intentional Misconduct/Gross Negligence (Section 9.1.2)**  
   - The Liability Cap also **does not apply** to **intentional misconduct** or **gross negligence**.  
   - If personal/bodily injury results from such conduct, the at-fault party’s liability would be **uncapped**.

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**  
   - The definition explicitly includes **tort-based claims** (e.g., negligence) and statutory liabilities, which could cover bodily injury claims.  
   - However, the **Liability Cap would still apply** to such claims **unless** they fall under the exceptions (indemnification, intentional/gross negligence, or confidentiality breaches).

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **allows for uncapped liability** for personal/bodily injury **if**:  
- The injury is covered under **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**, or  
- It results from **intentional/grossly negligent conduct**.  

If neither applies, bodily injury claims could still be **capped** at [***] unless another exception (e.g., confidentiality breach) is triggered.  

**Drafting Note:** To ensure bodily injury is expressly excluded from the cap, the indemnification section (7.1) should **explicitly list it** as a covered obligation. Otherwise, courts may limit the exception to the specific language of the contract.",5

12.4 Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided is relevant to the query about a **""personal or bodily injury exception to the cap on liability via indemnification carveout""** in the following ways:

### 1. **General Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - The agreement imposes a **maximum aggregate liability cap** (e.g., $[* * *]) for all claims, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or under indemnification.  
   - This means that, in most cases, a party’s liability cannot exceed this capped amount, even for claims like breach of contract or negligence.  

### 2. **Indemnification Carveout (Section 12.3 & 12.4)**  
   - While Section 12.4 broadly limits liability, it includes an exception for **indemnifiable losses** (referenced in Section 12.3).  
   - Section 12.3 clarifies that the **exclusion of consequential/special damages does not apply to indemnification obligations**.  
   - If **personal or bodily injury** is defined as an **""Indemnifiable Loss""** elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., under indemnification provisions for third-party claims), then such claims **would not be subject to the liability cap** in Section 12.4.  

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - If the agreement includes indemnification for **third-party bodily injury claims** (e.g., under a separate indemnity clause), those claims would **bypass the liability cap** because of the carveout in Section 12.4 (""whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions"").  
   - However, if personal/bodily injury claims are **not covered under indemnification**, they would likely be **subject to the cap** (unless another exception applies).  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **does not explicitly mention bodily injury**, but if such injuries fall under **indemnifiable losses**, they would **not be capped**. Otherwise, the general liability limit in Section 12.4 would apply. To confirm, you would need to review:  
   - The definition of **""Indemnifiable Loss""** in the agreement.  
   - Any **specific indemnification provisions** related to bodily injury.

12.4 Limitation on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding a **""personal or bodily injury exception to the cap on liability via an indemnification carveout""** in the following ways:

### 1. **General Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - The agreement imposes a **maximum aggregate liability cap** (e.g., $[* * *]) on each party for all claims, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or under indemnification.  
   - This means that, in most cases, a party’s total liability cannot exceed the specified cap, even for claims that would otherwise allow higher damages (e.g., negligence claims).  

### 2. **Indemnification Carveout (Section 12.3 & 12.4)**  
   - Section 12.3 excludes **indemnifiable losses** from the general exclusion of **indirect/consequential/special damages**.  
   - Section 12.4 clarifies that the liability cap applies **""whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions""**, suggesting that indemnification claims are *subject to the cap* unless an exception applies.  

### 3. **Relevance to Personal/Bodily Injury Exception**  
   - The clause does **not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury** as an exception to the liability cap.  
   - However, if **indemnifiable losses** (Section 12.3) include claims for bodily injury (e.g., under a third-party indemnity claim), then such claims might **bypass the exclusion of consequential damages** but still be **subject to the overall liability cap** in Section 12.4.  
   - If the parties intended to **fully exclude bodily injury from the cap**, the clause would need an explicit carveout (e.g., *""This limitation shall not apply to liability arising from personal injury or bodily harm""*).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The current language suggests that:  
- Indemnification claims (potentially including third-party bodily injury claims) are **not barred as ""consequential damages""** (Section 12.3).  
- However, they **likely remain subject to the aggregate cap** (Section 12.4) unless another provision (e.g., a separate indemnity clause) overrides this.  
- To ensure bodily injury claims are **fully exempt from the cap**, the agreement would need a clearer exception.

9 Limitation of Liability.
9.1 The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party and its affiliates in relation to this Agreement will be [***] (""Liability Cap""), provided however that:
9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause is relevant to the query regarding a **""personal or bodily injury exception to the cap on liability via indemnification carveout""** in the following ways:

1. **Indemnification Carveout from Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1)**  
   - The **Liability Cap** (Section 9.1) does **not** apply to indemnification obligations under **Section 7.1**.  
   - If **Section 7.1** includes indemnification for **personal or bodily injury claims** (e.g., third-party claims for harm caused by a party’s negligence), then such claims would **not** be subject to the Liability Cap.  
   - This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for bodily injury liabilities (e.g., under a third-party claim), the indemnifying party’s liability would be **uncapped**.

2. **Gross Negligence/Intentional Misconduct Exception (Section 9.1.2)**  
   - The Liability Cap also **does not apply** to **intentional misconduct or gross negligence**.  
   - If personal/bodily injury arises from such conduct, the at-fault party’s liability would be **fully exposed**, regardless of the cap.

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**  
   - The definition of ""liability"" explicitly includes **tort claims** (e.g., negligence) and statutory liabilities, which would cover personal injury claims.  
   - However, the **Liability Cap** would still apply to ordinary negligence claims **unless** they fall under the indemnification carveout (Section 9.1.1) or involve gross negligence/intentional harm (Section 9.1.2).

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **allows for uncapped liability** for personal/bodily injury **if**:  
- The injury is covered under **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**, or  
- It results from **gross negligence or intentional misconduct**.  

If the indemnification section (**7.1**) explicitly includes bodily injury claims (e.g., ""Party A shall indemnify Party B for third-party personal injury claims""), then such claims would **bypass the Liability Cap** entirely. Otherwise, only injuries caused by **gross negligence/intentional acts** would be uncapped.  

For full clarity, you would need to review **Section 7.1** to confirm whether it covers bodily injury indemnification. If it does, this clause ensures those liabilities are **not limited** by the cap.",5

### 1. **Indemnification Scope and Carveouts**  
   - The clause broadly requires the franchisee (you) to indemnify the franchisor (us) and related parties (""Indemnitees"") for **all losses and expenses** arising from the franchisee's operations, including claims related to **personal or bodily injury** (e.g., from vehicle accidents or other incidents).  
   - However, there is a **carveout**: The indemnity **does not apply to liability arising from the Indemnitees' gross negligence** (unless joint liability is involved, in which case the franchisee must still indemnify for their share of comparative/contributory negligence).  

   → This creates a **partial exception** to the franchisee’s indemnification obligation for injuries caused by the franchisor’s gross negligence.  

### 2. **Cap on Liability Implications**  
   - If the franchise agreement includes a separate **cap on liability** (e.g., limiting the franchisor’s total financial exposure), this indemnification clause **effectively overrides that cap** for claims covered by the indemnity.  
   - The franchisee must cover **all** losses (including bodily injury claims), **unless** the injury resulted from the franchisor’s gross negligence. In that case, the carveout prevents indemnification, potentially exposing the franchisor to uncapped liability.  

### 3. **Key Relevance to the Query**  
   - The clause **does not explicitly mention bodily injury**, but it covers all claims arising from franchise operations (which would include such injuries).  
   - The **gross negligence carveout** acts as an **exception** to the franchisee’s indemnification duty, meaning the franchisor could face **uncapped liability** for injuries caused by its own gross negligence.  
   - If the agreement has a general liability cap elsewhere, this indemnification clause **preserves the franchisor’s right to recover beyond that cap** from the franchisee—except for gross negligence claims.  

### Practical Takeaway:  
The clause ensures the franchisee bears liability for most injury claims (even if the franchisor is vicariously liable), but the franchisor **cannot shift liability for its own gross negligence** to the franchisee. This creates a **targeted exception** to the indemnification obligation, which could interact with any broader liability cap in the agreement.

Here’s how:

1. **Carveout for IP Infringement Liability (Section 9.3)**  
   The clause explicitly **excludes liability arising from Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)** from both:  
   - The **exclusion of indirect/consequential damages** (first paragraph)  
   - The **monetary cap on liability** (second paragraph)  

   This means that claims related to third-party IP infringement (e.g., indemnification for infringement claims under Section 9.3) are **not subject to the liability limitations** that otherwise apply to other types of claims under the agreement.

2. **Implications for the Query**  
   - **No Cap on IP Infringement Liability**: While the agreement generally limits liability to the amount earned in the preceding 12 months (Section 5.4), this cap **does not apply** to IP infringement claims.  
   - **Full Exposure for IP Claims**: The indemnifying party could be liable for **uncapped damages** (including direct, indirect, or consequential damages) arising from third-party IP infringement.  
   - **Indemnification Carveout**: This exception ensures that IP infringement risks are treated as a **high-priority liability**, overriding the standard contractual protections.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause confirms that **third-party IP infringement claims are carved out from the liability cap**, meaning the indemnifying party assumes **unlimited financial responsibility** for such claims, unlike other types of breaches. This aligns with common contractual risk allocation where IP infringement is treated as a **high-stakes exposure** warranting broader liability.

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### **Key Elements of the Clause:**
1. **General Limitation of Liability (Section 12.1)**  
   - Broadly excludes liability for **incidental, consequential, indirect, special, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, etc.).  

2. **Cap on Liability (Section 12.2)**  
   - **Total liability is capped** at the amounts paid/payable by the Reseller to Todos in the **12 months preceding the claim**.  
   - However, this cap **does not apply** to three exceptions:  
     - **Breach of confidentiality**  
     - **Indemnification obligations**  
     - **Infringement of intellectual property rights (IPR)**  

### **Relevance to the Query:**
- The clause explicitly **carves out IP infringement** (including third-party claims) from the **liability cap**, meaning:  
  - If one party is sued by a third party for IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations), the **at-fault party’s liability is not limited** to the capped amount.  
  - Instead, the indemnifying party must cover **full damages** (including legal costs, settlements, or judgments) arising from such claims.  

- **Indemnification carveout** ensures that:  
  - The indemnitor (party responsible for IP infringement) remains **fully liable** for third-party IP claims, even if other liabilities are capped.  
  - This aligns with standard risk allocation in contracts, where IP infringement is treated as a **high-stakes exposure** warranting uncapped liability.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **excludes third-party IP infringement from the liability cap**, ensuring that indemnification obligations for such claims remain **uncapped and fully enforceable**. This protects the non-infringing party from bearing excessive risk in IP disputes.",5

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
The **Limitation of Liability clause (Section 9.3)** generally restricts both parties from being liable for certain types of damages (e.g., indirect, consequential, exemplary). However, it includes **key exceptions** where liability is **not capped**, including:  

1. **Breach of IP-related warranties (Section 8.1.5(v))** – If a party breaches its representations/warranties regarding third-party IP (e.g., non-infringement), the liability cap does not apply.  
2. **Indemnification obligations for third-party IP claims (Sections 9.4(i)(d) & 9.5(i)(d))** – Both parties (Impresse and VerticalNet) must indemnify each other for third-party IP infringement claims, and this indemnification is **excluded from the liability cap**.  

### **Key Takeaways:**  
- The clause ensures that **third-party IP infringement claims** (via indemnification) are **not subject to the general liability limitations**.  
- This means if one party is sued for IP infringement due to the other party’s actions (e.g., unauthorized use of third-party IP), the indemnifying party remains **fully liable** for damages, even if the contract otherwise limits liability.  
- The exception protects the indemnified party from bearing the financial risk of IP disputes, reinforcing the importance of IP warranties and indemnities in the agreement.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause directly addresses the query by confirming that **third-party IP infringement claims are carved out from the liability cap** via indemnification obligations, ensuring full financial responsibility for such claims.",5

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **General Limitation of Liability (LOL)**:  
   - The clause (Section 13.4) broadly limits liability for certain damages (e.g., consequential, indirect, punitive) **unless** an exception applies.  

2. **Indemnification Carveout for Third-Party Claims**:  
   - The clause states that the LOL **does not limit a party’s indemnification obligations** (""without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder"").  
   - This means that if a party is required to **indemnify** the other for third-party claims (e.g., IP infringement claims under an indemnity clause elsewhere in the agreement), the liability cap **does not apply** to such claims.  

3. **Third-Party IP Infringement Implications**:  
   - If a third party sues for IP infringement (a ""Third Party Claim""), and the contract includes an **indemnity obligation** for such claims, the indemnifying party’s liability would **not be capped** by this LOL clause.  
   - The last sentence reinforces this by stating that the LOL does not apply to damages **awarded to a third party** in such claims.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
- The clause **preserves full liability for third-party IP infringement claims** if they fall under the contract’s indemnification obligations.  
- The LOL cap applies to **direct claims between the parties** (e.g., breach of contract) but **not to third-party claims covered by indemnity**.  

Thus, the clause effectively **carves out third-party IP infringement liabilities from the general liability cap**, ensuring that indemnification obligations remain fully enforceable.

The provided clauses (Sections 10 and 11.3) address this directly by **excluding liability for unauthorized use of intellectual property (IP) from the general cap on damages and liability limitations**. Here’s the breakdown:

### **1. Indemnification Carveout for IP Infringement (Section 10 & 11.3)**
- **General Liability Limitation**:  
  - The agreement broadly limits liability for **special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or tort damages** (Section 10).  
  - It also imposes a **monetary cap** on liability (Section 11.3), typically tied to the purchase price paid in the preceding 12 months.  

- **Exceptions to the Cap (Carveouts)**:  
  The liability cap **does not apply** to:  
  - **Unauthorized use of Intellectual Property (IP)** (Sections 10 & 11.3(i))  
  - Intentional breaches/willful misconduct (11.3(ii))  
  - Non-compliance with mandatory laws (11.3(iii))  

  This means that if a party is sued by a **third party for IP infringement** (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations), the **liability cap does not protect the infringing party**—they could be liable for **uncapped damages** (including indemnification costs).  

### **2. Relevance to the Query**
- The clause explicitly **carves out third-party IP infringement claims** from the liability cap, ensuring that:  
  - The indemnifying party remains **fully liable** for IP-related breaches (e.g., if Distributor uses Accuray’s products in a way that infringes a third party’s IP).  
  - The **standard limitations on consequential/punitive damages** (Section 10) and the **monetary cap** (Section 11.3) **do not apply** in such cases.  

### **3. Practical Implications**
- If a third party sues for IP infringement, the breaching party **cannot rely on the liability cap** (e.g., the 12-month purchase price limit).  
- The indemnification obligation for IP infringement remains **uncapped**, exposing the liable party to **full damages** (including legal fees, settlements, or court-awarded amounts).  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause ensures that **IP infringement risks are treated as a high-priority exception**, preventing a party from shielding itself with contractual liability limits when third-party IP rights are violated. This aligns with common legal practices where IP indemnities are often excluded from liability caps due to their significant financial and reputational risks.

Here’s how the provided clauses address this issue:

### **1. Carveout for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
The contract explicitly **excludes** fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct from:  
- **Limitations on consequential damages (Section 11.6)** – These types of misconduct are carved out from the general exclusion of liability for indirect or consequential damages.  
- **Aggregate liability cap (Section 11.7)** – The liability cap does **not** apply to claims arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.  

This means that if a party engages in such misconduct, they can be held **fully liable** (without the usual contractual limitations on damages or liability caps).  

### **2. Indemnification Obligations Reinforce the Exception**  
- **Sections 12.1(b) & 12.2(b)** explicitly require each party to indemnify the other for losses caused by their own **negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct**.  
- This means that if a party’s fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct causes a third-party claim, the indemnifying party must cover **all associated losses**, regardless of the general liability cap.  

### **3. Interaction Between Liability Limits and Indemnification**  
- The indemnification obligations (Article 12) are **explicitly excluded** from the liability cap (Section 11.7(VI)).  
- Thus, if fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct triggers indemnification, the liable party **cannot rely on the liability cap** to limit exposure.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clauses ensure that:  
1. **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct are not shielded** by the standard liability limitations.  
2. **Indemnification obligations fully apply** to such misconduct, meaning the liable party must cover all resulting losses.  
3. The **aggregate liability cap does not protect** a party found guilty of such misconduct.  

This structure ensures that bad-faith or egregious conduct is not rewarded with contractual liability protections.",5

The provided clauses (Sections 11.6, 11.7, 12.1, and 12.2) explicitly address this issue in the following ways:

### **1. Carveout from Liability Limitations (Sections 11.6 and 11.7)**
- **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** generally excludes liability for indirect/consequential damages **unless** the damages arise from:  
  - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection E)  
  - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (subsection F)  
  - This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they **can** be held liable for consequential damages that would otherwise be excluded.  

- **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** imposes an overall cap on liability **except** for:  
  - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection (a)(V))  
  - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (subsection (a)(VI))  
  - Thus, **fraudulent, grossly negligent, or willfully misconducting parties cannot rely on the liability cap**—their exposure is uncapped.  

### **2. Indemnification Obligations (Sections 12.1 and 12.2)**
- **Section 12.1 (BLI’s Indemnification)** requires BLI to indemnify Ginkgo for:  
  - Negligence, **gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** by BLI Indemnitees (subsection (b))  
  - This means that if BLI (or its representatives) act fraudulently, grossly negligently, or with willful misconduct, they **must fully indemnify** the other party, regardless of liability caps.  

- **Section 12.2 (Ginkgo’s Indemnification)** similarly requires Ginkgo to indemnify BLI for:  
  - Negligence, **gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** by Ginkgo Indemnitees (subsection (b))  
  - Again, this ensures that **bad-faith or egregious misconduct is not shielded** by liability limitations.  

### **Relevance to the Query**
The clauses **explicitly carve out fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** from:  
1. **Limitations on consequential damages** (Section 11.6)  
2. **Overall liability caps** (Section 11.7)  
3. **Indemnification obligations** (Sections 12.1 & 12.2)  

This means:  
- A party engaging in such misconduct **cannot rely on contractual liability protections** (caps or exclusions).  
- The injured party can **seek full indemnification** for losses caused by such misconduct.  
- The carveout ensures that **intentional or egregious wrongdoing is not rewarded with limited liability**.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clauses align with the query by ensuring that **fraudulent, grossly negligent, or willfully misconducting parties remain fully liable**, both in terms of indemnification and uncapped damages, despite general liability limitations in the contract. This is a standard but critical risk allocation mechanism in contracts.",5

The provided clauses (Sections 11.6 and 11.7) explicitly address this issue in the following ways:

### **1. Carveout for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
Both clauses exclude **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** from limitations on liability:  
- **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages):**  
  - Normally, neither party is liable for **consequential, indirect, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits).  
  - However, this exclusion **does not apply** if damages arise from **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsection (E)).  
  - Thus, a party engaging in such misconduct **can still be held liable for consequential damages** that would otherwise be excluded.  

- **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit):**  
  - The contract imposes a **monetary cap** on liability for claims.  
  - However, this cap **does not apply** to claims involving **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsection (a)(V)).  
  - This means a party committing such misconduct **can be sued for full damages**, bypassing the liability cap.  

### **2. Connection to Indemnification (Article 12)**  
Both clauses also **carve out indemnification obligations** (Article 12) from liability limitations, meaning:  
- A party’s indemnification duties (e.g., covering third-party claims) are **not subject to the liability cap** or exclusion of consequential damages.  
- If fraud/gross negligence **triggers indemnification**, the liable party cannot hide behind the contract’s liability limits.  

### **3. Relevance to the Query**  
The clauses confirm that:  
- **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are **explicit exceptions** to both:  
  - The **exclusion of consequential damages** (11.6).  
  - The **monetary cap on liability** (11.7).  
- These exceptions ensure that a party engaging in **intentional or egregious misconduct** cannot shield itself from full liability.  
- The **indemnification carveout** further reinforces this by ensuring that indemnity claims (e.g., third-party lawsuits) are **not capped** if tied to such misconduct.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clauses ensure that **bad actors** (those committing fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct) **cannot benefit from liability protections** in the contract. This aligns with legal principles that prevent parties from contractually limiting liability for intentional or reckless wrongdoing.

9 Limitation of Liability.
9.1 The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party and its affiliates in relation to this Agreement will be [***] (""""Liability Cap""""), provided however that:
9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause is directly relevant to the query regarding exceptions to the cap on liability for **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** via an **indemnification carveout**. Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Fraud/Willful Misconduct (Intentional Misconduct)**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap **does not apply** to **""intentional misconduct""** (Section 9.1.2).  
   - ""Intentional misconduct"" is a legal term that encompasses **fraud** and **willful misconduct**, meaning a party cannot limit liability for deliberate wrongful acts.  

2. **Gross Negligence**  
   - The clause also carves out **""gross negligence""** (Section 9.1.2) from the Liability Cap.  
   - This ensures that a party cannot shield itself from unlimited liability for reckless or egregious failures to meet contractual or legal duties.  

3. **Indemnification Carveout**  
   - While the query mentions indemnification carveouts, Section 9.1.1 explicitly excludes **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** from the Liability Cap.  
   - This means claims covered by indemnification (e.g., third-party claims) are not subject to the cap, regardless of fault. However, the clause does not explicitly tie indemnification to fraud/gross negligence—it’s a separate exception.  

4. **Confidentiality Breach**  
   - Though not part of the query, Section 9.1.1 also carves out **material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)**, which could overlap with fraud or misconduct in some cases (e.g., intentional theft of trade secrets).  

### Drafting Implications:
- The clause **prioritizes accountability** for egregious acts (fraud, gross negligence, intentional misconduct) by ensuring they are **not capped**.  
- It aligns with common legal principles that prohibit parties from contractually limiting liability for **bad-faith conduct**.  
- The broad definition of ""liability"" (Section 9.2) ensures all forms of damages (contract, tort, statutory) are covered by these exceptions.  

### Potential Gaps:
- **Fraud** is not explicitly listed (only ""intentional misconduct""), though it would likely fall under this term.  
- The indemnification carveout (Section 9.1.1) is **not explicitly linked** to fault-based conduct (e.g., gross negligence in indemnified claims). This could create ambiguity if indemnification itself is subject to a separate liability cap elsewhere in the agreement.  

### Conclusion:
The clause **fully addresses the query** by excluding fraud (via ""intentional misconduct""), gross negligence, and willful misconduct from the Liability Cap, while also carving out indemnification obligations. For maximum clarity, some draftsmen might explicitly list ""fraud"" alongside ""intentional misconduct.""",5

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel.

You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause you provided (Section 14.4) is an indemnification provision that requires the franchisee (""You"") to indemnify and hold harmless the franchisor and its affiliates (the ""Indemnitees"") for losses arising from the franchisee's operation of the business, with certain exceptions. Here’s how it relates to the query regarding **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct exceptions to a cap on liability via an indemnification carveout**:

### **1. Indemnification Carveout for Gross Negligence**  
The clause explicitly states that the indemnification obligation **does not apply to liability arising from the ""gross negligence"" of the Indemnitees** (the franchisor and its affiliates). This means:  
- The franchisee is **not required to indemnify** the franchisor if the franchisor’s own gross negligence caused the liability.  
- However, if there is **joint or comparative negligence** (where both parties share fault), the franchisee must still indemnify the franchisor for its own proportionate share of liability.  

### **2. Missing Exceptions for Fraud & Willful Misconduct**  
While the clause carves out **gross negligence**, it does **not** explicitly exclude:  
- **Fraud**  
- **Willful misconduct**  

This means:  
- The indemnification obligation **could still apply** even if the franchisor engaged in fraud or willful misconduct, unless another provision in the agreement or applicable law overrides this.  
- Many contracts explicitly exclude fraud and willful misconduct from indemnification to prevent bad actors from benefiting from indemnity. The absence of such exclusions here could be a risk for the franchisee.  

### **3. Relevance to Cap on Liability**  
If the contract has a **separate liability cap** (a limit on damages), the indemnification carveout for gross negligence (but not fraud/willful misconduct) means:  
- The franchisor’s liability for **gross negligence** may be uncapped (since indemnity doesn’t apply).  
- However, liability for **fraud or willful misconduct** might still be **subject to the cap** unless another clause explicitly removes the cap for such conduct.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The clause **partially addresses** the query by excluding **gross negligence** from indemnification.  
- It does **not** fully address **fraud or willful misconduct**, which could leave the franchisee exposed to indemnifying even intentional wrongdoing by the franchisor.  
- If the goal is to ensure that **fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** are all excluded from indemnification (and potentially from liability caps), this clause would need to be amended to explicitly include those exceptions.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### **Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:**
1. **Strict Monetary Cap on Liability**  
   - The seller’s total liability is capped at the **aggregate purchase price paid by the Distributor in the preceding 12 months**, minus any prior claims.  
   - This means the seller’s maximum exposure is tied to recent sales, not potential damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or indirect losses).  

2. **Exclusions Favor the Seller**  
   - The cap does **not** apply to:  
     - **IP misuse** (protecting the seller’s proprietary rights).  
     - **Intentional/willful misconduct** (ensuring bad-faith acts are still punishable).  
     - **Legal non-compliance** (ensuring regulatory obligations remain enforceable).  
   - These carve-outs are **narrow**, meaning most breaches (e.g., delivery delays, product defects) fall under the capped liability.  

3. **Time-Bound Limitation**  
   - The 12-month lookback period ensures liability is tied to **recent transactions**, preventing open-ended exposure from older sales.  

4. **Offset Mechanism**  
   - The clause deducts prior claims from the cap, further reducing the seller’s potential payout.  

### **Why This Benefits the Seller:**  
- **Predictable Risk**: The seller can forecast maximum liability based on sales volume.  
- **Discourages Large Claims**: Distributors may hesitate to sue if recoverable damages are limited.  
- **Balanced Exceptions**: The exclusions protect the seller’s core interests (IP, legal compliance) without broadly exposing them to uncapped liability.  

### **Comparison to Buyer-Favorable Terms:**  
A buyer-favorable clause might:  
- Set the cap at **multiple times** the purchase price (e.g., 2–3x).  
- Include **broader uncapped liabilities** (e.g., indemnification for third-party claims).  
- Extend the lookback period (e.g., 24 months) or omit the offset for prior claims.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause is **strongly seller-favorable** because it minimizes financial risk while maintaining essential protections. Buyers might push back by negotiating:  
- A higher cap (e.g., 1.5x purchase price).  
- Additional uncapped liabilities (e.g., for gross negligence or data breaches).  
- Removal of the offset provision.

seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,f52cb3b7ad,"IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER’S OR SELLER’S LIABILITY, ONE TO THE OTHER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE RESPECTIVE OTHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD 13 MILLION; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BAD FAITH, INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","This clause is a **seller-favorable cap on liability** because it limits the maximum financial exposure of both parties (buyer and seller) to **USD 13 million** for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, or other obligations under the agreement. Here’s why it benefits the seller:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Liability Cap**  
   - The seller’s potential liability is capped at a fixed amount (USD 13 million), protecting them from unlimited or catastrophic financial exposure. This is especially valuable in high-value transactions where claims could otherwise exceed the contract value.

2. **Exceptions Favor the Seller**  
   - The cap does **not** apply to:  
     - **Bad faith, intentional/willful misconduct** (e.g., fraud or deliberate wrongdoing by the seller).  
     - **Third-party claims for personal injury/property damage** caused by a breach.  
   - These exceptions are narrow and standard in most agreements, meaning the seller retains broad protection for ordinary breaches (e.g., unintentional misrepresentations or failures to perform).

3. **Reciprocal but Asymmetric Benefit**  
   - While the clause applies equally to buyer and seller, sellers typically face more liability risks (e.g., breaches of warranties or indemnities). Capping liability at a fixed amount disproportionately shields the seller from larger claims.

4. **Predictability**  
   - The seller can quantify their maximum risk exposure, aiding in risk assessment, insurance planning, and pricing negotiations.

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable (vs. Buyer-Favorable):
- A buyer-favorable version might:  
  - Set a **higher cap** or tie it to the purchase price.  
  - Include **broader exceptions** (e.g., uncapped liability for breaches of fundamental reps/warranties).  
  - Exclude **third-party claims** from the cap entirely.

In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","This **""Limitation of Liability""** clause is highly **seller-favorable** and directly addresses the query by imposing strict **caps on the seller's liability** in multiple ways:  

### **1. Exclusion of Broad Categories of Damages**  
The seller avoids liability for:  
- **Punitive, exemplary, or statutory damages** (waived entirely).  
- **Indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, reputational harm).  
- **Claims under any legal theory** (contract, tort, statute, etc.).  

This significantly **limits the buyer’s potential recovery** to only direct damages.  

### **2. Absolute Financial Cap on Liability**  
The seller’s **maximum liability** is strictly capped at:  
- **The purchase price paid by the buyer** for the product(s) in question, **or**  
- The price of the **defective portion** (whichever is **less**).  

This means the buyer **cannot recover more than what they paid**, even if actual damages (e.g., lost business) far exceed that amount.  

### **3. ""Essential Purpose"" Safeguard**  
Even if a court finds that the **primary remedy** (e.g., repair/replacement) fails, the seller’s liability **still cannot exceed the purchase price**, reinforcing the cap.  

### **Why This is Seller-Favorable**  
- **Shifts risk to the buyer** by excluding common damages (e.g., lost profits).  
- **Prevents large or unpredictable claims** by capping liability at the purchase price.  
- **Broadly shields the seller** from statutory, tort, or punitive claims.  

This clause is **extremely protective of the seller**, making it difficult for the buyer to recover meaningful damages beyond a refund or replacement.

seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","This **limitation of liability clause** is **seller-favorable** (in this case, Fiserv-favorable) for the following reasons:  

### **1. Caps Liability at a Fixed Amount**  
- The clause limits Fiserv’s total liability to **AUD 50,000**, regardless of the type of claim (contract, tort, negligence, etc.).  
- This protects Fiserv from exposure to large, unpredictable damages, which is advantageous for the seller/service provider.  

### **2. Exclusions Favor Fiserv’s Core Obligations**  
While the **AUD 50,000 cap** applies broadly, key exceptions ensure Fiserv remains liable for:  
   - **Remittance of transaction proceeds** (critical for the Merchant’s cash flow).  
   - **The Merchant’s payment obligations** (ensuring Fiserv gets paid).  
These carve-outs protect Fiserv’s revenue streams while still capping other risks.  

### **3. Broad Protection Against Various Claims**  
- The clause covers **""any cause""** and **""regardless of legal theory,""** meaning Fiserv is shielded from contractual breaches, negligence, or other legal claims beyond the cap.  

### **4. No Reciprocal Benefit for the Merchant**  
- The Merchant’s liability is **uncapped** for payment obligations, regulatory fines, and other fees, while Fiserv enjoys a strict liability limit.  
- This asymmetry makes the clause **seller-favorable**.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause strongly favors **Fiserv (the seller/service provider)** by:  
✅ Imposing a strict financial cap on liability.  
✅ Excluding only the most critical obligations (ensuring Fiserv gets paid and avoids regulatory issues).  
✅ Leaving the Merchant exposed to uncapped liabilities in key areas.

seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,42517c5ee6,"LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTY AND LIABILITY:
(d) Seller’s maximum liability for all claims for any reason is the invoice price of the Product(s) involved. Neither Party will be liable to the other Party in contract, tort, negligence, breach of statutory laws, or otherwise for any losses, damages, costs, or expenses of any nature whatsoever that may be incurred or suffered by or in any event could otherwise be awarded to that other Party which are of a special, incidental, punitive, consequential, indirect, or exemplary nature, including, without limitation, any economic loss or other loss of turnover, profits, business, or goodwill.
(e) The remedies set forth in this Section 7 are exclusive, and no other remedy or remedies are available to Buyer, whether in law or equity. Buyer and Seller agree that the remedies contained herein are adequate remedies.","This clause is highly **seller-favorable** in its **cap on liability**, as it significantly limits the seller's exposure to legal and financial risks. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### **1. Strict Cap on Liability (Subsection (d))**
   - The seller’s maximum liability is **capped at the invoice price of the Product(s)** involved, meaning the buyer cannot recover more than what they paid, regardless of the severity of the claim (e.g., breach of contract, negligence, or statutory violations).
   - This is a **hard cap**, preventing claims for **higher-value damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, or reputational harm).

### **2. Exclusion of Consequential & Indirect Damages (Subsection (d))**
   - The seller **explicitly disclaims liability** for **special, incidental, punitive, consequential, or indirect damages**, which are often the most significant in commercial disputes (e.g., lost profits, goodwill, or business opportunities).
   - This is a **strong protective measure**, as buyers typically seek such damages in disputes.

### **3. Exclusive Remedies (Subsection (e))**
   - The clause states that the **only available remedies** are those explicitly listed in the contract (likely limited to refunds, replacements, or repairs).
   - The buyer **waives all other legal or equitable remedies**, preventing lawsuits for additional compensation.

### **Why This is Seller-Favorable**
- **Minimizes Financial Risk**: The seller’s exposure is strictly limited to the product’s price, avoiding unpredictable or catastrophic liabilities.  
- **Blocks High-Value Claims**: By excluding consequential damages, the seller avoids paying for losses that far exceed the contract value.  
- **Legal Certainty**: The ""exclusive remedies"" provision prevents buyers from pursuing alternative claims (e.g., tort or statutory violations).  

### **Potential Buyer Concerns**
- Buyers may find this clause **unfair**, especially if defects cause **significant downstream losses** (e.g., production shutdowns).  
- Courts in some jurisdictions may scrutinize or refuse to enforce **overly restrictive liability caps**, but the clause is drafted broadly to maximize enforceability.  

### **Conclusion**
This is a **strong seller-protective clause**, ensuring the seller’s liability is tightly constrained, making it highly favorable to the seller while shifting most financial risks to the buyer.",5
buyer-favorable cap on liability clauses,395aab365a,"11.3. Liability Cap. Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","This **""Liability Cap"" clause (Section 11.3)** is relevant to a **buyer-favorable cap on liability** in the following ways:  

### **1. General Limitation on Liability**  
The clause imposes a **financial cap** on a party’s liability for most breaches of the agreement, limiting it to:  
> *""The aggregate amount of purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products during the 12 months preceding the claim notification.""*  

This benefits the **buyer (Distributor)** by:  
- **Capping potential exposure** to a predictable, time-bound amount (12 months of payments).  
- **Preventing unlimited liability** for ordinary breaches (e.g., delivery delays, minor contractual non-compliance).  

### **2. Exceptions Where Liability Remains Uncapped**  
However, the clause **excludes** certain high-risk scenarios from the cap, which are typically **seller-favorable** but still relevant to the buyer:  
- **IP infringement** (unauthorized use of Intellectual Property)  
- **Intentional breaches or willful misconduct**  
- **Violations of mandatory laws/regulations**  

For the **buyer**, this means:  
- **They retain full recourse** if the seller acts fraudulently, intentionally breaches, or violates laws.  
- **IP protection** ensures they aren’t left unprotected if the seller misuses third-party IP.  

### **3. Buyer-Favorable Aspects**  
- **Predictability:** The buyer knows their maximum exposure (12 months of payments).  
- **No retroactive liability:** The cap applies only to recent transactions, not the entire contract history.  
- **Deductible-style protection:** If multiple claims arise in the same 12-month window, the cap is reduced by prior payouts, preventing stacking of liabilities.  

### **4. Potential Concerns for Buyers**  
- The cap is **mutual**, meaning the buyer’s liability is also limited—but if the buyer is typically the paying party, this may not be as impactful.  
- The **12-month lookback** could be restrictive if damages stem from long-term issues (buyers might prefer a longer period or a fixed $ cap).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **moderately buyer-favorable** because it:  
✅ Limits liability exposure to a recent, quantifiable amount.  
✅ Excludes egregious misconduct (protecting the buyer from bad-faith acts).  
⚠️ Could be improved by negotiating a **fixed monetary cap** or **extending the lookback period** for certain breaches.

failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","This **limitation of liability clause** is **not buyer-favorable**—it is **neutral or slightly seller-favorable** (protecting Fiserv, the service provider, more than the Merchant). Below is an analysis of its relevance to a **buyer-favorable cap on liability**:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **General Cap on Liability (AUD 50,000)**  
   - Both Fiserv and the Merchant are subject to the same liability cap, which is **not inherently buyer-favorable**.  
   - A **buyer-favorable** version would typically:  
     - Exclude **intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or fraud** from the cap (this clause does not).  
     - Have a **higher cap for the seller (Fiserv)** while keeping the buyer’s (Merchant’s) liability uncapped or higher.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Favoring Fiserv)**  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds (a **core obligation**, so this is reasonable).  
     - The Merchant’s payment obligations (this **protects Fiserv more than the Merchant**).  
   - A **buyer-favorable** clause might instead:  
     - Exclude **only the buyer’s (Merchant’s) critical risks** (e.g., fraud, breach of confidentiality).  
     - **Not exclude the seller’s payment obligations** (here, the Merchant’s payment duties are excluded from the cap, which is **not buyer-friendly**).  

3. **No Carve-Outs for Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct**  
   - A **buyer-favorable** clause would typically **exclude these** from the cap, but this clause does not.  

### **Conclusion:**
This clause is **not buyer-favorable** because:  
- It **equally caps both parties’ liability** (no advantage to the buyer).  
- It **excludes the Merchant’s payment obligations** (benefiting Fiserv).  
- It **does not exclude Fiserv’s gross negligence or intentional breaches** (which a buyer would want).  

For a **buyer-favorable** version, the Merchant (buyer) should negotiate:  
✔ **Higher liability cap for Fiserv** (or uncapped for certain risks).  
✔ **Exclusions for Fiserv’s fraud, negligence, or breach of core obligations**.  
✔ **No broad exclusions of the Merchant’s own liabilities**.

### **1. General Cap on Liability**  
- The clause imposes a **maximum liability limit of USD 13 million** for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, or other obligations under the agreement.  
- This benefits the **buyer** by capping their potential exposure if they breach the contract, ensuring they are not subject to unlimited damages.  

### **2. Exceptions Favoring the Buyer**  
While the cap applies to most breaches, the clause **excludes** certain high-risk scenarios where liability remains uncapped, which can be **buyer-favorable** in key ways:  
- **Bad Faith / Willful Misconduct**: If the **seller** acts in bad faith or engages in intentional wrongdoing, they remain fully liable (no cap). This protects the buyer from egregious misconduct.  
- **Third-Party Claims (Personal Injury / Property Damage)**: If a breach leads to third-party claims (e.g., defective products causing harm), the seller’s liability is **uncapped**, ensuring the buyer is not left exposed to large third-party lawsuits.  

### **3. Balanced but Buyer-Protective**  
- The clause is **mutual** (applies to both parties), but the exceptions disproportionately protect the buyer because:  
  - The buyer is more likely to face third-party claims (e.g., if the seller’s product causes harm).  
  - The buyer is shielded from unlimited liability for ordinary breaches but retains recourse for seller misconduct.  

### **Conclusion**  
This is a **moderately buyer-favorable** clause because:  
✅ **Limits the buyer’s liability** for most breaches.  
✅ **Preserves uncapped liability** for seller misconduct and third-party risks.

Below is an analysis of how it relates to a **buyer-favorable cap on liability** (which would typically seek broader protections for the buyer):  

### **Key Seller-Favorable Aspects (Unfavorable to Buyer):**  
1. **Exclusion of Key Damages:**  
   - The seller disclaims liability for **indirect, special, incidental, and consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, reputational harm).  
   - The buyer cannot recover **punitive, exemplary, or statutory damages**, even if applicable under law.  

2. **Strict Cap on Liability:**  
   - The seller’s **maximum liability** is limited to the **purchase price paid** (or the price of the defective portion, if lower).  
   - This means the buyer cannot recover **full losses** if damages exceed the product cost.  

3. **Failure of Essential Purpose:**  
   - Even if the agreed remedy (e.g., repair/replacement) fails, the liability **still does not exceed the purchase price**, which is restrictive for the buyer.  

### **How a Buyer-Favorable Clause Would Differ:**  
A **buyer-friendly** version might:  
- **Allow recovery of consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) if caused by seller negligence or breach.  
- **Increase the liability cap** (e.g., to a multiple of the purchase price or a fixed higher amount).  
- **Exclude certain breaches** (e.g., gross negligence, willful misconduct, IP infringement) from the cap.  
- **Preserve statutory claims** where waivers are unenforceable.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause heavily favors the **seller** by severely limiting the buyer’s recourse. A **buyer-favorable** version would relax these restrictions, allowing broader recovery in case of significant harm.

However, the query asks for a **buyer-favorable cap on liability**, so this clause is the opposite of what a buyer would typically want. Below is an analysis of how this clause is unfavorable to the buyer and what a buyer-favorable version might look like:

### **Key Seller-Favorable Aspects (Unfavorable to Buyer):**
1. **Limited Remedies** – The buyer’s sole remedies are replacement or refund (Section 11(a)), with no option for additional compensation (e.g., damages for business disruption).  
2. **Liability Cap** – Seller’s maximum liability is capped at the purchase price of the goods/services (Section 11(b)), meaning the buyer cannot recover for larger losses (e.g., lost profits, recall costs, or third-party claims).  
3. **Exclusion of Consequential & Indirect Damages** – Seller explicitly disclaims liability for lost profits, incidental, or punitive damages (Section 11(c)), even if the remedy fails.  
4. **No Liability for Removal/Replacement Costs** – Seller avoids responsibility for labor, disposal, or installation costs (Section 11(b)), shifting these expenses to the buyer.  
5. **No Third-Party Liability** – Seller is only liable to the buyer, not downstream customers (Section 11(b)), forcing the buyer to indemnify the seller in its own contracts.  

### **How a Buyer-Favorable Cap on Liability Would Differ:**
A buyer-favorable version would typically include:  
- **Higher liability cap** (e.g., multiple times the purchase price or uncapped for certain breaches).  
- **Allowance for consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits if foreseeable).  
- **Coverage for removal/replacement costs** (e.g., labor, disposal).  
- **Survival of liability for gross negligence/willful misconduct** (this clause does not carve out such exceptions).  
- **No blanket exclusion of third-party claims** (buyer may want seller to cover claims from its own customers).  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause is **not buyer-favorable**—it heavily favors the seller by minimizing exposure. A buyer negotiating for better terms would push back on the strict liability cap, exclusions, and lack of recourse for consequential losses.

non-reliance clause,dd24d14bea,"20. No Reliance No third party is entitled to rely on any of the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement. The Parties assume no liability to any third party because of any reliance on the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement.","The **non-reliance clause** (Clause 20 in your example) is a contractual provision that explicitly limits the ability of third parties to rely on the representations, warranties, or agreements made between the parties to the contract. Here’s how it relates to your query:

### Key Relevance to ""Non-Reliance Clause"":
1. **Purpose**:  
   - The clause clarifies that **only the parties to the agreement** (not third parties) can rely on its terms.  
   - It shields the parties from liability if an external party (e.g., a customer, investor, or competitor) attempts to claim rights or damages based on the contract’s content.

2. **Legal Protection**:  
   - Prevents third parties from asserting claims (e.g., misrepresentation or breach) by stating they were not intended beneficiaries of the contract.  
   - Reinforces **privity of contract**, a legal doctrine that limits rights/obligations to the contracting parties unless expressly extended.

3. **Risk Mitigation**:  
   - Reduces exposure to disputes from outsiders who might argue they acted based on the contract’s terms.  
   - Common in agreements involving sensitive disclosures (e.g., M&A, commercial contracts) where unintended reliance could lead to liability.

4. **Example Scenario**:  
   - If a supplier’s customer reads a warranty in a contract between the supplier and a manufacturer, the customer cannot sue the manufacturer for breaching that warranty—because the clause explicitly excludes third-party reliance.

### Why It Matters for Your Query:  
This clause directly addresses the concept of **non-reliance** by disclaiming liability to third parties and reinforcing the contractual boundaries. It ensures the agreement’s terms are enforceable only between the signatories, not outsiders.

### **Key Elements of the Clause:**  
1. **No Third-Party Rights** – The agreement is only enforceable by the parties involved, not by any other persons.  
2. **Anti-Assignment** – Neither party can transfer its rights or obligations under the agreement without consent.  

### **Relevance to a Non-Reliance Clause**  
A **non-reliance clause** typically states that the parties have not relied on any representations, warranties, or statements outside the written agreement when entering into the contract. This is common in commercial agreements to prevent claims of misrepresentation.  

Your clause does **not** address reliance or disclaim pre-contractual statements. If you need a **non-reliance clause**, it might look something like this:  

> *""Each party acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement, it has not relied on any representation, warranty, or statement not expressly set out in this Agreement.""*

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.","The clause you provided is a **non-reliance clause**, which is directly relevant to your query. Here’s how it functions in the context of a contract:

### **Key Aspects of the Non-Reliance Clause:**
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly states that **no representations or warranties** (other than those expressly stated in the agreement) are made by either party.  
   - This includes **implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement), which might otherwise arise under common law or statutory provisions (e.g., the UCC in the U.S.).

2. **Purpose: Limiting Liability & Defining Reliance**  
   - The clause ensures that neither party can later claim they relied on **oral statements, past dealings, or industry norms** outside the written contract.  
   - It prevents disputes where one party argues they were misled by **extra-contractual assurances**.

3. **Legal Effect**  
   - Courts generally enforce such clauses if they are **clear and unambiguous**, reinforcing the principle of **contractual certainty**.  
   - It shifts risk to the parties to ensure they **negotiate and document all critical terms** within the agreement itself.

### **Relevance to ""Non-Reliance""**  
A **non-reliance clause** (like this one) confirms that:  
- The parties are **not relying on any statements outside the contract**.  
- They are **bound only by the express terms** of the agreement.  
- Any claims based on **misrepresentation** (outside the contract) are likely barred.  

This is crucial in **M&A deals, commercial contracts, and IP agreements**, where parties want to avoid liability for **pre-contractual discussions** or **unwritten promises**.

### **Example Scenario**  
If Party A later sues Party B, claiming, *""You orally promised the software would never fail!""*, Party B can point to this clause to argue:  
- The contract **disclaims all warranties not in writing**.  
- Party A **agreed not to rely** on any such oral assurances.

Except as set forth in paragraphs 9(a) through 9(d) inclusive of this agreement, with respect to its EDP services or other work provided under this agreement, VIP makes no warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose except as set forth in paragraphs 9(a) through 9(d) inclusive of this agreement, VIP does not warrant that the services shall meet BNL's requirements or that the services shall be uninterrupted or error-free.","The clause you provided is a **limited warranty and disclaimer clause**, which is closely related to a **non-reliance clause** in its intent and effect. Here’s how it connects to the concept of a non-reliance clause:

### **Relevance to a Non-Reliance Clause**  
A **non-reliance clause** is a contractual provision where one or both parties confirm that they are not relying on any representations, warranties, or assurances outside of those explicitly stated in the agreement. Its purpose is to limit liability for pre-contractual statements and ensure that obligations are strictly defined by the written terms.

In your clause:  
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties** – VIP explicitly disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) except those expressly stated in paragraphs 9(a)-9(d). This means BNL cannot claim it relied on any unwritten promises or industry-standard expectations beyond what is contractually guaranteed.  
   
2. **No Guarantee of Uninterrupted/Error-Free Service** – By stating that VIP does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free services, the clause reinforces that BNL should not rely on such expectations unless explicitly agreed elsewhere in the contract.  

3. **Limited Scope of Reliance** – The clause confines BNL’s reliance to only the warranties in paragraphs 9(a)-9(d), effectively functioning as a **partial non-reliance clause** by negating dependence on any other assurances (oral, implied, or otherwise).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
While not labeled as a ""non-reliance clause,"" this provision achieves a similar effect by:  
- Disclaiming extra-contractual assurances,  
- Limiting BNL’s reliance to only the specified warranties, and  
- Shielding VIP from claims based on assumptions or informal promises.  

If the query seeks a **standalone non-reliance clause**, this clause could be supplemented with broader language (e.g., ""BNL acknowledges it has not relied on any representations outside this agreement""). However, as written, it serves a parallel risk-allocation function.

ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.","The clause you provided (Section 13.4) is a **non-reliance clause**, though it is framed as a disclaimer of representations and warranties. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of a non-reliance clause and why it’s relevant to your query:

### **Key Aspects of a Non-Reliance Clause:**
1. **Purpose**: A non-reliance clause confirms that parties are not relying on any statements, assurances, or information outside the express terms of the agreement. It limits liability for pre-contractual representations or implied warranties.

2. **Exclusion of Extra-Contractual Statements**: The clause explicitly states that **no representations or warranties** (express or implied) exist outside those ""expressly stated in this agreement."" This prevents a party from later claiming they relied on oral or written assurances not included in the final contract.

3. **Disclaimers of Implied Terms**: The clause excludes common implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement) that might otherwise arise by law (e.g., under the UCC or common law). This reinforces that the parties are only bound by the written terms.

4. **Legal Effect**: By disclaiming extra-contractual representations, the clause helps defend against claims of misrepresentation, fraud, or breach of warranty based on statements made during negotiations.

### **Relevance to Your Query:**
- The clause functions as a **non-reliance mechanism** by ensuring that neither party can assert they entered the agreement based on undocumented promises or assumptions.  
- It shifts risk to the parties to ensure all critical terms are included in the agreement itself.  
- Courts generally enforce such clauses unless there is fraud or bad faith, making them a key tool in contract risk allocation.  

### **Drafting Note:**
For even stronger non-reliance language, some contracts include an explicit acknowledgment (e.g., *""Each party acknowledges that it has not relied on any representation or warranty not expressly set forth in this Agreement.""*). Your clause achieves a similar effect through its broad disclaimer.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (A) NO PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE MATERIALS AND SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE, PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND ALL SUCH MATERIALS AND SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE, ARE PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS AND (B) EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON- INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.","The clause you provided is a standard **""as-is"" disclaimer** and is directly relevant to your query about an **""as-is"" clause**. Here’s how it aligns with the concept:

### Key Elements of an ""As-Is"" Clause:
1. **No Warranties** – The clause explicitly states that **no party makes any representations or warranties** (express or implied) about the materials or services provided under the agreement, except as expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement.  
   - This means the subject matter is provided **without guarantees** regarding quality, performance, or suitability.

2. **""As Is"" Basis** – The clause specifies that materials/services are provided **""as is,""** meaning the recipient accepts them in their existing condition, with all faults and without recourse if issues arise.

3. **Disclaimers of Implied Warranties** – The clause **explicitly disclaims** common implied warranties, including:  
   - **Merchantability** (that the goods/services are fit for ordinary use)  
   - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (that they meet specific needs)  
   - **Non-Infringement** (that they don’t violate third-party rights)  

### Relevance to Your Query:
- This clause is a **strong example of an ""as-is"" provision** because it:  
  - Limits liability by excluding warranties not expressly stated.  
  - Shifts risk to the recipient by emphasizing the ""as-is"" nature of the transaction.  
  - Aligns with common legal interpretations of ""as-is"" in contracts (e.g., under the UCC for goods or general contract law).  

### Practical Effect:
- The recipient **cannot later claim** they were misled about quality or performance unless a warranty was explicitly given elsewhere in the agreement.  
- Courts generally enforce such clauses unless there is fraud, unconscionability, or statutory overrides (e.g., consumer protection laws).

Here’s a breakdown of its key implications:

### 1. **""As Is"" Provision**  
   - The clause states that services are provided **""as is""**, meaning the recipient accepts them **without any assurances** of quality, performance, or reliability. This shifts the risk of potential defects or failures to the receiving party (e.g., the customer or licensee).

### 2. **Exclusion of Warranties**  
   - The clause **denies all representations, warranties, or conditions** (express or implied), including but not limited to:  
     - **Implied warranties of merchantability** (i.e., the service is fit for ordinary purposes).  
     - **Fitness for a particular purpose** (i.e., suitability for the recipient’s specific needs).  
     - **Uninterrupted/error-free operation** (e.g., no guarantees about uptime or functionality of web services, ads, or links).  
   - This protects the provider (MLX/HCI) from liability if the services fail to meet expectations.

### 3. **Exceptions**  
   - The disclaimer **does not apply** to:  
     - Warranties **explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement**.  
     - Terms **agreed to in writing by both parties** (e.g., a separate service-level agreement).  

### 4. **Legal Purpose**  
   - The clause aims to **limit the provider’s liability** by ensuring the recipient cannot later claim reliance on unwritten promises or industry standards.  
   - It aligns with common contract law principles (e.g., the UCC’s allowance for ""as-is"" sales) and may override implied warranties under statutes like the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)** or consumer protection laws, unless prohibited.  

### Why It Matters for Your Query  
If you’re reviewing this clause, you likely need to understand:  
- **Risk Allocation**: The recipient assumes all risks related to service quality.  
- **Negotiation Opportunities**: The clause allows for carve-outs if the parties agree in writing.  
- **Enforceability**: Courts generally uphold ""as-is"" clauses unless unconscionable or fraudulent.

Here’s how it aligns with the concept of an ""as-is"" provision:

### Key Elements of the ""As-Is"" Clause:
1. **Disclaimer of Warranties**:  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **all representations and warranties** (both express and implied) regarding the trademarks and associated rights, unless specifically stated elsewhere in the contract.  
   - This includes disclaiming implied warranties like **title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose**—standard in ""as-is"" agreements.

2. **Limitation of Liability**:  
   - The clause states that the ""AS Parties"" (likely the assignor/seller) will not be liable for **any damages** arising from the use of the trademarks or rights.  
   - It further excludes liability for **special, consequential, or punitive damages**, reinforcing the ""as-is"" nature by shielding the provider from broader legal risks.

3. **Purpose of an ""As-Is"" Clause**:  
   - Such clauses ensure the recipient (here, MusclePharm) accepts the trademarks and rights **without guarantees** about their quality, legality, or suitability.  
   - It shifts the risk of defects, infringement, or other issues to the recipient, protecting the provider from future claims.

### Relevance to Your Query:  
The clause embodies the core intent of an ""as-is"" provision by:  
- Clearly stating that the trademarks/rights are transferred **without warranties**.  
- Limiting the provider’s liability for **any problems** arising from their use.  
- Emphasizing the recipient’s assumption of risk (common in asset sales, IP licensing, or mergers).  

### Practical Implications:  
- **MusclePharm** (the licensee/buyer) cannot later sue the ""AS Parties"" for issues like infringement or poor performance of the trademarks.  
- Courts generally uphold such clauses if they are **conspicuous and unambiguous**, as this one appears to be.

Here’s how it aligns with the concept of an ""as-is"" provision:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **""As-Is"" Statement**:  
   - The clause states that the licenses granted are provided **""as-is""**, meaning the recipient accepts them in their current condition, with all faults and without any guarantees.

2. **Exclusion of Warranties**:  
   - It disclaims **all warranties**, whether **express** (explicitly stated), **implied** (automatically arising by law, e.g., merchantability or fitness for a purpose), or **statutory** (required by legislation).  
   - Specific examples of excluded warranties include:  
     - **Merchantability** (the product/service is fit for ordinary use).  
     - **Fitness for a particular purpose** (suitability for the licensee’s specific needs).  
     - **Title/non-infringement** (assurances that the licensor owns the rights and the license doesn’t violate third-party rights).  

3. **Broad Disclaimer Language**:  
   - The phrase **""any other warranty whatsoever""** ensures no loopholes exist—even warranties not explicitly listed are excluded.

### Relevance to Your Query:  
An ""as-is"" clause shifts risk from the licensor/provider to the licensee/recipient by:  
- **Limiting liability**: The licensor avoids legal claims if the licensed material is defective or unusable.  
- **Managing expectations**: The recipient acknowledges they are not relying on any promises about quality or performance.  
- **Complying with law**: Explicitly disclaiming implied warranties (like merchantability) is often required under laws such as the UCC (U.S.) or similar consumer protection statutes.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **For licensors**: Protects against lawsuits for defects or failures.  
- **For licensees**: Signals the need for independent due diligence (e.g., testing the licensed software/product before relying on it).

Kubient makes no representation or warranty and expressly disclaims, and Customer understands and acknowledges, that there is no guarantee that any minimum level of revenue or profit will be generated by either Party as a result of the Services or this Agreement.","The **""as-is"" clause** in the provided contract (Section 13: **Disclaimer**) is a critical legal provision that limits the liability of the provider (**Kubient**) by disclaiming most warranties and guarantees regarding the **Services**. Here’s how it directly addresses your query about an **""as-is"" clause**:

### Key Aspects of the ""As-Is"" Clause:
1. **No Implied Warranties**  
   - The Services are provided **""as is,"" ""where is,"" and ""as available""**, meaning Kubient does not guarantee their functionality, quality, or fitness for a particular purpose beyond what is **explicitly stated in the Agreement**.
   - The clause **waives all implied warranties** that might otherwise apply under law (e.g., merchantability, fitness for purpose, or warranties arising from trade practice).

2. **Exclusion of Guarantees**  
   - Kubient explicitly states that there is **no guarantee** of any **minimum revenue or profit** resulting from the Services or Agreement. This protects Kubient from claims if the Services do not meet the Customer’s expectations.

3. **Waiver by Customer**  
   - The Customer **expressly acknowledges and waives** any claims based on implied warranties or representations not stated in the Agreement. This shifts risk to the Customer, who accepts the Services with all potential flaws.

### Relevance to Your Query:  
An **""as-is"" clause** is designed to:  
- **Limit liability** for the provider (Kubient) by disclaiming responsibility for issues not expressly promised.  
- **Shift risk** to the Customer, who agrees to accept the Services without assurances beyond the contract’s explicit terms.  
- **Prevent claims** based on unwritten expectations or general industry standards.  

This clause is **standard in contracts** where one party (here, Kubient) wants to avoid being held liable for unforeseen problems or failures in performance. It reinforces that the Customer is responsible for evaluating the Services before relying on them.

Except as provided in Section 1.2 of this Development Agreement, Cargill makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, with respect to the services provided under this Development Agreement and with respect to the subject matter of this Development Agreement. The services are provided ""as is"" and Bioamber acknowledges that it bears all responsibility and accountability for evaluating, approving, and implementing any of results resulting from this Development Agreement.","The query asks about an **""as is"" clause with carveouts**, and the provided clause is a clear example of such a provision. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **""As Is"" Clause**  
The clause explicitly states that the services are provided **""as is""**, meaning Cargill disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) and limits its liability for defects or shortcomings in the services. This shifts the risk to Bioamber, which must independently evaluate and accept the services without reliance on Cargill’s assurances.

### 2. **Carveouts (Exceptions)**  
The clause includes a carveout by referencing **Section 1.2** of the Development Agreement. This means that, despite the broad ""as is"" disclaimer, certain representations or warranties may still apply as specified in Section 1.2. Carveouts are exceptions to disclaimers, often negotiated to preserve specific protections or assurances.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause demonstrates a **standard ""as is"" disclaimer** with a **limited carveout**, addressing the query’s focus on how exceptions modify such provisions.  
- It highlights the **allocation of risk**: Bioamber assumes responsibility for evaluating the services, while Cargill avoids liability except for what’s expressly stated in Section 1.2.  
- This structure is common in contracts where one party (e.g., a developer or seller) seeks to limit warranties, but the other party (e.g., a buyer or client) negotiates carveouts for critical protections.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (A) NO PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE MATERIALS AND SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE, PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND ALL SUCH MATERIALS AND SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE, ARE PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS"" BASIS AND (B) EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON- INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.","The **""as is"" clause with carveouts** in your query refers to a contractual provision where one or both parties disclaim all warranties and representations about the subject matter of the agreement, except for specific exceptions (carveouts) explicitly stated elsewhere in the contract. 

### **Relevance to the Provided Clause:**
1. **""As Is"" Basis**  
   The clause explicitly states that all materials and services are provided **""on an 'as is' basis""**, meaning the recipient accepts them with all faults and without any guarantees unless otherwise specified.

2. **Disclaimer of Warranties**  
   The clause broadly disclaims all **express and implied warranties**, including:  
   - Implied warranty of **merchantability** (fitness for ordinary use)  
   - Implied warranty of **fitness for a particular purpose**  
   - Implied warranty of **non-infringement**  

3. **Carveouts (""Except as Expressly Set Forth"")**  
   The clause includes a **carveout** by stating that the disclaimer applies **""except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.""** This means:  
   - If another section of the agreement provides **specific warranties or guarantees**, those will still apply.  
   - The ""as is"" disclaimer does **not override** any affirmative promises made elsewhere in the contract.  

### **Why This Matters in Contracts**  
- **Risk Allocation:** The ""as is"" clause shifts risk to the recipient by limiting the provider’s liability.  
- **Carveouts Protect Certain Rights:** If the agreement elsewhere includes representations (e.g., ""Seller warrants title to the goods""), those survive despite the general disclaimer.  
- **Common in M&A, Sales, and Service Agreements:** Such clauses are typical in asset sales, software licenses, and service contracts where the provider wants to limit exposure to warranty claims.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is a **strong ""as is"" disclaimer** but allows for **negotiated exceptions** (carveouts) elsewhere in the agreement. If no carveouts exist, the recipient has **no recourse** for defects unless fraud or gross negligence is proven. If carveouts exist, they define the **only enforceable warranties**.

This clause shall survive termination of this JSMA.","The query asks about an **""as is"" clause with carveouts**, but the provided clause is an **indemnification clause** (not an ""as is"" clause). However, I can explain the relevance and distinctions between these concepts and how they might interact in a contract.

### Key Differences:
1. **""As Is"" Clause**:  
   - Typically disclaims all warranties and shifts risk to the buyer/recipient by stating that the subject matter (e.g., goods, services, or assets) is accepted in its current condition, with no guarantees.  
   - Example language: *""Vertex provides the services 'as is' and disclaims all warranties, express or implied.""*  

2. **Indemnification Clause (Provided Clause)**:  
   - Requires one party to compensate the other for losses arising from specific acts (e.g., negligence, breach of contract).  
   - Here, Vertex and Bunker One mutually agree to indemnify each other for damages caused by their own negligence, gross negligence, intentional acts, or breaches.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- While not an ""as is"" clause, the indemnification clause **complements** an ""as is"" provision by addressing liability carveouts.  
- An ""as is"" clause might exclude warranties, but **carveouts** (exceptions) could preserve indemnification rights for certain risks (e.g., gross negligence or intentional misconduct).  
- In this case, the indemnification clause acts as a **carveout to broad liability limitations** by ensuring parties remain responsible for their own wrongful acts, even if the contract otherwise disclaims liability (""as is"").  

### Practical Interaction:
If the contract included an ""as is"" clause, it might state:  
*""Services are provided 'as is' with no warranties, except as provided in Section 12 (Indemnification).""*  
Here, the indemnification clause **carves out** liability for negligence/breaches, overriding the general ""as is"" risk allocation.  

### Conclusion:
The provided clause is not an ""as is"" clause but serves a related purpose by **defining carveouts to liability limitations**. In a full contract, it would work alongside (or override) an ""as is"" provision to ensure specific risks (e.g., gross negligence) are not waived.

Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors, agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.","The clause you provided is **not** a traditional **""as is"" clause with carveouts**, but it does contain elements related to liability limitation and indemnification, which are sometimes addressed in conjunction with ""as is"" provisions. Here’s the relevance to your query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **""Maximum Obligation"" Limitation**:  
   - The clause caps the Sponsor's liability at the sponsorship fee (plus potential collection costs). This resembles the risk-allocation function of an ""as is"" clause, which typically disclaims warranties and limits liability for defects or unforeseen issues.  
   - However, it lacks explicit ""as is"" language (e.g., disclaiming implied warranties or stating the Sponsor accepts risks in their current state).

2. **Indemnification Carveout**:  
   - Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor for losses **exceeding the Maximum Obligation**, but only if those losses arise from:  
     - (i) The Agreement itself, or  
     - (ii) Racing’s failure to perform its obligations.  
   - This acts as a **carveout** to the Sponsor’s limited liability, shifting certain risks back to Racing.  

### Comparison to a Typical ""As Is"" Clause with Carveouts:
- An **""as is"" clause** would explicitly state that the Sponsor accepts the subject matter (e.g., an event, asset, or service) in its current condition, with all faults, and disclaims warranties.  
- **Carveouts** might then exempt specific liabilities (e.g., gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or third-party claims) from the ""as is"" protection.  

In your clause:  
- The **liability cap** functions similarly to an ""as is"" provision by limiting exposure.  
- The **indemnification** acts as a carveout, ensuring Racing covers certain excess liabilities (e.g., its own breaches).  

### Why It Doesn’t Fully Match the Query:  
The clause is **not a standalone ""as is"" clause** but achieves a similar goal (risk allocation) through a liability limit paired with indemnification. To align with the query, explicit ""as is"" language and broader carveouts (e.g., for fraud or statutory violations) would typically be included.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AS PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.","This clause is a classic **""as is"" clause with carveouts**, which aligns directly with your query. Here's how it breaks down:

### 1. **""As Is"" Disclaimer**  
The clause states that the trademarks and related rights are provided **""as is""**, meaning the recipient (MusclePharm) accepts them with all faults and without any warranties unless explicitly stated otherwise. The language broadly disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., title, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness for a purpose), which is typical of an ""as is"" provision.

### 2. **Carveouts**  
The phrase **""except as specifically set forth herein""** acts as a carveout. It preserves any **express warranties or representations** made elsewhere in the agreement. For example, if another section guarantees that the trademarks are validly registered, that promise would override this disclaimer.  

### 3. **Limitation of Liability**  
The clause further limits liability by:  
- Excluding damages arising from the use of the trademarks.  
- Barring claims for **special, consequential, or punitive damages** (a common cap on exposure).  

### **Relevance to Your Query**  
This clause fits the ""as is with carveouts"" structure because:  
- It disclaims **all implied warranties** (the ""as is"" baseline).  
- It **carves out exceptions** for any express promises made in the contract.  
- It reinforces the ""as is"" nature by **limiting remedies** for breaches.

Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Features of an Unqualified ""As Is"" Clause:
1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties**:  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **all representations and warranties** (both express and implied) except those expressly stated in the agreement.  
   - The phrase **""AS IS""** reinforces that the materials/services are provided without any guarantees about their condition, quality, or performance.

2. **Waiver of Implied Warranties**:  
   - It specifically disclaims implied warranties that might otherwise apply under law, such as:  
     - **Merchantability** (the product is fit for ordinary use).  
     - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (the product meets the buyer’s specific needs).  
     - **Non-Infringement** (the product doesn’t violate third-party rights).  

3. **No Exceptions or Carve-Outs**:  
   - The disclaimer is **unqualified**—it applies universally unless expressly contradicted elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., in a separate warranties section).  
   - There are no limitations (e.g., for known defects, latent issues, or statutory rights that cannot be waived).

### Relevance to the Query:
- The query asks about an **unqualified ""as is"" clause**, and this clause fits that description because:  
  - It uses the explicit **""AS IS""** language.  
  - It disclaims **all implied warranties** without exception.  
  - It does not include qualifications (e.g., ""except as required by law"" or ""to the fullest extent permitted by law""), which might otherwise soften its effect.  

### Potential Risks:
- In some jurisdictions, courts may scrutinize or limit such clauses if they are deemed **unconscionable** or if they conflict with mandatory consumer protection laws.  
- If the agreement includes conflicting promises (e.g., detailed warranties elsewhere), the disclaimer’s enforceability could be challenged.  

### Drafting Tip:
To make the clause more balanced (if desired), parties might:  
- Add exceptions (e.g., for **fraud** or **willful misconduct**).  
- Include language like **""to the fullest extent permitted by law""** to account for jurisdictional limitations.

Here's how it relates to the query:

### **1. Definition of an Unqualified ""As Is"" Clause**  
An ""as is"" clause disclaims all warranties (express or implied) and shifts the risk of defects or non-performance entirely to the receiving party. An **unqualified** version means there are **no exceptions or carve-outs** beyond what is strictly stated in the contract.

### **2. Relevance to the Query**  
The clause in question is **unqualified** because:  
- It broadly states that services are provided **""as is""** with **no guarantees**.  
- It **excludes all implied warranties** (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, etc.).  
- The only exceptions are those **specifically provided in the agreement** or **agreed in writing**—but these are not detailed here, making the disclaimer sweeping.  

### **3. Key Issues with an Unqualified ""As Is"" Clause**  
- **Enforceability Risk:** Some jurisdictions limit or invalidate overly broad disclaimers, especially if they conflict with consumer protection laws or statutory rights.  
- **Potential Unfairness:** If one party has significantly more bargaining power, courts may scrutinize such clauses for unconscionability.  
- **Ambiguity in Exceptions:** The phrase *""except as specifically provided herein""* is vague—if no other warranties are listed, the clause remains effectively absolute.  

### **4. Comparison Between Subsection (a) and (b)**  
Both subsections reinforce the ""as is"" nature of the services, but:  
- **(a)** applies to **MLX** (disclaiming warranties on the *Sympatico Web Site*).  
- **(b)** applies to **HCI** (disclaiming warranties on the *co-branded Web Site*).  
The repetition suggests both parties are mutually disclaiming liability, but the broad language keeps it **unqualified**.  

### **5. Practical Implications**  
- The recipient of services (e.g., a customer or partner) assumes **all risk** of defects, errors, or non-performance.  
- The provider (MLX/HCI) avoids liability even for **negligence** in some cases, unless the contract or law explicitly requires otherwise.  

### **Recommendation for Improvement**  
To mitigate enforceability risks, consider:  
- **Qualifying the clause** (e.g., ""to the fullest extent permitted by law"").  
- **Listing specific exclusions** (e.g., ""except for warranties expressly stated in Section X"").  
- **Ensuring compliance with local laws** (some jurisdictions void disclaimers of implied warranties in consumer contracts).

Here's how it relates:

### Key Elements of an Unqualified ""As Is"" Clause:
1. **Exclusion of All Other Warranties**:  
   The clause explicitly states that the **only** representations/warranties applicable are those expressly stated in the agreement. All others—whether **express, implied, or statutory**—are disclaimed. This creates an ""as is"" basis for the transaction.

2. **Specific Waiver of Implied Warranties**:  
   It targets well-known implied warranties under U.S. law (e.g., **merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement**), which would otherwise automatically apply unless disclaimed. This is a hallmark of unqualified ""as is"" terms.

3. **No Limitations or Exceptions**:  
   The disclaimer is **absolute** (""in lieu of all other representations"") and lacks carve-outs (e.g., for fraud, gross negligence, or known defects). This makes it ""unqualified,"" meaning it leaves no room for alternative claims.

### Relevance to Your Query:
- The clause aligns with the concept of an **unqualified ""as is"" provision** because it:  
  - Broadly negates all warranties beyond the contract’s express terms.  
  - Does not soften the disclaimer with qualifications (e.g., ""except as prohibited by law"" or ""to the fullest extent permitted"").  
  - Explicitly rejects implied warranties that might otherwise protect the counterparty.  

### Potential Risks:
- **Enforceability Issues**: Some jurisdictions limit blanket disclaimers (e.g., consumer protection laws or anti-waiver rules for fraud).  
- **Hidden Defects**: The clause could expose the counterparty to undisclosed risks, as they assume all responsibility for flaws.  

If you need to qualify the clause (e.g., for fairness or compliance), you might add exceptions or language like ""to the extent permitted by applicable law."" Let me know if you'd like drafting alternatives.",5

ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.","The clause you provided is a broad **""as is"" disclaimer** that seeks to exclude all representations and warranties not expressly stated in the agreement. It is relevant to your query about an **""unqualified 'as is' clause""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Broad Exclusion of Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **all implied warranties**, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, unless expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement.  
   - This is a hallmark of an **""as is"" provision**, meaning the recipient accepts the subject matter of the contract in its current condition, with no assurances beyond what is written.

### 2. **Unqualified Nature**  
   - The disclaimer is **unqualified** because it does not contain exceptions (other than those ""expressly stated in this agreement"").  
   - Some agreements may include carve-outs (e.g., for fraud, willful misconduct, or statutory warranties), but this clause does not, making it particularly strong in favor of the disclaiming party.

### 3. **Relevance to Legal Risk**  
   - In many jurisdictions (e.g., under the UCC in the U.S.), implied warranties apply unless properly disclaimed. This clause complies with that requirement by using **clear and conspicuous language**.  
   - However, if the agreement involves consumer transactions or certain regulated industries, such an unqualified disclaimer may be **unenforceable** under consumer protection laws.  

### 4. **Potential Issues**  
   - If the agreement involves a sale of goods, courts may scrutinize whether the disclaimer is **sufficiently conspicuous** (e.g., bold, capitalized, or separately acknowledged).  
   - In some cases, **fraudulent misrepresentation** or **gross negligence** may still create liability despite such a clause.  

### **Conclusion**  
This is a strong, **unqualified ""as is"" clause** that effectively eliminates most implied warranties, shifting risk to the counterparty. However, its enforceability depends on jurisdiction, context, and whether any mandatory protections (e.g., consumer laws) override it.

It is relevant to your query about an **""unqualified 'as is' clause""** because it is a strong, unqualified exclusion of implied warranties and other legal protections that might otherwise apply.  

### Key Aspects of the Clause:  
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties** – The clause explicitly disclaims all implied warranties, including **merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement**, unless expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement.  
2. **""As Is"" Nature** – By stating that no representations or warranties are made except those explicitly provided, the clause effectively imposes an **""as is, where is""** condition on the subject matter of the agreement.  
3. **Broad Scope** – The disclaimer applies to warranties arising **""by operation of law or otherwise,""** meaning it seeks to override statutory or common-law protections (e.g., UCC Article 2 warranties in the U.S.).  
4. **No Qualifications** – Unlike some ""as is"" clauses that may have carve-outs (e.g., for fraud or gross negligence), this one is **unqualified**, meaning it does not preserve any exceptions beyond what is expressly stated in the agreement.  

### Relevance to Your Query:  
An **""unqualified 'as is' clause""** means there are no limitations or exceptions to the disclaimer of warranties beyond what is explicitly written in the contract. This clause fits that description because:  
- It does not allow for **implied warranties** (even those that might otherwise be mandatory under law).  
- It does not exclude **fraudulent misrepresentation** or **willful misconduct** (though some jurisdictions may not enforce disclaimers for fraud).  
- It is **absolute** in its language, leaving no room for unwritten assurances.  

### Potential Legal Considerations:  
- **Enforceability**: Some jurisdictions may limit the enforceability of such broad disclaimers, particularly concerning consumer contracts or fraud.  
- **Negotiation Point**: A party receiving goods/services under this clause may push for carve-outs (e.g., fundamental warranties or IP non-infringement).

Here’s how it addresses the request:

1. **Exclusive Warranties**  
   The clause explicitly states that the warranties listed in the agreement are the **only** warranties provided by the parties. This excludes any other warranties, whether **express, implied, or statutory**, unless expressly stated.

2. **Disclaiming Implied Warranties**  
   The clause **expressly disclaims** all implied warranties, which are typically imposed by law unless negated. Key examples mentioned include:  
   - **Merchantability** (a guarantee that goods are fit for ordinary use)  
   - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (a guarantee that goods meet a buyer’s specific needs)  

   By disclaiming these, the parties limit liability to only the warranties explicitly agreed upon in the contract.

3. **Statutory and Non-Infringement Warranties**  
   The disclaimer extends to **statutory warranties** (those imposed by law, such as under the UCC in the U.S.) and **non-infringement warranties** (unless explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement). This ensures no unintended warranties apply.

4. **Clarity (""For the Avoidance of Doubt"")**  
   The phrase reinforces the intent to exclude **all** unstated warranties, leaving no ambiguity about the scope of the disclaimer.

The clause comprehensively addresses the request by:  
- Clearly disclaiming **implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a purpose).

1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties** – The clause clearly disclaims all implied warranties, including:  
   - **Merchantability** (fitness for ordinary use)  
   - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (suitability for specific needs)

   - **Satisfactory Quality** (meeting basic performance standards)  
   - **Warranties arising from trade practices or course of dealing**  

2. **Legal Compliance** – The clause acknowledges that some jurisdictions may not permit the complete exclusion of implied warranties. Thus, it includes a **fallback limitation**:  
   - If an implied warranty cannot be excluded, its duration is restricted to the **express warranty period**.  
   - It notes that certain states/jurisdictions may not allow such limitations, preserving enforceability.  

3. **Consumer Rights Protection** – The clause clarifies that the disclaimer does not override statutory rights, ensuring compliance with mandatory consumer protection laws (e.g., UCC in the U.S., EU consumer rights).  

4. **Essential Purpose Survival** – The disclaimer remains effective even if the express warranty fails, reinforcing the broad exclusion of implied warranties.

Here’s how it aligns with the request:

1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
   The clause explicitly disclaims **""all warranties, express or implied""**, which includes common implied warranties under contract law (e.g., **merchantability** and **fitness for a particular purpose**). This addresses the core requirement of the query.

2. **Specificity**  
   It names the two most critical implied warranties recognized by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and common law:  
   - **Implied warranty of merchantability** (goods are fit for ordinary use).  
   - **Implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose** (goods meet the buyer’s special needs if the seller was aware of those needs).  

3. **Carve-Out for Express Warranties**  
   The clause preserves warranties **expressly stated in Section 12** of the agreement, ensuring the disclaimer does not override any explicit guarantees made elsewhere. This balances liability protection with contractual fairness.

4. **Broad Coverage**  
   The phrase **""concerning the subject matter of this Agreement""** ensures the disclaimer applies comprehensively to all goods/services covered by the contract.

### Relevance to the Query  
This clause is a **standard but robust disclaimer** that meets the request by:  
- Clearly negating implied warranties (key to shielding parties from unintended liabilities).  
- Complying with legal requirements (e.g., the UCC’s rules on disclaiming implied warranties).  
- Maintaining clarity and enforceability through precise language.

Here’s how it aligns with the request:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Inclusion of Implied Warranties**:  
   The clause explicitly mentions the disclaimer of **implied warranties**, which are warranties not expressly stated but assumed by law (e.g., under the Uniform Commercial Code or common law). Specifically, it disclaims:
   - **Merchantability** (implied warranty that goods are fit for ordinary use).  
   - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (implied warranty that goods/services meet a buyer’s specific needs).  

2. **Broad Disclaimer Language**:  
   The phrase *""any warranty of any kind, either express or implied""* ensures the disclaimer covers both **express** (written or verbal promises) and **implied** (automatic legal protections) warranties, unless explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement.

3. **Common Legal Safeguards**:  
   The clause follows standard contract drafting practices to limit liability by excluding warranties not expressly guaranteed. This protects both parties from unintended legal claims based on unstated expectations.

4. **Non-Infringement**:  
   While not an implied warranty, the inclusion of **non-infringement** (a warranty that goods/services do not violate third-party rights) further broadens the scope of disclaimed liabilities.

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause precisely answers the request for a warranty disclaimer that includes **implied warranties** by:  
- Naming the two primary types of implied warranties (*merchantability* and *fitness for a purpose*).  
- Using legally recognized language to ensure enforceability.  
- Clarifying that only warranties **expressly stated in the agreement** survive the disclaimer.

Here’s how it aligns with the request:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Explicit Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   The clause states that both parties disclaim **""all warranties and conditions, express, implied, or statutory""**, specifically naming common implied warranties under law:  
   - **Merchantability** (goods are fit for ordinary use).  
   - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (goods meet a buyer’s special needs).  
   - **Title/Non-Infringement** (ownership and lack of third-party claims).  

   This ensures that no unintended warranties are assumed beyond what is expressly stated in the contract.

2. **""As Is"" Provision**:  
   The materials/services are provided **""AS IS""**, reinforcing that the recipient accepts them without any guarantees, including those that might otherwise be implied by law.

3. **Reliance Clause**:  
   The language clarifies that neither party relies on any warranties or representations outside those **""specifically set forth herein""**, further negating implied obligations.

### Why This Matters:
- **Legal Protection**: The clause shields both parties from liability for claims arising from unstated expectations (e.g., ""I assumed the software would work perfectly for my needs"").  
- **Compliance with Laws**: In many jurisdictions (e.g., the UCC in the U.S.), implied warranties automatically attach to transactions unless disclaimed. This clause satisfies legal requirements for such disclaimers (e.g., using conspicuous language like ""AS IS"" and naming specific implied warranties).  
- **Risk Allocation**: It shifts the risk of defects or non-conformities to the receiving party, limiting the provider’s liability.

### Potential Considerations:
- **Jurisdictional Validity**: Some jurisdictions may limit the enforceability of disclaimers (e.g., consumer protection laws).  
- **Conspicuousness**: Courts may scrutinize whether the disclaimer is clear and prominent (which this clause achieves through capitalization and explicit terms).  

In summary, this clause comprehensively addresses the exclusion of **implied warranties** while adhering to standard contractual drafting practices. It would likely satisfy the query’s need for a legally robust disclaimer.",5

2. **Broad Disclaimer Language**:  
   - The clause uses strong, unambiguous language (""EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES"") to ensure enforceability under laws like the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) in the U.S., which governs implied warranties in commercial transactions.  
   - The inclusion of ""implied or statutory"" reinforces that no unintended warranties arise outside the agreement.  

3. **Additional Clarification (Non-Infringement Disclaimer)**:  
   - While the query focuses on merchantability and fitness, the clause goes further by also disclaiming implied warranties of **non-infringement** (unless expressly stated), which is a common addition in contracts involving intellectual property or proprietary goods/services.  

### Relevance Summary:  
The clause fully addresses the query by:  
- Clearly negating the implied warranties of **merchantability** and **fitness for a particular purpose**.  
- Using comprehensive language to prevent any unintended warranties from applying.  
- Reinforcing the disclaimer with statutory references and an avoidance-of-doubt provision.

   - By disclaiming these, the parties agree that no such legal protections apply unless explicitly promised elsewhere in the contract.

2. **Broad Coverage**  
   - The disclaimer extends to warranties that might arise from **course of dealing, performance, or industry usage**, ensuring no unintended assurances are inferred from past interactions or industry norms.  
   - It also disclaims warranties about **business outcomes or service levels**, clarifying that results are not guaranteed.

3. **Legal Compliance**  
   - This language aligns with the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-316** (for U.S. contracts), which requires clear language to disclaim implied warranties. Phrases like ""as is"" or explicit exclusions (as used here) are typical.  
   - The clause protects both parties from liability for unintended or unstated promises.

### Why This Matters for the Query

2. **Specific Mention of Key Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly calls out the two most critical implied warranties:  
     - **Merchantability**: This warranty guarantees that goods are reasonably fit for their ordinary purpose.  
     - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose**: This applies when a seller knows a buyer relies on their expertise for a specific use.  
   By naming these, the clause leaves no ambiguity about their exclusion.

   - The clause explicitly states that neither party makes any warranties beyond those ""expressly set forth"" in the agreement. This negates any unwritten or implied warranties that might otherwise arise under law (e.g., under the UCC in the U.S. or similar statutes in other jurisdictions).

2. **Specific Mention of Key Implied Warranties**

     - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose**: A guarantee that goods will meet a buyer’s specialized needs if the seller was aware of those needs.  
   - By naming these warranties, the clause ensures they are unequivocally excluded, reducing ambiguity in enforcement.

3. **Broad Coverage**  
   - The disclaimer is comprehensive, covering ""any warranty of any kind, either express or implied,"" and includes a non-exhaustive list (e.g., non-infringement) to emphasize scope. This strengthens the parties’ intent to limit liability strictly to the agreement’s express terms.

4. **Legal Enforceability**  
   - The language is clear and conspicuous (a key requirement for disclaimers under laws like the UCC), making it more likely to withstand judicial scrutiny. Phrases like ""EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH"" and capitalization of ""DISCLAIMER"" help meet notice standards.

**Why This Meets the Query’s Needs**  
The clause precisely addresses the request by:  
- Disclaiming all implied warranties, including the two specifically mentioned (merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose).  
- Using standard legal phrasing to ensure enforceability.  
- Aligning with common contract practices where parties seek to limit warranties to only those explicitly agreed upon.  

**Note**: Jurisdictions may impose additional requirements (e.g., ""conspicuous"" language or consumer protection limits), but this clause is a robust starting point for commercial agreements.",5
warranty disclaimer clause that disclaims implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,305187aaf3,"15. Disclaimers. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTION 12, THE PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.","The provided clause (Section 15) directly addresses the query by disclaiming implied warranties of **merchantability** and **fitness for a particular purpose**, which are the two key implied warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and common law. Here’s how it aligns with the request:

1. **Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims ""all warranties, express or implied,"" including the two critical implied warranties:  
     - **Merchantability**: This warranty assures that goods/services are reasonably fit for their ordinary purpose.  
     - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose**: This applies when a seller knows a buyer relies on their expertise for a specific use.  

2. **Scope and Clarity**:  
   - The disclaimer is comprehensive (""ALL WARRANTIES"") but carves out an exception for express warranties stated elsewhere (Section 12), ensuring enforceability.  
   - The phrase ""concerning the subject matter of this Agreement"" limits the disclaimer’s scope to the contract’s context.  

3. **Legal Compliance**:  
   - The language complies with the UCC’s requirement (e.g., § 2-316) that disclaimers of implied warranties must be **conspicuous** and use specific terms like ""merchantability"" (or similar) to be effective.  

**Why This Meets the Query**:  
The clause precisely disclaims the two implied warranties requested while adhering to legal standards for validity. It balances broad exclusion with a carve-out for express warranties, reducing liability risk for the disclaiming party.  

**Note**: For added robustness, some contracts include examples like ""AS IS"" language or reference state law (e.g., ""to the fullest extent permitted by law""), but this clause is already legally sufficient if properly conspicuous in the agreement.",5

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.","The clause you provided is a standard **disclaimer of warranties**, which includes a waiver of both **implied warranties of title** and **non-infringement**. Here’s how it relates to your query:

### **1. Waiver of Implied Warranty of Title**  
- The **implied warranty of title** is a legal guarantee that the seller has rightful ownership of the goods/services and can legally transfer them without claims from third parties.  
- The clause states that **no warranties are made except those expressly stated** in the agreement. Since the clause does not explicitly mention ""title,"" it effectively **disclaims any implied warranty of title**.  
- This means the buyer assumes the risk that the seller’s ownership may be disputed or invalid.

### **2. Waiver of Implied Warranty of Non-Infringement**  
- The **implied warranty of non-infringement** guarantees that goods/services do not violate third-party intellectual property rights (e.g., patents, copyrights).  
- The clause **explicitly disclaims** ""warranties of ... non-infringement"" unless expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement.  
- This means the buyer bears the risk that the goods/services may infringe on third-party IP rights, unless the agreement includes an express indemnification or warranty clause elsewhere.

### **Key Takeaways**  
- The clause **broadly disclaims all implied warranties**, including **title and non-infringement**, unless specifically stated otherwise in the contract.  
- If the buyer wants protection against title disputes or IP infringement, they should negotiate an **express warranty or indemnification clause** separately.  
- This type of disclaimer is common in commercial agreements but can significantly shift risk to the buyer.

Here’s a breakdown of its implications:

### **1. Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
The clause explicitly states that **all other warranties** (beyond what is expressly stated in the agreement) are **excluded**, whether **express or implied**. This includes:  
- **Implied warranty of title** (which guarantees that the seller has legal ownership and the right to transfer the goods/property).  
- **Implied warranty of non-infringement** (which ensures that the goods/property do not violate third-party intellectual property rights).  

By stating that **""all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded""**, the clause effectively **waives these implied warranties** unless they are explicitly preserved elsewhere in the agreement.

### **2. Specific Mention of Non-Infringement**  
The clause explicitly lists **""warranties... against infringement""** as being excluded. This means the seller/licensor is **not guaranteeing** that the product/service does not infringe on third-party IP rights (e.g., patents, copyrights, trademarks).  

### **3. ""To the Maximum Extent Permitted by Law""**  
This phrase ensures that the waiver is as broad as legally enforceable. Some jurisdictions may limit the ability to disclaim certain implied warranties (e.g., under the UCC in the U.S., waivers of the implied warranty of title may face stricter scrutiny).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **disclaims both the implied warranty of title and non-infringement**, shifting the risk of ownership disputes or IP infringement claims to the buyer/licensee. If these protections are important, the counterparty should negotiate for their explicit inclusion in the agreement.

DISTRIBUTOR'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION OR ANY CLAIM THEREOF SHALL BE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT (""PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT"").","This clause is directly relevant to the query about the **waiver of implied warranty of title and non-infringement** in the following ways:

### 1. **Waiver of Implied Warranty of Title**  
   - The clause explicitly states that **Cisco makes no representation or warranty as to ownership of intellectual property or proprietary rights**.  
   - This disclaims any implied warranty of title (i.e., the assurance that the seller has legal ownership and the right to transfer the goods/services).  
   - By including this language, Cisco ensures that the distributor cannot later claim that Cisco breached an implied warranty regarding title to the intellectual property.

### 2. **Waiver of Implied Warranty of Non-Infringement**  
   - The clause broadly disclaims **all implied warranties**, including **non-infringement**, unless expressly stated otherwise.  
   - Specifically, it states that Cisco does not warrant against **infringement or misappropriation** of third-party intellectual property rights.  
   - Instead of providing a general warranty against infringement, Cisco limits the distributor’s remedies to those outlined in **Section 15 (""Patent and Copyright Infringement"")**, which likely includes indemnification or defense obligations under specific conditions.

### 3. **General Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause follows a standard **boilerplate disclaimer** structure, rejecting all implied warranties (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, etc.) unless explicitly provided in the agreement.  
   - The phrase **""Distributor waives all representations, conditions and warranties""** reinforces that the distributor is giving up any claims based on implied warranties, including title and non-infringement.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The clause **effectively waives** any implied warranty of title by disclaiming representations about ownership of IP.  
- It **explicitly excludes** any warranty of non-infringement, shifting risk to the distributor and limiting remedies to a specific section (Section 15).  
- This aligns with common contract practices where licensors/sellers avoid broad warranties on IP ownership and infringement to limit liability.

This disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty set forth above fails of its essential purpose.","The query concerns the **waiver of implied warranty of title and non-infringement**, and the provided clause is a **broad disclaimer of implied warranties**, including non-infringement. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranty of Non-Infringement**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **""any implied warranty or condition of ... noninfringement""**, meaning Cisco (the party providing the warranty) is not guaranteeing that its products/services do not violate third-party intellectual property rights (e.g., patents, copyrights).  
   - This shifts the risk of potential IP infringement claims to the customer, unless otherwise specified in an express warranty.

2. **General Waiver of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause excludes **all implied warranties** to the extent permitted by law, including warranties of **merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and title** (though ""title"" is not explicitly mentioned, the broad language (""all express or implied conditions, representations, and warranties"") may cover it unless jurisdiction-specific laws override this).  
   - Some jurisdictions (e.g., under the UCC in the U.S.) imply a warranty of title unless disclaimed. The clause attempts a blanket exclusion but may not be fully enforceable everywhere.

3. **Limitations and Jurisdictional Variations**  
   - The clause acknowledges that some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of certain implied warranties (e.g., consumer protection laws).  
   - Where an implied warranty cannot be excluded, the clause limits its duration to the **express warranty period** (if any).  

4. **Survival Clause**  
   - The disclaimer applies even if the express warranty fails its **""essential purpose""**, reinforcing the intent to exclude implied warranties regardless of circumstances.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- If the query is about whether the contract waives the **implied warranty of title**, the clause’s broad language likely covers it, but enforceability depends on applicable law (e.g., UCC § 2-312 may require specific language to disclaim title warranties).  
- For **non-infringement**, the disclaimer is explicit and would generally shield the seller/licensor from liability unless a separate express warranty exists.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Buyers/Licensees**: May need to negotiate for an express non-infringement warranty or indemnification clause if protection against IP claims is critical.  
- **Sellers/Licensors**: The clause minimizes exposure to implied warranty claims but must ensure compliance with local laws (e.g., ""as allowed by applicable law"" caveat).

respect to such Products.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about the **""waiver of implied warranty of title and non-infringement""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Explicit Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause states that **""Seller makes no other warranty of any kind, express or implied""**, which includes a broad waiver of all implied warranties under the law (e.g., UCC Article 2 in the U.S.).  
   - Specifically, it disclaims the **implied warranty of non-infringement** by stating there is no warranty **""non-infringement of any intellectual property right of any third party.""**  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention the **implied warranty of title** (which guarantees that the seller has legal ownership and the right to transfer the goods), the phrase **""no other warranty of any kind, express or implied""** could be interpreted to include a waiver of title warranties unless otherwise required by law.  

### 2. **""As-Is"" Risk Allocation**  
   - The clause shifts all risk to the Buyer by stating that **""Buyer assumes all risk and liability whatsoever resulting from the use of such materials.""**  
   - This reinforces the waiver of implied warranties, including potential title or infringement claims, by making the Buyer solely responsible for any legal or quality issues.  

### 3. **Notice Requirement as a Condition for Claims**  
   - The clause imposes a strict **30-day notice requirement** (or longer if required by law) for the Buyer to raise any claims related to quality, damage, or other issues.  
   - Failure to notify the Seller within this period results in a **waiver of all claims**, which would likely extend to any breach of implied warranties (including title or non-infringement).  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The clause **effectively waives the implied warranty of non-infringement** by explicitly disclaiming it.  
- While the **implied warranty of title** is not directly mentioned, the broad disclaimer of all implied warranties may encompass it, depending on jurisdiction (some laws may prevent complete waiver of title warranties).  
- The **strict notice requirement** further limits the Buyer’s ability to bring claims, reinforcing the waiver.  

### **Recommendation for Clarity**  
If the Seller intends to **explicitly disclaim the implied warranty of title**, the clause should be amended to include language such as:  
*""Seller disclaims all implied warranties, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.""*

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Explicit Mention of Non-Infringement**  
   - The clause **does waive the implied warranty of non-infringement** by explicitly listing it among the disclaimed warranties.  
   - This means the clause **does not** match the query's request for a disclaimer that **does not** waive non-infringement warranties.  

2. **No Mention of Title Warranty**  
   - The clause does **not** explicitly disclaim the **warranty of title** (which ensures the seller has legal ownership and right to transfer goods).  
   - Under the **UCC (Uniform Commercial Code)**, unless explicitly disclaimed, the warranty of title may still apply by default.  

### **Conclusion:**  
- The clause **waives non-infringement warranties** (contrary to the query's requirement).  
- It **does not waive title warranties** (which aligns with the query).

Here’s the relevance:

### Key Points:
1. **Non-Infringement Disclaimer**:  
   The clause explicitly disclaims ""any and all warranties of non-infringement that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement."" This means:  
   - If the agreement includes **no express non-infringement warranty**, the disclaimer effectively waives all non-infringement warranties (implied or statutory).  
   - If the agreement **does include an express non-infringement warranty**, only that specific warranty survives; all others are disclaimed.  

2. **Title Warranty Silence**:  
   The clause does **not** mention title warranties (e.g., UCC § 2-312’s implied warranty of good title). Under contract interpretation principles:  
   - Silence on title warranties could mean they are **not disclaimed** (unless another clause addresses them or applicable law overrides).  
   - For example, the UCC’s implied warranty of title automatically applies in U.S. sales of goods **unless expressly excluded** (which this clause does not do).  

3. **Other Disclaimers**:  
   - The clause broadly disclaims **all implied/statutory warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a purpose) **except those expressly stated**.  
   - The phrase ""FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT"" reinforces that non-infringement warranties are disclaimed unless expressly included elsewhere.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- The clause **partially aligns** with the query: it **does not waive title warranties** (by omission) but **does waive non-infringement warranties** (unless expressly preserved).  
- If the goal is to **preserve non-infringement warranties**, the clause would need revision (e.g., removing the non-infringement disclaimer or adding an express non-infringement warranty).  

### Suggested Refinement (if non-infringement warranties should survive):

The provided clause (Section 10.4) is relevant because it **explicitly preserves certain intellectual property (IP) warranties while disclaiming most others**, aligning with the query's focus. Here’s the breakdown:

### **1. General Disclaimer of Warranties**  
The clause broadly disclaims most implied and statutory warranties, including:  
- **Merchantability**  
- **Fitness for a particular purpose**  
- **Non-infringement** (initially mentioned in the general disclaimer)  
- **Satisfactory quality, quiet enjoyment, accuracy, etc.**  

This aligns with standard warranty disclaimers under the **UCC (Uniform Commercial Code)** and common law, where parties often exclude implied warranties to limit liability.

### **2. Preservation of IP-Specific Warranties (Key Relevance to Query)**  
Despite the general disclaimer, the clause **carves out an exception for IP-related warranties** by stating:  
> *""NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS SECTION 10, CISCO MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, OR AS TO INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION THEREOF.""*  

This means:  
- **No waiver of title warranty**: Cisco does not guarantee ownership of IP (a ""title"" warranty under UCC § 2-312).  
- **No waiver of non-infringement warranty**: While the general disclaimer mentions non-infringement, this carve-out clarifies that Cisco **explicitly avoids making any warranties** about IP infringement.  

However, the clause then **redirects remedies for IP claims to Section 15** (Patent and Copyright Infringement), meaning:  
- The disclaimer does **not fully waive** IP-related claims but **limits remedies** to a specific contractual process.  

### **3. Why This Matches the Query**  
The query seeks a disclaimer that **does not waive title and non-infringement warranties outright**. This clause fits because:  
- It **disclaims most warranties** (including a general non-infringement statement).  
- But it **does not fully waive IP-related warranties**—instead, it **excludes them from the general disclaimer** and provides a separate remedy mechanism (Section 15).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is a **nuanced disclaimer** that:  
✔ **Broadly disclaims most warranties** (merchantability, fitness, etc.).  
✔ **Does not waive title/non-infringement warranties outright**—instead, it **explicitly avoids making such warranties** and provides a separate enforcement path.  
✔ **Limits remedies for IP claims** to a defined contractual process (Section 15).  

Thus, it aligns with the query by **not specifically waiving** title and non-infringement warranties in the traditional sense but **structurally excluding them from the general disclaimer**.",5

However, the provided clause **does explicitly disclaim** both **title** and **non-infringement warranties**, along with other implied warranties (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Explicit Disclaimer of Title & Non-Infringement** – The clause states:  
   > *""Each party disclaims all warranties... including without limitation the implied warranties of **title, non-infringement**, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose.""*  
   This means the disclaimer **does waive** these warranties, which is the **opposite** of what the query seeks.  

2. **General ""AS IS"" Disclaimer** – The clause also includes a broad **""AS IS""** provision, which typically disclaims **all implied warranties** unless exceptions are stated. Since title and non-infringement are **implied warranties**, they are still disclaimed even if not listed.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause **does not meet** the query's requirement because it **explicitly disclaims** title and non-infringement warranties. If the goal is to **preserve** these warranties, the clause should either:  
- **Omit** ""title"" and ""non-infringement"" from the list, or

Here’s how the provided clause aligns with (or deviates from) that request:

### **Key Observations:**
1. **General Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
   The clause broadly disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) **except** for any express warranties stated elsewhere in the contract. This is standard in warranty disclaimers.

2. **Non-Infringement Warranty**  
   The clause **explicitly disclaims** the implied warranty of non-infringement (""any warranty as to ... the non-infringement of any intellectual property rights of third parties""). This directly **contradicts** the query’s requirement, as it actively waives the non-infringement warranty.

3. **Title Warranty**  
   The clause does **not** mention the warranty of title (i.e., the seller’s right to transfer ownership free of liens or claims). Under the UCC (in the U.S.), unless explicitly disclaimed, the warranty of title is presumed. Since the clause is silent on title, it **does not waive it**, which aligns with the query’s requirement.

### **Relevance to the Query:**
- **Meets the Requirement:** The clause does **not** disclaim the warranty of title.  
- **Fails the Requirement:** It **does** disclaim the non-infringement warranty, which the query seeks to avoid.  

### **Suggested Revision:**
To fully align with the query, the clause should:  
1. **Remove the non-infringement disclaimer** (or clarify that non-infringement warranties are **not** disclaimed).  
2. **Explicitly preserve title warranties** (optional, but recommended for clarity).

2. **""As-Is"" Disclaimer for Non-Warranted Items**:  
   If no supplier warranty exists, the buyer accepts the product/service **""as-is""**—meaning no remedies are available. This reinforces the exclusivity of the stated remedies.  

3. **Exclusion of All Other Warranties and Liabilities**:  
   The clause explicitly disclaims all other warranties (express or implied), including merchantability, fitness for purpose, and noninfringement. It also denies liability for supplier specifications or design adequacy. This ensures the listed remedies are the **sole recourse** for the buyer, barring claims for additional damages (e.g., consequential losses).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause answers the query by:  
- Defining the **exclusive** and **limited** nature of remedies for warranty breaches.  
- Eliminating any other potential claims or warranties not expressly stated.  
- Shifting risk to the buyer for non-warranted items (""as-is"").  

This protects the seller from broader liability while providing the buyer with clear (but narrow) recourse for defective products/services.",5
exclusive remedy for breach of product warranty,99ff232523,"8.3 Remedy. ABDC’s liability and Customer’s exclusive remedy for breach of warranties in Paragraph 3.2 will be, at ABDC’s option, to (i) repair or replace Software or hardware so it performs substantially in accordance with its documentation; (ii) advise Customer how to achieve substantially the same functionality using different procedures, or (iii) replace defective media returned within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date. Such replacement will not extend such ninety (90) day period.","The clause **8.3 Remedy** directly addresses the **exclusive remedy for breach of product warranty** as follows:  

1. **Exclusive Remedy Definition** – The clause explicitly states that the listed remedies (repair, replacement, or advisory workaround) are the **only** recourse available to the Customer for a breach of warranty under **Paragraph 3.2**. This means the Customer cannot seek additional damages (e.g., monetary compensation beyond repair/replacement) unless otherwise permitted by law.  

2. **Limited Options for ABDC** – ABDC retains the **sole discretion** to choose among three remedies:  
   - **(i)** Repair or replace the non-conforming software/hardware to match its documented functionality.  
   - **(ii)** Provide guidance on alternative methods to achieve the same results.  
   - **(iii)** Replace defective media (e.g., disks, drives) if returned within **90 days** of the Effective Date.  

3. **Time-Bound Limitation** – The replacement of defective media is strictly limited to the **first 90 days**, and any replacement does **not** reset or extend this period.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
This clause is **legally binding** in defining the **exclusive remedy** for warranty breaches, ensuring that:  
- The Customer’s recovery is **restricted** to the specified corrective actions.  
- ABDC is **protected** from broader liability (e.g., consequential damages, lost profits).  
- The remedy is **time-sensitive**, particularly for media defects.

(d) Seller’s maximum liability for all claims for any reason is the invoice price of the Product(s) involved. Neither Party will be liable to the other Party in contract, tort, negligence, breach of statutory laws, or otherwise for any losses, damages, costs, or expenses of any nature whatsoever that may be incurred or suffered by or in any event could otherwise be awarded to that other Party which are of a special, incidental, punitive, consequential, indirect, or exemplary nature, including, without limitation, any economic loss or other loss of turnover, profits, business, or goodwill.
(e) The remedies set forth in this Section 7 are exclusive, and no other remedy or remedies are available to Buyer, whether in law or equity. Buyer and Seller agree that the remedies contained herein are adequate remedies.","The clause is directly relevant to the query about the **""exclusive remedy for breach of product warranty""** in the following ways:

1. **Exclusive Remedy Defined** – Subsection (e) explicitly states that the remedies provided in **Section 7** (which includes warranty-related claims) are the **only** remedies available to the Buyer. This means the Buyer cannot seek additional legal or equitable remedies beyond what is specified in the contract.  

2. **Limitation on Liability** – Subsection (d) caps the Seller’s liability at the **invoice price of the Product(s) involved**, meaning the Buyer cannot recover:  
   - **Consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption)

   - **Any other indirect losses**  

3. **Waiver of Alternative Claims** – The clause prevents the Buyer from pursuing claims under **contract law, tort (e.g., negligence), or statutory breaches** for losses beyond the agreed remedy.  

### **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
The clause ensures that the **sole and exclusive remedy** for a breach of product warranty is either:  
- A refund or credit up to the **invoice price** of the defective product, or  
- Another remedy explicitly stated in **Section 7** (e.g., repair or replacement, if mentioned elsewhere).  

The Buyer **cannot** sue for additional damages (like lost profits) even if the breach causes further harm. This is a strong limitation favoring the Seller.

   - The seller provides **only one express warranty**: that the products comply with the specifications identified in writing on the order. All other warranties (express or implied, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose) are **disclaimed**.  

2. **Exclusive Remedy for Breach**:  
   - If the products fail to meet the specifications, the buyer’s **only remedy** is for the seller to **replace the non-conforming products** with conforming ones at the seller’s expense.  
   - The clause explicitly states that this replacement is the **""sole and exclusive remedy""**, meaning the buyer cannot seek other forms of relief (e.g., monetary damages, refunds, or compensation for losses).  

3. **Exclusion of Consequential and Other Damages**:  
   - The seller **disclaims all liability** for consequential, incidental, or special damages (e.g., lost profits, lost revenue, or costs of substitute equipment). This reinforces that replacement is the **exclusive remedy**, barring any additional claims.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause ensures that the buyer’s **only recourse** for a warranty breach is **replacement of defective products**, and no other legal or financial remedies are available. This is a common risk-allocation mechanism in contracts, favoring the seller by limiting liability.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Points Relevant to ""Exclusive Remedy for Breach of Product Warranty"":
1. **Sole and Exclusive Obligation**:  
   - The clause repeatedly states that Accuray’s obligations (e.g., repair, replacement, or refund for defective Products, software, or Safety Updates) are the **exclusive remedies** available to the Customer/Distributor for warranty breaches. No other remedies (e.g., monetary damages beyond these options) are permitted unless explicitly carved out.

2. **Limitations on Liability**:  
   - The clause excludes liability for **special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or tort damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) arising from defective Products, unless mandated by law (e.g., strict product liability under applicable law).  
   - The **total aggregate liability** for breaches (including warranty claims) is capped at the purchase prices paid by the Distributor in the **12 months preceding the claim**, further limiting remedies.

3. **Specific Warranty Remedies**:  
   - For defective Products, Accuray’s exclusive remedy is to **repair, replace, or refund** (pro-rated over 5 years) at its discretion.  
   - Similar exclusive remedies apply to defective software or Safety Updates.

4. **Exceptions to Exclusive Remedy**:  
   - The exclusivity does not apply to:  
     - **Strict product liability** under mandatory law (Section 10).  
     - **Unauthorized use of intellectual property**.  
     - **Intentional breaches/willful misconduct** or non-compliance with laws.  
   - These exceptions preserve certain legal or equitable claims outside the warranty framework.

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause defines the **boundaries of the exclusive remedy** for warranty breaches:  
- The Customer/Distributor’s **only recourse** for defective Products is repair/replacement/refund—no broader damages are available.  
- The remedy is **non-negotiable** unless the breach falls under the exceptions (e.g., IP infringement, willful misconduct).  
- It aligns with commercial contracts’ typical aim to **limit liability** while complying with mandatory consumer/product liability laws.  

In summary, this clause **contractually confines** the remedies for warranty breaches to the specified actions (repair/replace/refund) and excludes other forms of compensation, unless overriding legal or intentional misconduct issues arise.",5

SELLER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR SUPPLIERS’ PRODUCT OR SERVICE SPECIFICATIONS OR THE PERFORMANCE OR ADEQUACY OF ANY DESIGN OR SPECIFICATION PROVIDED TO SELLER.","This clause directly addresses the query about **""product replacement, repair, or refund as exclusivity remedy""** by outlining the limited and exclusive remedies available to the buyer (referred to as ""You"") in case of defective products or services under the seller's warranty. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Exclusive Remedies**:  
   The clause explicitly states that the buyer’s **only remedies** (if any) are limited to:  
   - **(a) Refund** of the purchase price,  
   - **(b) Repair** of defective products/services, or  
   - **(c) Replacement/reperformance**.  
   The seller (or their suppliers) has the **sole discretion** to choose which remedy to apply.  

2. **""As-Is"" Basis for Non-Warranted Items**:  
   If no supplier warranty exists, the buyer accepts products/services **""as-is""** without any warranties, reinforcing that no other remedies (e.g., damages, further compensation) are available.  

3. **Exclusion of Other Warranties/Liability**:  
   The clause disclaims all other warranties (express or implied), including merchantability, fitness for purpose, and noninfringement. It also absolves the seller of liability for supplier specifications or design adequacy, emphasizing that the listed remedies are the **exclusive** recourse.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause confirms that the buyer’s options are strictly limited to **repair, replacement, or refund**—and nothing beyond that. It precludes claims for consequential damages, additional costs, or other legal actions, making these remedies the **sole and exclusive** resolution for defects.  

### Practical Implications:  
- The buyer cannot demand alternative remedies (e.g., compensation for losses).  
- The seller controls the choice of remedy, not the buyer.  
- No warranties apply unless explicitly stated, reinforcing the narrow scope of recourse.  

This aligns perfectly with the query’s focus on exclusivity of remedies in contractual warranties.",5
"product replacement, repair or refund as exclusivity remedy",926f3c66d7,"THE SOLE REMEDY UNDER THIS WARRANTY SHALL BE THE REPAIR,
REPLACEMENT OR CREDIT FOR DEFECTIVE PARTS AS STATED ABOVE. THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ANY
OTHER WARRANTIES EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
COMPLIANCE WITH ROHS AND WEEE (AND SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES), AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **""product replacement, repair, or refund as exclusivity remedy""** because it explicitly defines the **sole and exclusive remedies** available to the buyer under the warranty, while also disclaiming all other potential remedies or warranties. Here’s the breakdown:

### 1. **Exclusive Remedies**  
The clause states that the **only remedies** available for defective parts are:  
- **Repair** (fixing the defective part),  
- **Replacement** (providing a new part/product), or  
- **Credit** (refund or monetary compensation for the defective part).  

This means the buyer **cannot** demand additional remedies (e.g., full refund, consequential damages, or other compensation) beyond what is specified.

### 2. **Exclusion of Other Warranties**  
The clause reinforces exclusivity by stating that this warranty **replaces (""in lieu of"")** all other warranties, whether:  
- **Express** (explicitly stated elsewhere) or  
- **Implied** (automatically granted by law, such as merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or compliance with regulations like RoHS/WEEE).  

This prevents the buyer from claiming remedies based on broader legal protections unless required by mandatory law.

### 3. **Legal Implications**  
- The clause limits the seller’s liability, protecting them from broader claims.  
- If local consumer laws override such limitations (e.g., EU or U.S. consumer rights laws guaranteeing refunds in certain cases), the clause may not be fully enforceable.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The query asks whether repair, replacement, or refund is the **exclusive remedy**, and this clause confirms that:  
- These are the **only** remedies provided under the warranty.  
- No other warranties or remedies (like full refunds or damages) apply unless mandated by law.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### 1. **Exclusive Remedies for Defective/Nonconforming Products**  
   - The clause states that if the product is defective or nonconforming, the seller's obligation is limited to either:  
     - **Replacement** of the product at no additional cost, **or**  
     - **Refund** of the purchase price (at the seller's discretion) upon return of the product.  
   - Critically, it specifies that **these are the buyer's sole and exclusive remedies** for such issues, meaning the buyer cannot seek additional compensation (e.g., damages, repair costs beyond replacement/refund, or other legal remedies).  

### 2. **Limitation of Liability**  
   - The clause reinforces the exclusivity of the remedy by capping the seller’s total liability to **the purchase price of the product** in question.  
   - It explicitly excludes liability for **special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, or other indirect losses).  
   - This means the buyer cannot claim broader damages even if the defect causes additional harm.  

### 3. **Conditions for Claims**  
   - The buyer must inspect the product promptly and notify the seller of defects within **10 days** (for damage/shortages) or **150 days** (for other claims).  
   - Failure to meet these deadlines results in an unconditional waiver of claims, further limiting the buyer’s recourse.  

### 4. **Time Limit for Legal Action**  
   - Any legal action must be filed within **2 years** of the cause of action accruing, reinforcing the finality of the agreed-upon remedies.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause squarely addresses the query by:  
- Confirming that **replacement or refund** are the **only remedies** available for defective/nonconforming products.  
- Explicitly excluding all other forms of relief (e.g., repairs, monetary damages beyond the purchase price).  
- Emphasizing the **exclusivity** of these remedies through clear language (""sole and exclusive remedy"") and liability limitations.  

Thus, the buyer cannot demand repairs, alternative compensation, or broader damages—only replacement or refund, as determined by the seller. This is a strong limitation of remedies in the seller’s favor.",5

Here’s how it applies:

### **1. Exclusive Remedies (Subsection (e))**  
- The clause states that the **only remedies** available to the Buyer are those specified in **Section 7** (which presumably includes repair, replacement, or refund).  
- No other remedies—whether **legal, equitable, or statutory**—are available beyond what is contractually agreed.  
- The parties have **expressly agreed** that these remedies are **adequate**, meaning the Buyer cannot seek additional compensation (e.g., consequential damages, lost profits, etc.).

  - **Indirect or exemplary damages** (e.g., reputational harm)  
- This reinforces that the Buyer’s **sole recourse** is repair, replacement, or refund—**not monetary compensation beyond the product’s cost**.  

### **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
- If the product is defective, the Buyer’s **only options** are those explicitly stated in the contract (likely repair, replacement, or refund).  
- The Buyer **cannot sue** for additional losses (e.g., lost sales due to a faulty product).  
- The clause **protects the Seller** from excessive liability while ensuring the Buyer has a **defined, limited remedy**.

### 1. **Exclusive Remedies for Non-Conforming Products**  
The clause specifies that if the Products do not comply with the warranties (e.g., defects, non-conformity to Specifications), the Customer’s **sole and exclusive remedies** are limited to:  
   - **Repair or Replacement** (either by Philips or the Customer in the field, or by returning to Philips).  
   - **Refund** (full purchase price for non-conforming Products).  

This means the Customer cannot seek additional remedies (e.g., damages, termination) unless explicitly allowed elsewhere in the Agreement or by law.  

### 2. **Conditions for Exercising Remedies**  
   - The Customer must **consult Philips** first to determine the most appropriate remedy.  
   - The election of remedy (repair, replacement, or refund) must be **reasonable**, implying it should align with the nature of the defect.  

### 3. **Warranty Coverage for Repaired/Replaced Products**  
   - If Philips repairs or replaces the Products, the warranty for those items extends only for the **remaining original Warranty Term** (not a new full term).  

### 4. **Scope of Warranties**  
The clause reinforces the basis for these remedies by detailing the warranties (e.g., conformity to Specifications, fitness for purpose, compliance with laws), which, if breached, trigger the right to repair/replacement/refund.  

### 5. **Exclusivity & Limitations**  
   - The phrase *""Without prejudice to any other rights accruing under this Agreement or law""* suggests that statutory rights (e.g., consumer protection laws) may override this exclusivity if applicable.  
   - However, under the contractual terms, the remedies are intentionally limited to repair, replacement, or refund.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause explicitly defines repair, replacement, and refund as the **exclusive contractual remedies** for warranty breaches, aligning with the query’s focus. It also clarifies the process (consultation, reasonableness) and limitations (warranty duration for repaired items).

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Shelf Life Warranty (Subsection b)**:  
   - The clause guarantees that the products will have a **remaining shelf life of at least 12 months** at the time of shipment. This ensures the customer receives products with sufficient usability time, which is critical for perishable or time-sensitive goods.  
   - If the product’s shelf life is shorter than promised, it constitutes a breach of warranty.

   - The Company guarantees that, at the time of shipment, the Products will have a **remaining shelf life of at least 12 months**. This assures the Customer that the Products will remain usable/salable for the specified period under normal conditions.  
   - This is a critical protection for the Customer, especially in industries where shelf life impacts product safety, efficacy, or marketability (e.g., food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics).

2. **Quality and Merchantability (Subsection a)**:  
   - The Products must be of **commercially salable quality** and **merchantable** (fit for ordinary use). This indirectly ties to shelf life, as degraded or near-expiry products may not meet this standard.

3. **Compliance with Laws**:  
   - The Company warrants that the Products are manufactured, labeled, stored, and shipped in compliance with **applicable laws**, which often include shelf-life labeling or stability requirements (e.g., FDA regulations for perishable goods).

4. **Remedy for Breach**:  
   - If the Products fail to meet the shelf-life warranty (or other standards), the Customer’s **exclusive remedy** is replacement of the non-conforming Products. The Company is not liable for further damages (e.g., lost profits or downstream costs).

5. **Limitation of Liability**:  
   - The clause excludes liability for **incidental or consequential damages**, emphasizing that the warranty is limited to replacement only, not broader losses.

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause ensures the Customer receives Products with a **minimum 12-month remaining shelf life** at shipment and provides a clear (but limited) recourse if this warranty is breached. It balances protection for the Customer with risk allocation favoring the Company.

If the Supplier provides no warranty, the customer accepts the product/service **""as-is""** with **no guarantees** of quality or performance. This severely limits the customer’s rights if defects arise.

### 3. **Disclaimer of All Other Warranties**  
The Seller explicitly disclaims:  
   - **Implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose),  
   - **Representations** about product condition or performance,  
   - **Non-infringement** guarantees.  

   This means the customer has **no legal grounds** to claim the product should have met unstated expectations unless explicitly promised in the contract.

### 4. **Seller’s Liability Limitation**  
The Seller denies responsibility for:  
   - Supplier specifications or designs,  
   - Whether the product/service meets the customer’s needs.  

   Even if a defect stems from the Supplier’s actions, the Seller’s liability is restricted to the remedies in (a)–(c) above.

### **Practical Relevance to the Query**  
- The customer’s rights are **narrowly defined** and exclude common legal protections (e.g., implied warranties).  
- The Seller has **sole discretion** to choose the remedy (refund/repair/replacement), leaving the customer with little bargaining power.  
- If the product is sold without a Supplier warranty, the customer assumes **all risk** for defects.  

**Key Takeaway:** The clause heavily favors the Seller by limiting remedies and disclaiming most warranties. Customers should carefully evaluate whether these terms are acceptable, especially for high-value or critical purchases. In some jurisdictions, mandatory consumer protection laws may override such disclaimers.",5
customer's right for defective products,56fe33f38d,"Customer may reject any Non-Complying Product or Product that is not delivered to Customer in accordance with this Agreement by providing written notice of such rejection to Manufacturer within seventy-five (75) days following Customer's receipt of any Delivery of Product hereunder; provided, however, that Customer may, until the expiry date for a Product, provide notice of rejection of any Delivery of such Product having (i) latent defects, (ii) any defects that are not reasonably discoverable by Customer through standard inspection and testing of Products or (iii) defects caused by the breach by Manufacturer of any of its representations or warranties under this Agreement (collectively, ""Latent Defects""); provided, further, that, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall notify Manufacturer within sixty (60) days after Customer first becomes aware of any such Latent Defect.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Points Addressing the Query:
1. **Right to Reject Defective Products**:  
   - The customer may reject products that are **non-complying** (do not meet agreed standards) or **not delivered as per the agreement**.  
   - For **standard defects** (discoverable through inspection), the customer must notify the manufacturer **within 75 days of receipt**.  

2. **Special Provisions for Latent Defects**:  
   - The customer has extended rights to reject products with **latent defects** (defects not discoverable through standard inspection) until the product’s expiry date.  
   - Latent defects include:  
     - Hidden flaws (e.g., internal manufacturing defects).  
     - Defects caused by the manufacturer’s breach of warranties.  
   - However, once the customer becomes aware of a latent defect, they must notify the manufacturer **within 60 days**.  

3. **Manufacturer’s Right to Contest Rejection**:  
   - The manufacturer may dispute the rejection by:  
     - Providing 60 days’ advance notice.  
     - Meeting with the customer to discuss the issue.  
     - Formally rejecting the claim if unresolved.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- **Clarity on Deadlines**: The clause specifies strict timelines (75 days for standard defects, expiry date for latent defects, and 60 days post-discovery for notification).  
- **Types of Defects Covered**: It distinguishes between obvious defects (requiring prompt action) and latent defects (allowing longer recourse).  
- **Balanced Protections**: While the customer has rejection rights, the manufacturer can challenge unjustified claims, ensuring fairness.  

### Practical Implications for the Customer:  
- **Prompt Inspection**: The customer must inspect products upon delivery to identify obvious defects within 75 days.  
- **Documentation**: Written notice is required for all rejections, including latent defects.  
- **Awareness Triggers**: The 60-day clock for latent defects starts when the customer *first becomes aware* of the issue, emphasizing the need for vigilance.  

In summary, this clause defines the customer’s rights and procedural requirements for addressing defective products, ensuring both parties have clear remedies and safeguards.",5

Here’s how it directly addresses the query about a customer's rights for defective products:

### **1. Customer's Remedies for Defective Products**  
- **Repair, Replacement, or Refund**: If a customer notifies Accuray of a defect during the warranty period, Accuray must either:  
  - Repair or replace the defective product, **or**  
  - Refund a **pro-rated portion** of the purchase price (based on a 5-year straight-line depreciation) if repair/replacement is not commercially reasonable.  

- **Exclusive Remedy**: This is stated as the **sole and exclusive remedy** for defective products, meaning the customer cannot seek additional compensation beyond these options unless exceptions apply (e.g., strict product liability under mandatory law).  

### **2. Limitations on Liability**  
- **No Consequential/Punitive Damages**: The clause explicitly excludes liability for **special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, or data loss), unless:  
  - There is **intentional misconduct**,  
  - A breach involves **unauthorized use of intellectual property**, or  
  - **Mandatory law** (e.g., strict product liability) requires otherwise.  

- **Monetary Cap on Liability**: The total liability for breaches (excluding IP violations, willful misconduct, or legal non-compliance) is **capped at the purchase price paid in the 12 months before the claim**.  

### **3. Exceptions Where Liability May Still Apply**  
- **Strict Product Liability**: If local law imposes **strict liability** (e.g., for safety defects), the clause does not override such rights.  
- **Willful Misconduct or IP Breaches**: Liability is not limited for intentional wrongdoing or unauthorized IP use.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
This clause defines:  
- **What the customer is entitled to** (repair, replacement, or refund).  
- **What they cannot claim** (indirect damages like lost profits).  
- **When broader liability may still apply** (e.g., under mandatory consumer protection laws).  

Thus, while the customer has a **clear remedy for defects**, their rights are **limited by the contract’s liability exclusions**, unless overriding laws or specific misconduct apply.

customer's right for defective products,53fc343ad4,"The Customer shall inspect all Products promptly upon receipt thereof and may reject any defective Product, provided that the Customer shall within seven (7) days after receipt of such alleged defective Product, notify the Manufacturer of its rejection and either: (i) request to destroy in field for credit of the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs (with approval), or (ii) request a Return Material Authorization (""RMA"") number and within seven (7) days of receipt of the RMA number from the Manufacturer return such rejected Product to the Manufacturer.","This clause is directly relevant to the **customer's rights for defective products** as it outlines the specific steps and timelines the customer must follow to exercise their rights when receiving a defective product. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Right to Inspect and Reject Defective Products**:  
   - The clause grants the customer the right to inspect products upon receipt and reject any that are defective. This ensures the customer is not obligated to accept faulty goods.

2. **Notification Requirement**:  
   - The customer must notify the manufacturer of the defect **within 7 days of receipt**. This sets a clear deadline for raising complaints, protecting both parties by ensuring timely resolution.

3. **Remedies for Defective Products**:  
   The customer has two options upon rejection:  
   - **(i) Destruction for Credit**: Request permission to destroy the defective product (e.g., for cost or logistical reasons) and receive a credit for its value and associated shipping costs.  
   - **(ii) Return for Replacement/Refund**: Obtain an RMA number and return the product within 7 days of receiving the RMA. This ensures the manufacturer can verify the defect and process a refund, replacement, or other resolution.

4. **Time-Bound Actions**:  
   - The 7-day deadlines (for notification and return) create certainty, preventing indefinite delays in resolving disputes over defective goods.

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause defines the customer’s rights (inspection, rejection, and remedies) while imposing reasonable procedural requirements to protect the manufacturer from frivolous or delayed claims. It balances the customer’s entitlement to defect-free products with the manufacturer’s need for prompt notice and evidence of defects.

seller-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses,487cf8c0ea,"Disclaimer. THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE THE PARTIES' ONLY WARRANTIES AND NO OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WILL APPLY. EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","This clause is highly **seller-favorable** in its warranty disclaimer for several key reasons, directly addressing the query by limiting the seller's liability and maximizing contractual protections:

### 1. **Exclusive Warranties**  
   - The clause states that **only the warranties explicitly listed in the agreement** apply. This narrows the seller’s obligations to precisely defined terms, preventing buyers from claiming protections beyond what was negotiated.  

### 2. **Broad Disclaimer of Implied/Statutory Warranties**  
   - The seller **expressly disclaims all implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose), which are otherwise automatically imposed by law (e.g., UCC § 2-314/315 in the U.S.). This shields the seller from claims based on unstated expectations.  

### 3. **Targeted Exclusion of Non-Infringement**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **any non-infringement warranties** unless expressly included elsewhere in the agreement. This is critical for sellers (e.g., software/tech vendors) to avoid liability for third-party IP claims unless specifically warranted.  

### 4. **Mutual Language as a Smokescreen**  
   - While framed as applying to ""each party,"" this is often a **drafting tactic** to make the clause appear balanced. In practice, sellers benefit disproportionately because buyers typically rely more on implied warranties (e.g., product functionality).  

### 5. **""For the Avoidance of Doubt"" Reinforcement**  
   - This phrase underscores the intent to **eliminate ambiguity**, ensuring courts interpret the disclaimer strictly against the buyer. It preempts arguments that implied warranties might still apply.  

### **Why This is Seller-Favorable**  
- **Risk Shift**: The buyer bears the risk for defects or performance issues not covered by the limited express warranties.  
- **Litigation Defense**: The clause creates a strong barrier to claims based on common-law or statutory warranties.  
- **Control Over Liability**: By disclaiming non-infringement, the seller avoids open-ended exposure to third-party claims.  

**Drafting Note**: In jurisdictions with strict consumer protection laws (e.g., EU, some U.S. states), such broad disclaimers may be partially unenforceable. However, in B2B contracts, this language is often upheld.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:  

1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties** – The clause disclaims **all implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) unless expressly stated otherwise in the agreement. This protects the seller from claims based on unwritten expectations.  

2. **Exclusion of Industry or Performance-Based Warranties** – It explicitly rejects any warranties arising from **course of dealing, course of performance, or industry usage**, preventing the buyer from arguing that past dealings or industry norms create enforceable guarantees.  

3. **Neutral Language (But Still Seller-Favorable)** – While phrased as applying to ""neither party,"" in many transactions (e.g., sales of goods/services), the seller is the party more likely to face warranty claims. Thus, this clause primarily benefits the seller by narrowing potential liability.  

4. **Limitation on Business Outcomes** – The disclaimer explicitly states that no warranty is given regarding **business results or service levels**, shielding the seller from claims that the product/service failed to meet the buyer’s broader expectations.  

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:  
- Shifts risk to the buyer by disclaiming implied protections.  
- Prevents ""gap-filling"" by courts using common law or UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) implied warranties.  
- Reduces exposure to litigation over unintended assurances.  

For a **stronger seller-favorable stance**, the clause could be made even more one-sided (e.g., explicitly stating that the seller disclaims all warranties while the buyer may still provide some). However, as written, it remains protective of the seller’s interests.

1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties** – The clause states that **no representations or warranties** are made beyond what is expressly written in the agreement. This protects the seller from claims based on unwritten promises or expectations.  

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties** – The clause explicitly disclaims **implied warranties**, including:

   - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (that goods will meet a buyer’s special needs)  
   - **Non-Infringement** (that goods do not violate third-party rights)  
   This shifts risk to the buyer, as they cannot rely on these common legal protections.  

3. **""As-Is"" Effect** – By disclaiming implied warranties, the clause effectively treats the sale as **""as-is,""** meaning the buyer assumes all risks regarding quality and performance.  

4. **Neutral Language (But Still Seller-Favorable)** – While phrased as applying to ""neither party,"" in practice, this type of clause is often more beneficial to the **seller**, who is typically the party making warranties about goods/services. Buyers usually have fewer warranties to disclaim.  

### Why This is Seller-Favorable:  
- Reduces the seller’s legal exposure by eliminating warranty claims not explicitly agreed to.  
- Prevents buyers from arguing that implied warranties apply.  
- Encourages buyers to negotiate specific warranties if they want protections, rather than relying on default legal guarantees.  

For even stronger seller protection, some agreements may:  
- Specify that disclaimers apply **""to the fullest extent permitted by law.""**

Here’s why it benefits the seller:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Broad Waiver of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement), which are typically imposed by law unless explicitly waived. This protects the seller from claims based on unwritten expectations.

2. **No Guarantees on Performance or Results**  
   - The seller explicitly disclaims any responsibility for:  
     - **Sales revenues** (no promise of minimum sales).  
     - **Economic benefits** (buyer assumes risk of participation).  
   This shields the seller from disputes if the buyer’s expectations aren’t met.

3. **Mutual Disclaimer (But Often Seller-Beneficial)**  
   While framed as applying to ""both parties,"" such clauses often disproportionately favor the seller, especially in transactions where the buyer relies on the seller’s product/service quality (e.g., software, goods). The buyer assumes most risks beyond explicit contractual promises.

4. **Carve-Out for Limited Representations**  
   - The only surviving warranties are those in **Section 7.1**, which are likely narrow and carefully drafted by the seller to minimize exposure.

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:
- Reduces the seller’s legal exposure post-transaction.  
- Forces the buyer to rely solely on the express terms of the contract, not broader legal protections.  
- Common in ""as-is"" sales or high-risk industries (e.g., tech, manufacturing).  

**Drafting Note:** For maximum seller protection, ensure Section 7.1’s representations are precise and exclude open-ended promises. Buyers should push for narrower disclaimers or specific survival periods for key warranties.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTION 12, THE PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.","This clause is a **seller-favorable warranty disclaimer** because it limits the seller's liability by disclaiming most warranties, except those explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement (in this case, Section 12). Here’s why it aligns with the query:  

1. **Broad Disclaimer of Implied Warranties** – The clause explicitly disclaims all implied warranties, including the **implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose**, which are otherwise automatically imposed by law (e.g., under the UCC in the U.S.). This shifts risk to the buyer.  

2. **Narrow Exception** – The only warranties that apply are those **expressly stated in Section 12**, meaning the seller avoids unintended legal exposure beyond what they specifically guarantee.  

3. **Clear and Conspicuous Language** – The disclaimer is written in **all-caps**, which may help satisfy legal requirements for prominence (depending on jurisdiction), making it harder for a buyer to later claim they didn’t notice it.  

### **Why This Benefits the Seller**  
- Reduces the risk of breach-of-warranty claims.  
- Limits remedies available to the buyer if the product/service fails.  
- Ensures the seller’s obligations are strictly confined to the express terms they define (Section 12), rather than open-ended legal defaults.

### **Why This is Buyer-Favorable:**  
1. **Narrowly Defined Warranties** – The buyer is protected from vague or overly broad warranties, ensuring that only the agreed-upon warranties apply.  
2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties** – By disclaiming implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for purpose), the buyer avoids potential disputes over unwritten expectations.  
3. **Clear Disclaimer of Non-Infringement** – Unless explicitly stated, the seller does not guarantee that the product/service won’t infringe third-party rights, reducing the buyer’s risk of unexpected IP claims.  
4. **Reciprocal Language (""Each Party"")** – While this clause applies to both parties, in a buyer-favorable context, it ensures the seller cannot later impose additional implied obligations on the buyer.  

### **Potential Buyer Benefits:**  
- **Reduced Liability** – The buyer is not bound by warranties beyond what is explicitly agreed.  
- **Contractual Certainty** – Only the written warranties apply, minimizing ambiguity.  
- **Avoiding Overreach** – Prevents the seller from later claiming that unstated warranties were intended.

Here’s how:  

### **1. Mutual Disclaimer (Balanced but Buyer-Protective)**  
- The clause disclaims warranties for **both parties**, which may seem neutral, but in practice, it benefits the buyer by:  
  - Preventing the seller from making broad claims about product/service performance (e.g., ""This software will increase your revenue by 50%"").  
  - Shifting risk to the seller if the buyer relies on such claims, as the buyer can point to this clause to argue no such warranties were made.  

### **2. Broad Waiver of Implied Warranties (Buyer Protection Against Overreach)**  
- The clause explicitly disclaims **implied warranties** (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement), which are often relied upon in disputes.  
  - A buyer may prefer this because it **limits future liability**—if the product fails, the seller cannot argue the buyer assumed implied warranties.  
  - However, if the buyer is the **weaker party** (e.g., a small business purchasing from a large supplier), they may want to negotiate carve-outs for critical warranties.  

### **3. Specific Disclaimers on Revenue & Economic Benefit (Buyer Safeguard)**  
- The seller **cannot guarantee business outcomes** (e.g., ""This marketing service will double your sales"").  
  - This protects the buyer from **overpromising sellers** and ensures they rely only on **explicit contractual promises** (e.g., payment terms, delivery obligations).  
  - If the seller later claims the buyer should have expected certain results, the buyer can point to this clause to refute liability.  

### **4. Exception for Express Representations (Buyer’s Fallback Protection)**  
- The clause **preserves warranties in Section 7.1** (likely where the seller makes specific promises).  
  - A buyer-friendly approach ensures that **only defined, negotiated warranties apply**, reducing ambiguity.  

### **Why This is Buyer-Favorable Overall**  
- **Reduces seller’s ability to avoid liability for vague promises.**  
- **Forces reliance on documented warranties (Section 7.1), not verbal assurances.**  
- **Prevents disputes over ""expected benefits"" that are not contractually guaranteed.**  

### **Potential Buyer Negotiation Points**  
If the buyer wants **even stronger protection**, they could:  
- Push for **narrower disclaimers** (e.g., keeping implied warranties for merchantability).  
- Ensure **Section 7.1 (Representations)** includes robust seller commitments.  
- Add a **survival clause** ensuring warranties last beyond contract termination.  

**Conclusion:** This clause is buyer-favorable because it **limits warranties to only what is explicitly stated**, preventing sellers from making unenforceable claims. However, buyers should still ensure their core protections are in **Section 7.1** to avoid over-disclaiming.",5

However, its relevance to the query lies in how it **limits warranties**—which may be adjusted to be more buyer-friendly with modifications. Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **General Disclaimer**:  
   - Neither party provides warranties beyond what is **expressly stated** in the agreement. This shifts risk to the buyer, as they cannot rely on unwritten assurances.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**:  
   - Explicitly disclaims **implied warranties of merchantability** and **fitness for a particular purpose** (common under the UCC in the U.S.). This weakens buyer protections by removing default legal guarantees.

3. **No Guarantee of Results**:  
   - Rejects warranties about **business outcomes or service levels**, which could leave the buyer unprotected if deliverables fail to meet expectations.

4. **Course of Conduct Exclusion**:  
   - Disclaims warranties arising from **past dealings, industry norms, or performance patterns**, further narrowing the buyer’s recourse.

### Why This is *Not* Buyer-Favorable:
- The clause **maximizes the seller’s protection** by eliminating most warranties, forcing the buyer to rely solely on **express terms** negotiated in the contract.  
- Buyers typically prefer **retaining implied warranties** or **specific performance guarantees** to ensure quality and usability.

### How to Make It Buyer-Favorable:
To align with buyer interests, the clause could be revised to:  
- **Preserve implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability/fitness).  
- **Include carve-outs** for known defects or service levels.  
- **Add survival periods** for certain warranties post-delivery.  
- **Require seller certifications** (e.g., compliance with specs).  

### Relevance to the Query:
The clause illustrates a **baseline disclaimer** that buyers may seek to **limit or modify** to secure stronger protections. A buyer-favorable version would **narrow the disclaimer’s scope** or **shift liability back to the seller** for key issues.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.","The clause you provided is a **standard warranty disclaimer** that limits the warranties given by both parties in the agreement. However, from a **buyer-favorable** perspective, this clause may be seen as **unfavorable** because it broadly disclaims all implied warranties (such as merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement) unless explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement.  

### **Relevance to ""Buyer-Favorable Warranty Disclaimer Clauses""**  
1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties** – The clause eliminates most implied warranties, which could leave the buyer with little recourse if the product/service fails to meet basic expectations. A buyer-favorable version would typically carve out more protections or limit the scope of the disclaimer.  

2. **No Special Buyer Protections** – A truly buyer-favorable clause might:  
   - Allow some implied warranties (e.g., merchantability) to survive.  
   - Include exceptions for known defects or seller misconduct.  
   - Require the seller to provide minimum performance guarantees.  

3. **Symmetrical Treatment** – The clause applies equally to both parties, which is neutral rather than buyer-favorable. A buyer-favorable version might impose stricter disclaimers on the seller while preserving more rights for the buyer.  

### **Suggested Buyer-Favorable Adjustments**  
If the buyer wants a more protective stance, the clause could be revised to:  
- **Narrow the disclaimer** (e.g., only disclaim implied warranties to the extent permitted by law).  
- **Exclude certain warranties** (e.g., ""except where prohibited by law, Seller disclaims all implied warranties"").  
- **Add carve-outs** (e.g., ""Seller remains liable for defects known and not disclosed at the time of sale"").  

### **Conclusion**  
The current clause is **not buyer-favorable**—it is a standard, balanced disclaimer that heavily restricts warranties. A buyer seeking stronger protections would need to negotiate exceptions or weaken the disclaimer’s scope.

RESELLER SHALL MAKE NO REPRESENTATION, GUARANTEE, OR WARRANTY CONCERNING THE COMPANY PRODUCT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED IN ADVANCE BY COMPANY IN WRITING. TO THE EXTENT THE RESELLER HAS COMPLIED WITH THE OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE COMPANY SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE RESELLER FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE RESELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES (WHETHER DIRECTLY OR IN CONNECTION WITH A CLAIM BY A THIRD PARTY) AS A RESULT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY PRODUCTS.

Instead, it primarily protects the **Company** and the **Reseller**, not the buyer. Here’s why it does not favor the buyer and how it relates to the query:

### Key Points Against Buyer-Favorability:
1. **No Buyer Protections** – The clause focuses on the relationship between the **Company** and the **Reseller**, not the buyer. It does not provide any warranties or assurances to the buyer regarding product quality, fitness for purpose, or merchantability.  

2. **Strict Warranty Disclaimer** – The Reseller is prohibited from making any representations or warranties about the product **unless explicitly authorized by the Company in writing**. This means the buyer has no recourse against the Reseller for product defects unless the Company has approved such warranties.  

3. **Indemnification Flows One Way (Mostly)** –  
   - The **Company indemnifies the Reseller** for losses related to the product (protecting the Reseller from liability).  
   - The **Reseller indemnifies the Company** for losses caused by the Reseller’s activities (protecting the Company).  
   - **No indemnification is provided to the buyer**—they are left without protection if the product fails or causes harm.  

4. **No Implied Warranties** – The clause does not preserve any implied warranties (e.g., merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose under the UCC), which are typically buyer-friendly.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The query asks for **buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses**, but this clause is **seller/reseller-favorable** because:  
- It **disclaims all warranties** unless explicitly approved by the Company.  
- It **shifts liability away from the seller/reseller** and does not extend protections to the buyer.  
- It **focuses on indemnification between the Company and Reseller**, not the buyer.  

### Buyer-Favorable Alternative:  
A truly buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer would:  
- Limit (rather than broadly disclaim) warranties.  
- Preserve implied warranties where applicable.  
- Provide recourse for defective products.  
- Include buyer indemnification or remedies.  

This clause does the opposite, making it **unfavorable to buyers**.

(2) Notwithstanding Subsection 11(a) (1), the indemnification in Subsection 11(a)(1) does not and shall not apply to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment that has become non- appealable shall determine that (a) the Agents and their respective affiliates have been negligent or have committed any fraudulent or illegal act in the course of the professional services rendered to the Corporation, and (b) such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions were caused or incurred by the gross negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of the Agents. (3) If any matter or thing contemplated by this Section 11 shall be asserted against any Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such Indemnified Party will notify the Corporation in writing as soon as possible of the nature of such claim (provided that omission to so notify the Corporation will not relieve the Corporation of any liability that it may otherwise have to the Indemnified Party hereunder, except to the extent the Corporation is materially prejudiced by such omission) and the Corporation shall be entitled (but not required) to assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such claim; provided, however, that the defence shall be through legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and that no settlement may be made by the Corporation or such Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
(4) In any such claim, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain other legal counsel to act on such Indemnified Party's behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such other legal counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party, unless: (a) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Corporation; or (b) the Corporation has not assumed the defence and employed counsel thereof promptly after receiving notice of such claim; or (c) the named parties to any such claim include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation, and the Indemnified Party has been advised by legal counsel thereto that representation of both the Corporation and the Indemnified Party by the same legal counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them; or (d) there are one or more defences available to the Indemnified Party which are different from and in addition to those available to the Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties.

(d) Retaining Counsel In any such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain one separate counsel to act on his or its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of the other counsel; (ii) the named parties to any such Claim (including any added third or impleaded party) include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel to the Indemnified Party that the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Corporation and the Indemnified Party; or (iii) the Corporation shall not have retained counsel within seven Business Days following receipt by the Corporation of notice of any such Claim from the Indemnified Party; provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties.","This **indemnity or indemnification clause** is highly relevant to your query as it comprehensively outlines the rights, obligations, and limitations related to indemnification in a contractual agreement (here, an underwriting agreement). Below is a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification**  
The clause specifies that the **Corporation** agrees to indemnify the **Agents** and their affiliates (the ""Indemnified Parties"") against:  
- **Expenses, losses, claims, damages, or liabilities** arising from professional services rendered to the Corporation.  
- **Specific triggers** for indemnification, such as:  
  - Misrepresentations or omissions in the Agreement, public filings (e.g., SEDAR), or marketing materials.  
  - Regulatory actions (e.g., securities investigations) due to misstatements or non-compliance.  
  - Breaches of the Corporation’s representations, warranties, or obligations.  

### **2. Exclusions from Indemnity**  
The indemnity **does not apply** if:  
- A court determines that the **Agents acted negligently, fraudulently, or with wilful misconduct**.  
- The Agents were provided corrected documents but failed to disclose them, leading to a claim.  

### **3. Procedural Requirements**  
- **Notice of Claims**: The Indemnified Party must notify the Corporation promptly (though failure to do so only prejudices the Corporation if materially harmed).  
- **Defense Control**: The Corporation may assume the defense (with counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Party) but cannot settle without consent.  
- **Separate Counsel**: The Indemnified Party may retain independent counsel at their own expense, unless:  
  - The Corporation approves it.  
  - A conflict of interest exists.  
  - The Corporation fails to act promptly.  

### **4. Additional Protections**  
- **Trust Mechanism**: The Agents hold indemnity rights in trust for non-party affiliates (e.g., directors, employees).  
- **Jurisdiction Consent**: The Corporation submits to jurisdiction for claims but retains the right to challenge forum.  
- **Settlement Restrictions**: No liability for settlements made without the Corporation’s consent.  

### **Why This Matters for Your Query**  
This clause is a **robust example of an indemnification provision** in a commercial contract, particularly in securities/financial transactions. It:  
- Defines **who is protected** (Indemnified Parties).  
- Lists **covered risks** (misrepresentations, regulatory actions, breaches).  
- Sets **limits on indemnity** (exclusions for misconduct).  
- Establishes **procedural safeguards** (notice, defense control, counsel rights).

Here’s how it aligns with your request:  

### **Key Aspects of the Clause Relevant to Indemnity/Indemnification:**  
1. **Scope of Indemnity**:  
   - The Indemnitor agrees to **defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the Indemnitee against losses arising from:  
     - Breach of contractual obligations (e.g., warranties, representations).  
     - Negligence or fault causing personal injury/property damage.  
     - Intellectual property infringement claims (e.g., patents, copyrights).  

2. **Covered Liabilities**:  
   - Explicitly includes **legal fees, damages, claims, and other expenses** tied to third-party actions (lawsuits, demands, etc.).  

3. **Parties Protected**:  
   - Extends protection beyond the contracting parties to their **affiliates, employees, and agents**.

Here’s how it aligns with the concept of mutual indemnification:

### Key Features of Mutual Indemnification in the Clause:
1. **Reciprocal Obligations**:  
   - Both parties (referred to as ""Indemnifying Party"" and ""Indemnified Party"" interchangeably) agree to indemnify and defend each other. This mutual structure ensures neither party bears unilateral liability for covered claims.

2. **Scope of Coverage**:  
   - The clause covers claims arising from **negligent acts/omissions** of the Indemnifying Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees, as well as **breaches of the agreement**.  
   - It explicitly excludes liability for **sole negligence** of the Indemnified Party (or its affiliates), ensuring fairness.

3. **Procedural Safeguards**:  
   - **Notice Requirement**: The Indemnified Party must promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of claims to trigger defense/indemnification rights.  
   - **Defense Control**: The Indemnifying Party has the right to settle/defend claims (with counsel of their choice), but the Indemnified Party may step in if the Indemnifying Party fails to act.  
   - **Participation Rights**: The Indemnified Party retains the right to participate in the defense, ensuring transparency.

4. **Successors and Assigns**:  
   - The obligations bind successors/assigns, ensuring continuity of indemnification rights beyond the original parties.

- Allocating risk **proportionally** (e.g., excluding sole negligence).  
- Providing **clear procedures** for claims handling.  
- Ensuring both parties share responsibility for losses tied to their actions or breaches.

The Parties shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other, their heirs, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, expenses, causes of action, suits, claims, and judgments of any kind or character for injury to person or property arising in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT, whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise.","The **mutual indemnification provision** in Clause 25 is directly responsive to your query because it establishes a **reciprocal obligation** between the parties to protect each other from certain legal and financial risks arising from the agreement. Here’s how it aligns with your request:

### Key Aspects of Mutual Indemnification in the Clause:
1. **Reciprocal Protection**  
   - Both parties agree to **indemnify, hold harmless, and defend** each other (and their successors/assigns). This mutual obligation ensures neither party bears undue liability for covered claims.

2. **Scope of Covered Claims**  
   - The clause applies to **""any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, expenses, [etc.]""** arising from the agreement.  
   - It covers claims tied to **injury to person or property**, whether due to **negligence or other causes**, as long as they relate to the parties’ responsibilities under the agreement.

3. **Broad Coverage for Fault**  
   - The phrase **""whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise""** ensures indemnification applies even if the indemnifying party is at fault (unless prohibited by law). This is a strong mutual protection feature.

4. **Survival & Binding Effect**  
   - The clause extends to **""heirs, successors, and assigns""**, ensuring obligations persist beyond the original parties.

### Relevance to Your Query:  
- **Mutuality**: The clause is explicitly mutual—both parties have equal indemnification duties.  
- **Risk Allocation**: It balances risk by ensuring neither party is solely responsible for third-party claims or losses tied to the agreement.  
- **Legal Safeguard**: Addresses common concerns in contracts (e.g., negligence claims, litigation costs) while maintaining fairness.  

### Potential Considerations:  
- **State Law Limitations**: Some jurisdictions restrict indemnification for a party’s own negligence (e.g., anti-indemnity statutes in construction contracts).  
- **Insurance Alignment**: Parties should verify their insurance policies align with these obligations.  

This clause is a **robust mutual indemnification provision**, typical in agreements where both parties seek to share liability risks equitably. Would you like help refining it for a specific context (e.g., jurisdiction, industry)?",5
mutual indemnification provisions,988610fe80,"Section 9.1 Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX, each Party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the ""Indemnified Parties"") from and against all Losses imposed upon or incurred by an Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of or resulting from the Indemnifying Party's or its Affiliates' material breach of this Agreement, except to the extent that such Losses are primarily caused by the Indemnified Party.","This clause is a **mutual indemnification provision**, which directly addresses your query by establishing reciprocal obligations between the parties to compensate each other for certain losses. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of mutual indemnification:

### Key Features Relevant to the Query:
1. **Mutuality**:  
   - The clause binds **""each Party""** (i.e., both parties to the agreement) as potential **Indemnifying Parties**, ensuring reciprocity. This mutual structure means either party could be liable to indemnify the other, depending on who causes the loss.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - Covers **""all Losses""** arising from the Indemnifying Party’s (or its Affiliates’) **material breach of the Agreement**. This protects both sides against financial harm caused by the other’s significant contractual violations.

3. **Protected Parties**:  
   - Extends protection broadly to the other Party’s **Affiliates, directors, officers, employees**, etc. (the **""Indemnified Parties""**), ensuring comprehensive coverage for both sides’ stakeholders.

4. **Limitation of Liability**:  
   - The indemnification is **not absolute**. Losses **primarily caused by the Indemnified Party** are excluded, preventing a party from claiming indemnity for its own wrongdoing. This balances mutual protection with accountability.

5. **Procedural Safeguards**:  
   - The clause is **subject to Article IX’s limitations** (e.g., caps on liability, notice requirements, or exclusions), which are typical in mutual indemnification to ensure fairness and practicality.

### Why This Matters for Mutual Indemnification:  
- **Risk Allocation**: It ensures both parties share responsibility for breaches, rather than placing the burden solely on one side.  
- **Legal Protection**: Provides a remedy for the non-breaching party while discouraging frivolous claims through the ""primarily caused by"" exception.  
- **Negotiation Insight**: Parties reviewing this clause might negotiate the definitions of ""Losses,"" ""material breach,"" or the scope of exclusions to further tailor mutual obligations.  

In summary, this clause exemplifies a **balanced mutual indemnification provision**, critical for contracts where both parties assume comparable risks. It answers your query by demonstrating how such provisions are structured to protect both sides equitably.",5
mutual indemnification provisions,94ea6e0069,"11. Indemnification and Insurance. 11.1. Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party, and its directors, officers, employees and agents, from and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs (collectively, ""Liabilities""), resulting from any claims, demands, actions or other proceedings by any third party to the extent resulting from the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by the breaching party under this Agreement.","The **mutual indemnification provision** in the clause you provided is directly relevant to your query because it establishes a **reciprocal obligation** between both parties to compensate each other for certain third-party claims arising from breaches of the agreement. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of mutual indemnification:

### Key Elements of Mutual Indemnification in the Clause:
1. **Reciprocal Obligation**  
   - The clause states that **""Each party shall indemnify...""**, meaning both parties (not just one) are bound to protect the other. This mutuality ensures neither party bears disproportionate liability for third-party claims caused by the other’s breaches.

2. **Scope of Coverage**  
   - It covers losses resulting from **third-party claims** (e.g., lawsuits, demands) tied to breaches of **representations, warranties, or covenants** in the agreement. This is a classic feature of mutual indemnification, where both parties share the risk of external legal actions.

3. **Protected Parties**  
   - The indemnification extends not just to the other party but also to its **directors, officers, employees, and agents**, reinforcing mutual protection for both sides’ stakeholders.

4. **Types of Liabilities Covered**  
   - The clause specifies **""all losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses""** (including legal fees), ensuring comprehensive coverage for indemnifiable events.

### Why This Matters for Mutual Indemnification:
- **Balanced Risk Allocation**: Neither party is solely responsible for third-party claims; liability follows the breaching party.  
- **Encourages Compliance**: Both parties have an incentive to uphold their contractual promises, knowing they could be liable for the other’s losses if they breach.  
- **Legal Efficiency**: By defining the scope (e.g., breaches of reps/warranties), the clause reduces disputes over what qualifies for indemnification.  

### Potential Considerations:
- **Limitations**: The clause does not address **negligence, intentional misconduct, or IP infringement**—common carve-outs or additions in mutual indemnification.  
- **Survival**: Check if indemnification obligations persist after the agreement terminates (often addressed separately).  

In summary, this clause is a straightforward example of **mutual indemnification**, where both parties agree to shield each other from third-party claims arising from their own contractual breaches. For a robust provision, you might also assess whether it includes **defense obligations, notice requirements, or exclusions** (e.g., for consequential damages).

Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.","This **indemnification clause** is a **one-way indemnity** (not mutual) where only the **Provider** agrees to indemnify the **Recipient** and its related parties (the ""Indemnified Party"").  

### **Relevance to ""Mutual Indemnification Provisions""**  
1. **Comparison to Mutual Indemnity**  
   - A **mutual indemnification** clause would require **both parties** (Provider and Recipient) to indemnify each other under specified conditions.  
   - Here, only the **Provider** is obligated to indemnify the Recipient, meaning it is **unilateral**, not mutual.  

2. **Key Elements Covered (Applicable to Mutual Indemnity Too)**  
   - **Scope of Indemnity**: Covers third-party claims, negligence, willful misconduct, and breach of contract.  
   - **Defense Obligation**: Provider must defend the Recipient (not just reimburse).  
   - **Covered Losses**: Broadly defined (legal fees, settlements, damages, etc.).  
   - **Settlement Control**: Provider cannot settle without Recipient’s consent.  

3. **How This Differs from Mutual Indemnity**  
   - If this were **mutual**, the Recipient would also have to indemnify the Provider for its own breaches, negligence, or misconduct.  
   - Mutual indemnity is common in agreements where both parties share risk (e.g., joint ventures, vendor contracts).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **not mutual**—it only protects the Recipient. For a **mutual indemnification**, a reciprocal clause would need to be added obligating the Recipient to indemnify the Provider under similar conditions.

(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The query asks about a **unilateral indemnification clause**, which typically refers to an indemnity obligation that is one-sided (i.e., only one party is required to indemnify the other, rather than mutual). 

### Relevance to the Query:
The clause provided in **Article 9** is **not unilateral**—it is a **mutual indemnification clause** because:  
1. **Both parties are obligated to indemnify each other** (Section 9.1(a) states: *""Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party...""*).  
2. The procedures for claims (Section 9.1(b)) apply equally to both parties, reinforcing the mutual nature of the obligation.  

### Key Differences from a Unilateral Clause:
- A **unilateral indemnification clause** would specify that **only one party** (e.g., a contractor, supplier, or licensee) must indemnify the other (e.g., a client or licensor), often due to an imbalance in risk allocation or bargaining power.  
- This clause, however, imposes **reciprocal duties**, meaning both parties share liability for their respective breaches, negligence, or misconduct.  

### Why This Matters:
If the query sought a unilateral clause, this provision would **not** fit because it requires **both parties** to indemnify. A unilateral version would instead:  
- Limit indemnification to **one party only** (e.g., *""Party A shall indemnify Party B, but Party B shall have no such obligation""*).  
- Often arise in contexts like vendor agreements, where one party assumes all liability risks.

Below is an analysis of its relevance to the query:

### Key Differences:  
1. **Unilateral vs. Mutual Indemnification**  
   - A **unilateral clause** would require **only one party** to indemnify the other (e.g., ""Party A shall indemnify Party B..."").  
   - The given clause is **mutual** because it states:  
     > *""The Parties **shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other**...""*  
     This means **both parties** have equal indemnification obligations.  

2. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - If the user sought a unilateral clause, this example does **not** fit, as it imposes reciprocal duties.  
   - However, it illustrates how indemnification clauses are structured (covering losses, liabilities, attorney fees, etc.) and could be modified to make it unilateral by restricting the obligation to one party.  

### Key Elements in the Clause:  
- **Scope**: Covers losses from injuries, damages, negligence, and legal claims.  
- **Parties Covered**: Extends to heirs, successors, and assigns.  
- **Trigger**: Applies to liabilities ""arising in whole or in part"" from the agreement.  

### Suggested Revision for Unilateral Indemnification:  
If unilateral protection is needed (e.g., only Party A indemnifies Party B), the clause could be rewritten as:

the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement.","The clause you provided is a **mutual indemnification clause**, not a **unilateral indemnification clause**. Here’s the distinction and relevance to your query:

### **1. Mutual vs. Unilateral Indemnification**  
- **Mutual Indemnification (Current Clause):**  
  - Both parties agree to indemnify each other under the specified conditions (breach, gross negligence, or willful misconduct).  
  - Each party takes on the role of both **Indemnifying Party** and **Indemnified Party**, depending on who is at fault.  

- **Unilateral Indemnification:**  
  - Only **one party** (typically the party with more leverage, like a service provider or stronger contractual position) agrees to indemnify the other.  
  - The other party does **not** provide reciprocal indemnification.  

### **2. Relevance to Your Query**  
Since you asked about a **unilateral indemnification clause**, this clause does **not** meet that requirement because it imposes indemnification obligations on **both parties equally**.  

### **3. How to Modify for a Unilateral Clause**  
To make it unilateral, you would:  
- Remove the reciprocal obligation (e.g., replace **""Each Party""** with **""[Only Party X]""**).  
- Specify that only **one party** is responsible for indemnifying the other.  

**Example of a Unilateral Version:**  
> *""10.1 Indemnification. **[Party A]** (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless **[Party B]** and its Affiliates [...] from and against any and all losses [...] arising out of (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement; or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party.""*  

### **4. Key Takeaways**  
- The current clause is **mutual**, meaning both parties indemnify each other.  
- A **unilateral clause** would shift the indemnity burden to **only one party**.  
- Unilateral clauses are common in contracts where one party assumes greater risk (e.g., vendors, service providers, or licensors).

2. **Unilateral Indemnification (What You Asked About)**  
   - Only **one party** (typically the weaker or more at-risk party) is required to indemnify the other.

### Relevance to the Query:
The provided clause (**Sections 6.1 and 6.2**) is **not unilateral** but rather **mutual/bilateral**, as it establishes reciprocal indemnification obligations between the **Owner** and the **Operator**. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Section 6.1**: Owner indemnifies Operator for losses arising from:  
   - Owner's breaches, negligence, or intentional acts.  
   - Excludes Operator’s own misconduct or breaches.  

2. **Section 6.2**: Operator indemnifies Owner for losses arising from:

   - Excludes Owner’s own misconduct or breaches.  

### Key Differences from a Unilateral Clause:
- A unilateral clause would only require **one party** (e.g., Owner) to indemnify the other (Operator) without reciprocity.  
- Here, both parties assume indemnification responsibilities, making it **mutual**.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification**  
- **Third-Party Claims Coverage**: The clause explicitly covers claims, actions, or proceedings brought by third parties (""Third Party Claims"") due to:  
  - Negligence  
  - Intentional misconduct  
  - Breach of the agreement  
- **Financial Protections**: It includes **damages, costs, expenses, attorney’s fees, and court costs** incurred due to such claims.

### **2. Mutual Indemnification Obligations**  
- **VS’s Duty**: Must indemnify PPD (and its affiliates, directors, officers, and employees) if a third-party claim arises from VS’s wrongdoing.  
- **PPD’s Duty**: Must indemnify VS (and its directors, officers, and employees) if a third-party claim arises from PPD’s wrongdoing.  

### **3. Procedural Requirements**  
- **Notice**: The indemnified party must **promptly notify** the indemnifying party of a third-party claim.  
- **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party has the **right to control the defense and settlement**, but must act in **good faith**.  
- **Cooperation**: The indemnified party must **reasonably cooperate** in the defense.  
- **Right to Participate**: The indemnified party may **join the defense at its own expense**, unless:  
  - The indemnifying party **authorizes separate counsel** (covered by indemnifier), or  
  - The indemnifying party **fails to defend** (then the indemnified party takes control).  

### **4. Why This Matters for the Query**  
This clause ensures that:  
- **Third-party claims are properly allocated** to the party responsible (VS or PPD).  
- **Legal costs are covered** by the party at fault.  
- **Defense strategies are managed efficiently**, with clear rules on control and participation.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause provides a **structured, mutual indemnification framework** for third-party claims, ensuring financial protection and legal clarity for both parties. It balances **control, cooperation, and cost responsibility**, making it highly relevant to the query.

8.2 No Consequential Damages. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT AWARDED TO A THIRD PARTY IN A JUDGMENT AGAINST WHICH A PARTY IS ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 7.2 [Indemnity], OR TO THE EXTENT ARISING OUT OF ANY BREACH OF SECTION 11.4 [Nondisclosure], NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY), TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR COST OF COVER OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS OR DATA) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISEDOF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH COSTS OR DAMAGES. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 8.2 [No Consequential Damages] IS INTENDED TO LIMIT ANY RIGHT OF ACSI TO RECEIVE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.5.2 [Effect of Termination].","This indemnification clause is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims""** because it defines the scope, obligations, and limitations of indemnity between the parties (Audible and its counterparty) for claims brought by third parties. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Definition of ""Claim"" (Third-Party Claims)**  
The clause explicitly defines a **""Claim""** as any legal action or proceeding initiated by a **third party** (excluding affiliates of either party), including governmental authorities. This sets the foundation for indemnification obligations when external parties sue or make demands.

### **2. Indemnification Obligations**  
The clause outlines **four key scenarios** where one party (the **Indemnifying Party**) must defend and indemnify the other (the **Indemnified Party**) against third-party claims:  
   - **(a)** Claims arising from the **operation or content** of the Indemnifying Party’s website (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
   - **(b)** Claims related to **products/services marketed or sold** through the Indemnifying Party’s site (with exceptions for the Indemnified Party’s products).  
   - **(c)** Claims due to a **breach of representations/warranties** or regulatory compliance failures.  
   - **(d)** Claims alleging **intellectual property infringement** from materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  

This ensures that each party bears responsibility for liabilities stemming from their own actions, content, or compliance failures.

### **3. Scope of Covered Losses**  
The indemnity covers:  
   - **Legal costs** (attorneys’ fees, judgments, awards).  
   - **Damages and expenses** arising from third-party claims.  
   - **Defense obligations** (the Indemnifying Party must defend the Indemnified Party).  

### **4. Interaction with Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**  
The clause clarifies that **indemnification overrides the general exclusion of consequential damages** in the agreement. If a third party successfully claims consequential damages (e.g., lost profits) against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party must cover those costs **if the claim falls under Section 7.2**.  

### **5. Exclusions & Limitations**  
   - **Affiliate claims** are excluded (only third-party claims apply).  
   - **Indemnified Party’s own misconduct** (e.g., supplying infringing materials) may limit indemnity.  
   - **Procedural requirements** (Section 7.3, omitted here) likely impose notice and cooperation duties.  

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
This clause directly addresses **how third-party claims are handled** between the parties:  
   - It **shifts liability** to the party responsible for the underlying issue (e.g., IP infringement, regulatory violations).  
   - It ensures **financial protection** for the innocent party against third-party lawsuits.  
   - It **harmonizes with other liability terms** (e.g., consequential damages are excluded unless indemnification applies).  

In summary, this clause provides a **commercial risk-allocation mechanism** where each party assumes responsibility for third-party claims tied to their own operations, content, or breaches, while carving out exceptions for the other party’s faults.",5

7.2 Indemnity. Each Party (as applicable, the ""Indemnifying Party"") will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party (the ""Indemnified Party"") and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors and representatives) from and against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any Claim, to the extent it is based on (a) the operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's Site (other than any items or materials supplied, or operation or content required, by the Indemnified Party), (b) the offer, marketing or sale of any products or services through the Indemnifying Party's Site (other than any products offered, marketed or sold by the Indemnified Party through such Site, the Parties acknowledging that Company shall be deemed the Indemnifying Party as to any Claim related to any products offered, marketed or sold by Company through the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section and/or Mirror Company Site, except to the extent that such Claim relates to any ACSI Site Functionality or other items or content provided by or for ACSI with respect to the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section and/or Mirror Company Site), (c) any actual or alleged breach of the Indemnifying Party's representations or warranties set forth in Section 7.1 [Representations] above, or, in the case of Company, its obligations under Section 4.4 [Regulatory Compliance] above, or (d) any actual or alleged infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights by any content, items or materials provided by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party for its use under this Agreement. Subject to Section 7.3 [Procedure], the Indemnifying Party will pay any award against the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors or representatives) and any costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by them resulting from any such Claim.","This **indemnification clause** is directly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims""** because it outlines the obligations of each party (the **""Indemnifying Party""**) to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party (the **""Indemnified Party""**) against claims brought by third parties. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Definition of ""Claim"" (Third-Party Claims Covered)**  
- The clause defines **""Claim""** broadly to include any **legal action by a third party** (excluding affiliates), such as lawsuits, regulatory actions, or other proceedings.  
- This ensures that indemnification applies to **external legal risks**, not just disputes between the parties themselves.

### **2. Scope of Indemnification**  
The Indemnifying Party must cover:  
- **Legal costs** (attorneys' fees, judgments, settlements).  
- **Damages/losses** arising from third-party claims related to:  
  - **Operation/content of the Indemnifying Party’s site** (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
  - **Products/services sold via their site** (with exceptions for the other party’s products).  
  - **Breach of representations/warranties** (e.g., false promises in Section 7.1).  
  - **IP infringement** due to materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  

### **3. Key Protections for Third-Party Claims**  
- **Defense obligation**: The Indemnifying Party must **defend** the Indemnified Party against lawsuits.  
- **Financial responsibility**: Covers **awards, legal fees, and expenses** from third-party claims.  
- **Regulatory compliance**: Explicitly includes claims tied to violations of laws (e.g., Section 4.4 obligations).  

### **4. Limitations & Carve-Outs**  
- Indemnification **does not apply** to claims caused by the Indemnified Party’s own actions (e.g., their content or products).  
- **Procedural requirements** (Section 7.3) likely dictate how claims must be reported and handled.  

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
This clause **directly addresses indemnification for third-party claims** by:  
1. Defining what constitutes a covered claim.  
2. Allocating liability between parties based on who caused the issue.  
3. Ensuring legal and financial protection against external lawsuits or regulatory actions.  

In essence, it shifts the risk of third-party disputes to the party responsible for the underlying issue (e.g., IP infringement, regulatory violations, or faulty products), providing clear recourse for the innocent party.

indemnification of third party claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","This indemnification clause is directly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims""** because it outlines the obligations of each party to protect the other from liabilities arising from third-party claims. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Relevance to Third-Party Claims:
1. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - The clause requires each party to indemnify the other against **""any and all claims... arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action""** brought by third parties.  
   - This includes claims that contradict the warranties, representations, or agreements made by the indemnifying party in the contract. For example, if a third party sues Party A because Party B breached a warranty, Party B must cover Party A’s losses.

2. **Covered Liabilities**:  
   - The indemnification extends to **damages, legal costs, attorneys' fees, and other expenses** tied to third-party claims. This ensures the non-breaching party isn’t financially burdened by disputes caused by the other party’s misrepresentations or failures.

3. **Withholding Rights for Pending Claims**:  
   - If a third-party claim is unresolved, the non-indemnifying party (the one not at fault) can **withhold payments** owed to the other party in an amount reasonably tied to the claim. This acts as security against potential liabilities.

### Why It Matters for Third-Party Claims:
- **Risk Allocation**: It shifts the risk of third-party claims to the party responsible for the breach (e.g., if their false warranty triggered the claim).  
- **Financial Protection**: Ensures the innocent party isn’t left paying for legal battles or settlements caused by the other’s non-compliance.  
- **Proactive Safeguard**: The withholding provision prevents the indemnifying party from avoiding liability by delaying resolution.

### Example Scenario:
If Party B represents in the contract that it owns certain intellectual property, but a third party sues Party A for infringement, Party B must indemnify Party A for all related costs. Meanwhile, Party A can withhold payments to Party B until the lawsuit is resolved.

In summary, this clause explicitly addresses indemnification for third-party claims by defining responsibilities, covered costs, and protective measures during disputes.",5
indemnification of third party claims,7db40e2087,"10. INDEMNITY. Each party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") shall indemnify the other party (the ""Indemnified Party"") against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which the Indemnified Party may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from: (x) the Indemnifying Party's acts, omissions or misrepresentations to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is deemed an agent of the Indemnified Party, or (y) the Indemnifying Party's breach of its privacy policy.

In addition, Boxlot shall indemnify theglobe against any and all claims, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which theglobe may incur as a result of claims in any form by third parties arising from Boxlot Banners, Boxlot Content, Boxlot Marks, the Service (excluding the Page Templates or theglobe Marks) or Boxlot's breach of Section 12.1 [Compliance with Laws]. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the Indemnified Party: (i) giving the Indemnifying Party notice of the relevant claim, (ii) cooperating with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in the defense of such claim, and (iii) giving the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense and settlement of any such claim, except that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that affects the Indemnified Party's rights or interest without the Indemnified Party's prior written approval. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense at its expense.","This **indemnification clause** is directly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims""** because it outlines the obligations of each party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") to protect the other (the ""Indemnified Party"") from legal and financial liabilities arising from third-party claims. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause Relevant to Third-Party Claims:**
1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   - The clause covers **claims, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees)** incurred due to third-party claims.  
   - It applies to claims arising from:  
     - The Indemnifying Party’s **acts, omissions, or misrepresentations** (if deemed an agent of the other party).  
     - The Indemnifying Party’s **breach of its privacy policy**.  
     - Specific obligations for **theglobe** (indemnifying Boxlot for claims from **Page Templates or theglobe Marks**).  
     - Specific obligations for **Boxlot** (indemnifying theglobe for claims from **Boxlot Banners, Content, Marks, the Service, or breach of laws**).  

2. **Conditions for Indemnification**  
   The Indemnified Party must:  
   - **Notify** the Indemnifying Party of the claim.  
   - **Cooperate** in the defense (at the Indemnifying Party’s expense).  
   - Allow the Indemnifying Party to **control the defense and settlement**, but no settlement affecting the Indemnified Party’s rights can occur without **prior written approval**.  

3. **Right to Participate in Defense**  
   - The Indemnified Party may join the defense **at its own expense** if it chooses.  

### **Why This Matters for Third-Party Claims**  
- It ensures that if a third party sues one party (**e.g., a customer suing Boxlot due to theglobe’s Page Templates**), the responsible party (**theglobe**) covers the costs.  
- It prevents one party from being unfairly burdened by legal risks caused by the other’s actions.  
- It sets clear **procedural rules** (notice, cooperation, control of defense) to manage claims efficiently.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is a **risk-shifting mechanism** that allocates responsibility for third-party claims based on which party’s actions (or failures) caused the claim. It protects both parties from unexpected liabilities while ensuring proper handling of disputes.

Here’s how the clauses are relevant:

### **1. Exclusion of Liability Limitations for Fraud/Gross Negligence (Sections 11.6 and 11.7)**  
- **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** generally excludes liability for indirect/consequential damages **except** in specific cases, including:  
  - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (**subsection (E)**).  
  - Indemnification obligations under **Article 12** (**subsection (F)**).  
  This means that if a party commits **fraud or gross negligence**, the other party **can** seek consequential damages (e.g., lost profits) despite the general exclusion.  

- **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** caps a party’s total liability **unless** the claim involves:  
  - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (**subsection (a)(V)**).  
  - Indemnification obligations under **Article 12** (**subsection (a)(VI)**).  
  Thus, liability for fraud/gross negligence is **uncapped**, exposing the at-fault party to full damages.  

### **2. Indemnification for Fraud/Gross Negligence (Sections 12.1 and 12.2)**  
- **Section 12.1 (BLI’s Indemnity Obligation)** requires BLI to indemnify Ginkgo for Third-Party Claims/Losses arising from:  
  - BLI’s **breach of contract**, **material misrepresentation**, or **fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct** (**subsection (b)**).  
  - This ensures Ginkgo is protected if BLI’s intentional or reckless acts cause harm.  

- **Section 12.2 (Ginkgo’s Indemnity Obligation)** mirrors this, requiring Ginkgo to indemnify BLI for its own:  
  - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (**subsection (b)**).  
  - Other breaches or third-party claims related to commercialization (**subsection (e)**).  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
1. **Fraud/gross negligence carve-outs**: The contract **does not shield** a party from liability for fraud or gross negligence—consequential damages and liability caps do **not** apply.  
2. **Indemnification applies**: The at-fault party must **defend and cover losses** (including third-party claims) stemming from its fraud/gross negligence.  
3. **Willful misconduct treated similarly**: The clauses group fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct together, imposing the same consequences.  

### **Practical Implications**  
- A party engaging in fraud or gross negligence **cannot rely on liability limitations** and may face uncapped damages.  
- The indemnification clauses ensure the harmed party is compensated for third-party claims arising from such misconduct.  
- These provisions align with common legal principles that **prohibit parties from insulating themselves from intentional or egregious wrongdoing**.

Here’s how:

### **1. Exclusion of Liability Limitations for Fraud/Gross Negligence**  
- **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** explicitly state that the contractual limitations on liability (e.g., exclusion of consequential damages, caps on liability) **do not apply** to claims arising from:  
  - **Fraud**  
  - **Gross negligence**  
  - **Willful misconduct**  
  - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12**  

  This means that if a party commits fraud or gross negligence, the other party can seek **full remedies**, including consequential damages, even if the contract otherwise restricts such recovery.

### **2. Indemnification for Fraud/Gross Negligence**  
- **Section 12.1 (BLI’s Indemnification)** and **Section 12.2 (Ginkgo’s Indemnification)** require each party to indemnify the other for **Third-Party Claims** caused by:  
  - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** by their respective indemnitees (e.g., employees, agents).  
  - This ensures that if a third party sues due to fraud or gross negligence by one party’s representatives, the responsible party must cover the losses.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
1. **No Liability Shield for Bad Acts**: The contract does not protect a party from liability if they engage in fraud or gross negligence—they can be sued for **full damages** (including indirect/consequential losses).  
2. **Indemnification Obligations**: Each party must defend and compensate the other for third-party claims stemming from their own fraud/gross negligence.  
3. **Preservation of Legal Rights**: The clauses ensure that remedies for intentional or egregious misconduct remain available, overriding general liability limitations.  

### **Practical Implications**  
- If a party alleges fraud or gross negligence, they can bypass the contract’s liability caps and exclusions.  
- The indemnification provisions ensure that third-party claims (e.g., lawsuits from customers or regulators) arising from such misconduct are covered by the at-fault party.

Here’s how they are relevant:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Exclusion from Liability Limitations for Fraud/Gross Negligence**  
   - Both clauses carve out exceptions to the general limitations on liability (e.g., no consequential damages, capped aggregate liability) for claims arising from **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (Sections 11.6(E) and 11.7(a)(V)).  
   - This means a party **can** be held fully liable for direct, indirect, or consequential damages if their actions involve fraud or gross negligence. The standard liability caps or exclusions do not apply in such cases.

2. **Indemnification Linkage**  
   - Section 11.6(F) and 11.7(a)(VI) also exclude indemnification obligations (under Article 12) from liability limitations. If fraud/gross negligence triggers indemnification, the indemnifying party’s liability remains uncapped.  
   - This ensures that indemnity claims related to fraud/gross negligence are not restricted by the agreement’s general liability protections.

3. **Policy Rationale**  
   - The clauses reflect a common contractual approach: parties may agree to limit liability for ordinary breaches or negligence but **not for egregious misconduct** (fraud, gross negligence, or willful acts). This aligns with legal principles that often prohibit shielding parties from liability for intentional or reckless wrongdoing.

### Practical Implications:
- A party seeking indemnification for losses caused by the other party’s **fraud or gross negligence** can pursue full damages (including consequential or uncapped amounts), bypassing the agreement’s standard liability restrictions.  
- Conversely, a party accused of fraud/gross negligence cannot rely on the liability limits in Sections 11.6 or 11.7 as a defense.

### Summary:
The clauses explicitly **preserve liability and indemnity obligations for fraud/gross negligence**, ensuring such claims are treated more severely than ordinary breaches. This directly addresses the query by confirming that indemnity for fraud/gross negligence is **not subject to the agreement’s liability caps or exclusions**.",5

Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Exclusion for Fraud/Gross Negligence**:  
   - The clause states that the limitation of liability **does not apply** to losses arising from:  
     - **Fraud**  
     - **Willful misconduct**  
     - **Gross negligence** (listed under exception (A)).  
   - This means a party **can still be held liable** for indirect, consequential, or other damages if they result from fraud or gross negligence, even though such damages are otherwise excluded under the agreement.

2. **Indemnification Context**:  
   - The clause ties into indemnification by clarifying that liability for certain damages (e.g., indirect or punitive) is waived **unless** they fall under the exceptions (A)-(D).  
   - For fraud/gross negligence, the parties retain full exposure to these damages, which could be critical in indemnity claims.  

3. **Link to Confidentiality and Exclusivity**:  
   - The clause also preserves liability for breaches of **Article 9 (Confidentiality)** and **Section 5.8 (Exclusivity)** (exception (B)), showing that fraud/gross negligence is treated similarly to other high-stakes breaches.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Fraud/Gross Negligence Claims**: If a party alleges fraud or gross negligence, they can seek recovery for **all types of damages** (including indirect/consequential), which would otherwise be barred.  
- **Indemnity Scope**: The clause ensures that indemnification obligations (e.g., under Article 11) are not undermined by the general liability waiver when fraud/gross negligence is involved.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:
The clause explicitly **preserves liability exposure** for fraud and gross negligence, making it a critical carve-out in indemnity discussions. It ensures that a party cannot shield itself from liability for intentional or egregious misconduct, even if the contract broadly limits damages for ordinary breaches.

ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided (Section 9.5 ""Limitation of Liability"") is relevant to the query about **fraud and/or gross negligence indemnity** in the following ways:

### **1. Fraud Exception to Liability Limitation**  
The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability **does not apply** in cases of **fraud** (Section 9.5(I)). This means:  
- If a party commits **fraudulent acts**, they **cannot rely on this clause** to avoid liability.  
- Fraud is treated as a carve-out, meaning the injured party can still claim **full damages** (including indirect, consequential, or punitive damages) that would otherwise be excluded under the limitation.  

### **2. Gross Negligence (Implied Exclusion)**  
While the clause does not explicitly mention **gross negligence**, it broadly excludes liability for damages arising from:  
- **Negligence** (ordinary negligence)  
- **Breach of statutory duty**  
- **Tort claims**  

However, many jurisdictions treat **gross negligence** differently from ordinary negligence. If gross negligence is not explicitly excluded, courts may interpret the clause as **not barring claims** for grossly negligent conduct.  
- If the parties intended to exclude liability for gross negligence, it should have been **expressly stated** (e.g., ""except in cases of fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence"").  
- Since it is not mentioned, a court might allow claims for gross negligence despite the limitation.  

### **3. Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause also clarifies that the limitation **does not apply** to damages paid to a **third party** under indemnification obligations (Section 9.5(II)).  
- If a third party sues due to fraud or gross negligence by one party, the indemnifying party **cannot use this clause** to avoid liability.  
- This ensures that indemnification obligations remain enforceable even if the limitation applies between the contracting parties.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Fraud is fully carve out**—no liability protection.  
- **Gross negligence is not explicitly addressed**, so liability may still apply depending on jurisdiction.  
- **Indemnity obligations override the limitation** when third-party claims are involved.  

### **Recommendation for Clarity**  
If the parties want to **exclude liability for gross negligence**, the clause should be amended to explicitly state:  
*""Except in cases of fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence...""*

Section 10.2 NCM General Indemnification. NCM shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Network Affiliate and its Representatives from and against any and all Costs suffered or incurred in connection with or as a result of, and from and against any and all third party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings actually or allegedly arising out of, based upon, or relating to, (i) any breach by NCM of Article IX, or (ii) NCM's fraud, willful misconduct, or noncompliance with law.
Section 10.3 NCM Infringement Indemnification.
(a) Indemnifications Obligations. NCM shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Network Affiliate and its Representatives from and against any and all Costs suffered or incurred arising from any and all third party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings to the extent actually or allegedly arising out of, based upon, or relating to any infringement by the NCM Property (but excluding any Equipment) of any third party U.S. trademark, copyright, or patent issued as of the Effective Date, arising from Network Affiliate's use of the NCM Property in accordance and compliance with this Agreement.
(b) Additional Remedies. In addition to, but not in limitation of, NCM's obligations under Section 10.3 (a) above, NCM may, at its sole option, in the event that any claim, suit, proceeding, or action is brought or threatened for which NCM may be obligated under Section 10.3 (a) to indemnify Network Affiliate: (i) replace or modify the NCM Property to render it non-infringing; (ii) secure for Network Affiliate the right to use the NCM Property; or (iii) terminate this Agreement under the provisions of Article X. In the event NCM chooses to terminate this Agreement under Article X hereof, NCM shall refund to Network Affiliate the portion (if any) of the total amount of license fees actually paid to NCM by Network Affiliate hereunder during the two-year period immediately preceding the date of the claim for indemnification, depreciated according to a five-year straight line depreciation.
(c) Limitations of Obligations. NCM shall not have any liability to Network Affiliate under this Section 10.3 for any alleged infringement based in any part on: (i) any Service content or Confidential Information supplied by or on behalf of Network Affiliate; (ii) the combined use of the NCM Property with software or hardware products or other technology or materials not provided or owned by NCM; (iii) additions or modifications to the NCM Property not made by NCM; (iv) use or installation of the NCM Property in accordance with designs or specifications not provided by NCM; or (v) use of any legacy or superseded version of NCM Property if such infringement would have been avoided by use of a more recent version of the NCM Property made available to Network Affiliate. The obligations under this Section 10.3 state the entire liability of NCM and are Network Affiliate's sole and exclusive remedies, with respect to intellectual property infringement.
Section 10.4 Defense of Action. A Party offering indemnification or defense under this Article X (each, an ""Indemnitor"") shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of any and all claims, suits, proceedings, and actions for which such Indemnitor is obligated to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend hereunder, but the Party or Representative of a Party receiving such indemnification or defense under this Article X (each, the ""Indemnitee"") shall have the right to participate in such claims, suits, proceedings, and actions at its own cost and expense.

Under no circumstance shall either party hereto settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any claim, suit, proceeding, or action that is the subject of indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably.","This indemnification clause is highly relevant to the query about **third-party IP infringement indemnity** because it outlines the obligations of both parties (Network Affiliate and NCM) to defend and indemnify each other against claims arising from intellectual property (IP) infringement by third parties. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Third-Party IP Infringement Coverage**  
The clause explicitly addresses indemnification for third-party claims related to IP infringement (trademarks, copyrights, and patents) in two key sections:  
- **Section 10.1(ii)**: Network Affiliate indemnifies NCM if materials (e.g., content, branding) provided by Network Affiliate infringe a third party’s U.S. patent, trademark, or copyright.  
- **Section 10.3(a)**: NCM indemnifies Network Affiliate if NCM’s property (excluding equipment) infringes a third party’s U.S. IP rights, provided the infringement arises from Network Affiliate’s authorized use.  

### **2. Scope and Limitations**  
- **Covered IP Types**: The clause specifies **U.S. patents, trademarks, and copyrights**, limiting indemnity to IP rights issued as of the **Effective Date** (Section 10.3(a)).  
- **Exclusions**: NCM’s indemnity does not apply if infringement results from:  
  - Network Affiliate’s modifications or combined use with non-NCM products (Section 10.3(c)(ii–iv)).  
  - Use of outdated NCM Property when a non-infringing version was available (Section 10.3(c)(v)).  

### **3. Remedies for Infringement**  
Beyond monetary indemnification, **Section 10.3(b)** allows NCM to:  
- Replace/modify the infringing property.  
- Secure a license for continued use.  
- Terminate the agreement (with a refund provision).  

### **4. Procedural Requirements**  
- **Notice**: The indemnitee must promptly notify the indemnitor to avoid prejudicing the defense (Section 10.4).  
- **Control of Defense**: The indemnitor controls the defense/settlement, but the indemnitee may participate at its own cost.  
- **Settlement Consent**: Neither party can settle without the other’s **reasonable** written consent (Section 10.4).  

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
This clause directly answers concerns about **third-party IP infringement risks** by:  
1. Defining **who bears liability** (Network Affiliate for its content; NCM for its property).  
2. Setting **boundaries** (U.S. IP only, exclusions for misuse/modifications).  
3. Providing **practical remedies** (repair, replace, license, or terminate).  
4. Establishing **procedural safeguards** (notice, defense control, settlement approval).  

In summary, it allocates responsibility for IP infringement claims while protecting both parties from uncontrolled liability.",5
third party IP infringement indemnity,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","This clause is relevant to the query about **third-party IP infringement indemnity** because it explicitly carves out an exception for liabilities arising from third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement claims. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement Claims**:  
   The clause states that the general limitation of liability (which excludes ""special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages"") **does not apply** to claims or liabilities stemming from third-party IP infringement. This means:  
   - If one party’s actions (e.g., use of licensed technology) infringe a third party’s IP rights (e.g., patents, copyrights, trademarks), the other party **may still hold them liable** for damages that would otherwise be excluded (e.g., consequential damages like lost profits).  
   - This exception ensures that IP-related risks are treated separately and not shielded by the broader liability cap.

2. **No Indemnity Provided Here**:  
   While the clause acknowledges that third-party IP infringement claims are treated differently, it **does not itself provide indemnity** (i.e., it doesn’t state which party will defend or compensate the other for such claims). Instead, it preserves the right to pursue liability for IP infringement outside the standard damages exclusions.  
   - A separate **indemnity clause** would typically address who covers costs (e.g., legal fees, settlements) for third-party IP claims. This clause complements such an indemnity by clarifying that IP claims aren’t subject to the same liability limits.

3. **Practical Implication**:  
   - If Party A’s product infringes a third party’s patent, Party B (e.g., a licensee or partner) could sue Party A not just for direct damages but also for **consequential losses** (e.g., lost sales due to an injunction).  
   - Without this exception, Party B might be barred from claiming these broader damages under the general liability limitation.

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause ensures that third-party IP infringement risks remain **unshielded by the contract’s standard liability protections**, leaving room for negotiated indemnity terms or legal recourse. For full protection, parties should pair this with a clear **IP indemnity clause** specifying defense obligations and reimbursement terms.",5

In case any Product, or any part thereof, if such suit is held to constitute an infringement and the use of said Product or part is enjoined, Company shall, in its sole discretion and at its own expense, either procure for the indemnitee the right to continue using said Product or provide or procure for the Distributor a similar product.
4.02 Trademark Infringement. The Company has registered the mark Snotarator ™ in the United States. Distributor agrees it will not at any time, either during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, use the Brand, Products or Snotarator™ mark in any manner that might infringe upon the Company's ownership rights to same directly or indirectly. Distributor shall indemnify and hold the Company and its affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, judgments, costs, awards, expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) and liabilities of every kind arising from Distributor's fault or negligence in its use of the Snotarator ™ mark and in the marketing and distribution of the Products within the Territory.","The query relates to **third-party IP infringement indemnity**, which concerns protection against claims arising from alleged infringement of intellectual property (IP) rights by third parties. The provided clauses address this in the following ways:

### **Relevance to Third-Party IP Infringement Indemnity:**
1. **General Indemnity (Clause 9.03(c))**  
   - The Distributor indemnifies the Company for claims arising from **acts of third parties** related to Products sold under the agreement (e.g., liens, security interests).  
   - This is a broad indemnity but does not specifically cover IP infringement by third parties—it focuses more on financial/legal claims unrelated to IP.

2. **Patent Infringement (Clause 4.01)**  
   - The **Company** indemnifies the Distributor and its customers against third-party claims alleging that the **Product infringes patents, copyrights, or proprietary rights**.  
   - Key protections:  
     - Covers legal costs, damages, and injunctions.  
     - Requires prompt notice and cooperation from the Distributor.  
     - If infringement is proven, the Company must either:  
       - Secure rights for continued use, or  
       - Replace the infringing Product with a non-infringing alternative.  
   - **This directly addresses third-party IP infringement risks related to the Product itself.**

3. **Trademark Infringement (Clause 4.02)**  
   - The **Distributor** indemnifies the Company for claims arising from the Distributor’s **unauthorized use of the ""Snotarator™"" mark** or improper marketing/distribution.  
   - This is a **reverse indemnity** (Distributor → Company) and applies when the Distributor’s actions trigger third-party IP claims (e.g., misuse of trademarks).  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query:**
- **Patent/Copyright Infringement (Product-Related):** Covered by the Company’s indemnity (Clause 4.01).  
- **Trademark Infringement (Distributor’s Actions):** Covered by the Distributor’s indemnity (Clause 4.02).  
- **Other Third-Party Claims (Non-IP):** Covered under general indemnity (Clause 9.03(c)).  

The clauses collectively allocate liability for third-party IP infringement:  
- **Company bears risk for Product design/technology.**  
- **Distributor bears risk for misuse of branding/marketing.**

indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,a1f2e7f3dd,"12. Indemnification. VS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PPD, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any claim, action or proceeding by a third party (a ""Third Party Claim"") arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","This indemnification clause is directly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement""** because it outlines the obligations of both parties (VS and PPD) to protect each other from third-party claims arising from breaches of the agreement, among other triggers. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects Addressing the Query:
1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   - The clause requires **VS** to indemnify PPD (and its affiliates, directors, etc.) for third-party claims resulting from:  
     - VS’s **breach of the agreement**, negligence, or intentional misconduct.  
   - Similarly, **PPD** must indemnify VS (and its directors, etc.) for third-party claims arising from PPD’s **breach of the agreement**, negligence, or misconduct.  
   - This explicitly covers **third-party claims tied to contractual breaches**, which is the core of the query.

2. **Covered Liabilities**  
   - The indemnification includes **damages, costs, expenses, attorney’s fees, and court costs** incurred due to third-party claims. This ensures financial protection for the indemnified party.

3. **Procedural Requirements**  
   - **Notice**: The indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party of a third-party claim.  
   - **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party has the **right to control the defense and settlement** of the claim, provided they act reasonably and in good faith.  
   - **Cooperation**: The indemnified party must cooperate in the defense but may participate (at its own expense unless exceptions apply).  

4. **Exceptions for Control**  
   - If the indemnifying party fails to defend the claim, the indemnified party may **take over control** of the defense (shifting liability risk back to the indemnifying party).  

### Why It Answers the Query:
- The clause **specifically addresses third-party claims** (""Third Party Claims"") stemming from a **breach of the agreement**, which is the focus of the query.  
- It details **who bears responsibility** (indemnifying party) and **how the process works** (notice, defense control, cost allocation).  
- It balances protections for both sides while ensuring due process (e.g., good faith requirements, cooperation duties).  

### Practical Implications:
- If a third party sues PPD because VS breached the agreement (e.g., by failing to deliver services as promised), **VS must cover PPD’s legal costs and liabilities**.  
- Conversely, if a third party sues VS due to PPD’s breach (e.g., non-payment), **PPD must indemnify VS**.  

In summary, this clause is a **mutual indemnification mechanism** tailored to shield both parties from third-party claims arising from breaches of the contract, aligning precisely with the query’s concern.",5
indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,6a700c0c62,"EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","This clause is directly relevant to the query about **indemnification of third-party claims based on a breach of the agreement** in the following ways:

### 1. **Preservation of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
   - The clause explicitly carves out an exception for **indemnification obligations under Section 9** related to **third-party claims**.  
   - This means that while the agreement broadly excludes liability for certain types of damages (e.g., consequential, indirect, punitive), the parties **remain liable for indemnifying each other** against third-party claims arising from a breach of the agreement, as specified in Section 9.

### 2. **Limitation of Liability for Other Damages**  
   - The clause states that **neither party** will be liable for a wide range of damages (e.g., lost profits, punitive damages) arising from a breach of the agreement **except** for indemnification obligations tied to third-party claims.  
   - This reinforces that the **primary recourse for third-party claims** is through indemnification, while other forms of liability are excluded.

### 3. **Scope of Protection**  
   - The exclusion of liability applies **regardless of foreseeability, notice, or legal theory** (contract, tort, etc.), but the indemnification carve-out ensures that third-party claims are still addressed under Section 9.  
   - This creates a clear distinction:  
     - **Indemnification for third-party claims = allowed (per Section 9).**  
     - **Other damages (even from a breach) = excluded.**  

### **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
The clause confirms that while the parties waive most damages for breaches of the agreement, **indemnification obligations for third-party claims survive and are enforceable under Section 9**. This ensures that if a third party sues one party due to the other’s breach, the breaching party must still indemnify the non-breaching party as agreed, even though other types of damages are excluded.

indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,a4b3659d9b,"EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIMS SUBJECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS OF SECTION 9.1 (Payment) OR A BREACH OF EITHER PARTY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 5 (CONFIDENTIALITY), NEITHER PARTY WILL, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","The clause is relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement""** in the following ways:

1. **Indemnification Exception for Third-Party Claims**  
   The clause explicitly carves out an exception for **""amounts payable to third parties in connection with claims subject to the indemnification provisions of Section 9.1 (Payment) or a breach of either party's obligations under Section 5 (Confidentiality).""**  
   - This means that if a third party brings a claim against one party due to the other party's breach (e.g., a breach of confidentiality under Section 5), the breaching party remains liable to indemnify the non-breaching party for such third-party claims.  
   - Without this exception, the broad limitation of liability (excluding lost profits, indirect, or consequential damages) could otherwise shield a party from indemnification obligations for third-party claims.

2. **Limitation of Liability Does Not Apply to Indemnified Claims**  
   The clause states that **neither party is liable for lost profits, special, indirect, or consequential damages**—**except** where such damages arise from third-party claims covered by indemnification (Section 9.1) or confidentiality breaches (Section 5).  
   - Thus, the limitation of liability does **not** protect a party from having to cover third-party claims if they are indemnifiable under the agreement.  

3. **Breach of Confidentiality as a Key Trigger**  
   The clause singles out breaches of **Section 5 (Confidentiality)** as a scenario where indemnification for third-party claims remains enforceable.  
   - If a party’s failure to protect confidential information leads to a third-party claim (e.g., a lawsuit for misused trade secrets), the breaching party cannot avoid liability by invoking the general exclusion of indirect/consequential damages.  

### **Summary of Relevance**  
This clause clarifies that while the parties broadly waive liability for indirect damages (like lost profits), they **cannot** use this waiver to escape indemnification obligations for:  
- Third-party claims covered under **Section 9.1 (Payment)** (e.g., payment-related disputes involving third parties).  
- Third-party claims resulting from a **breach of confidentiality (Section 5)**.  

Thus, it ensures that indemnification rights for third-party claims (arising from specified breaches) remain intact despite the general limitation of liability.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause defines **""Claim""** broadly to include any third-party claim, action, or proceeding (excluding claims by affiliates). The indemnity obligation (Section 7.2) requires the **Indemnifying Party** to:  
- **Defend** (handle legal proceedings),  
- **Indemnify** (reimburse losses), and  
- **Hold harmless** (protect from liability)  
the **Indemnified Party** for claims arising from:  
   - **Breach of representations/warranties** (Section 7.1),  
   - **Breach of regulatory obligations** (Section 4.4),  
   - **Infringement of intellectual property rights**, or  
   - **Other specified wrongful acts** (e.g., issues with the Indemnifying Party’s site or products).  

This directly covers **third-party claims stemming from a party’s breach of the agreement**.

### **2. Exclusion of Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**  
While the clause generally excludes liability for **indirect/consequential damages**, it **carves out an exception** for:  
- **Third-party judgments** covered by indemnification (Section 7.2), or  
- **Breaches of confidentiality (Section 11.4)**.  

This means:  
- If a third party sues due to a breach of the agreement (e.g., misrepresentation or regulatory non-compliance), the Indemnifying Party **must cover the awarded damages**, including consequential damages if imposed by a court.  
- However, **direct claims between the parties** for consequential damages (e.g., lost profits) are excluded unless tied to indemnifiable third-party claims or confidentiality breaches.

### **3. Key Relevance to the Query**  
- **Third-party claims due to breach**: The clause ensures that if a third party sues because one party breached its obligations (e.g., false warranties or non-compliance), the breaching party (Indemnifying Party) bears the costs.  
- **Procedural safeguards**: Section 7.3 (omitted here but referenced) likely outlines notice and cooperation requirements, ensuring timely handling of claims.  
- **Liability limitations**: While the parties waive most claims for indirect damages between themselves, third-party claims (even for consequential losses) **remain indemnifiable**.

### **Conclusion**  
This clause directly responds to the query by:  
1. **Requiring indemnification** for third-party claims tied to breaches of the agreement (e.g., misrepresentations, regulatory failures).  
2. **Preserving liability** for third-party judgments, even if they include consequential damages.  
3. **Shielding the non-breaching party** from bearing costs caused by the other party’s breaches.  

It balances risk allocation by ensuring third-party claims are covered while limiting direct liability between the parties.",5
indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The **Limitation of Liability** clause (Section 13.4) is relevant to the query on **indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement** in the following ways:

1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages for Direct Claims Between Parties**  
   - The clause generally limits liability between the contracting parties, excluding recovery for **special, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits) **unless** they arise from:  
     - A breach of confidentiality (Section 11), or  
     - A **third-party claim** (where such damages are awarded to a third party).  

2. **Preservation of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
   - The clause explicitly states that it does **not limit a party’s indemnification obligations** under the agreement.  
   - If a third party sues one party due to the other party’s breach (e.g., breach of contract or confidentiality), the breaching party may still be required to **indemnify** the non-breaching party for:  
     - **Damages awarded to the third party** (even if they are consequential, punitive, etc.), or  
     - **Costs incurred in defending the claim**.  

3. **Exception for Third-Party Awards**  
   - The carve-out at the end clarifies that if a third party successfully claims **special/consequential/punitive damages** against a party, those damages **may still be recoverable** from the breaching party under indemnification, even though such damages would not be recoverable in a direct dispute between the contracting parties.  

### Key Takeaway for the Query  
This clause **shields parties from liability for certain damages in their direct disputes** but ensures that **indemnification obligations remain intact for third-party claims**, including those arising from a breach of the agreement. Thus, if a third party sues due to a breach (e.g., misrepresentation, confidentiality violation, or other contractual failure), the breaching party could still be liable for the full scope of damages awarded to the third party, even if those damages would otherwise be excluded under the limitation of liability.

Here’s the relevance:

### **1. Coverage of Trademark and Copyright Infringement**  
- **Section 4.01 (Patent Infringement)** broadly covers indemnification for **patent, copyright, or proprietary right** infringement claims related to the Products.  
  - *Relevance to Query*: Explicitly includes **copyright infringement** under the indemnity obligation. The Company agrees to defend and indemnify the Distributor and its customers against such claims.  
  - *Limitation*: Only applies to infringement arising from the **Product itself** (e.g., if the Product incorporates copyrighted material without authorization).  

- **Section 4.02 (Trademark Infringement)** specifically addresses the **Snotarator™ mark** and requires the Distributor to indemnify the Company for misuse of the trademark.  
  - *Relevance to Query*: Covers **trademark infringement** but shifts liability to the **Distributor** (not the Company) if the Distributor negligently or improperly uses the mark.  
  - *Key Point*: Unlike Section 4.01 (where the Company indemnifies the Distributor), here the **Distributor indemnifies the Company** for trademark-related claims.  

### **2. Key Differences in Scope**  
- **Company’s Indemnity (4.01)**: Covers **copyright** (and patent) claims related to the Product’s design/functionality.  
- **Distributor’s Indemnity (4.02)**: Covers **trademark** claims arising from the Distributor’s misuse of the mark.  

### **3. Omissions/Gaps**  
- The clause does **not** explicitly cover **third-party trademark infringement claims** (e.g., if the Distributor uses a mark that infringes a third party’s rights, unless tied to Snotarator™).  
- **General indemnity (Section 9.03)** does not mention IP—it focuses on acts of the Distributor, termination consequences, and third-party liens.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clauses **partially satisfy** the query:  
- **Copyright infringement** is covered under **Section 4.01** (Company indemnifies Distributor).  
- **Trademark infringement** is addressed in **Section 4.02**, but only for the **Snotarator™ mark** (Distributor indemnifies Company).  
- **Gaps**: No broad trademark indemnity from the Company, and no explicit coverage for third-party copyright claims unrelated to the Product.  

For full protection, the contract might need:  
1. A **reciprocal trademark indemnity** (Company protecting Distributor).  
2. Clarification on **third-party copyright claims** beyond Product-related issues.

(a) promptly notifies Google;
(b) provides Google with reasonable information, assistance and cooperation in responding to and, where applicable, defending such IP Claim; and
(c) gives Google full control and sole authority over the defence and settlement of such IP Claim. Distributor may appoint its own supervising counsel of its choice at its own expense.
10.2 Google will not have any obligations or liability under this Clause 10 in relation to any IP Claim arising from:

10.6 The foregoing Clauses 10.1 to 10.5 states the parties' entire liability and exclusive remedy with respect to infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property Rights.","This indemnity clause is highly relevant to the query about **IP infringement coverage for trademarks or copyrights** because it explicitly outlines Google's and the Distributor's obligations regarding third-party claims of intellectual property (IP) infringement, including **trademarks and copyrights**. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Coverage of Trademark and Copyright Infringement (Clause 10.1)**  
- Google agrees to indemnify the Distributor against third-party claims alleging that:  
  - **Google’s Products** infringe a third party’s **copyright, trademark, or trade secret**.  
  - **Google’s Trademarks** infringe a third party’s **trademark or copyright**.  
- This directly addresses the query by providing protection for both **trademark and copyright** infringement claims related to Google’s intellectual property.

### **2. Exclusions Where Indemnity Does Not Apply (Clause 10.2)**  
Google’s indemnity does **not** cover claims arising from:  
- **Modification** of Google’s Products/Trademarks.  
- **Misuse** (use outside the agreement terms).  
- **Third-party content** (e.g., data provided by the Distributor or end users).  
This clarifies the **limits** of Google’s indemnification for IP claims.

### **3. Distributor’s Indemnity Obligations (Clause 10.4)**  
The Distributor must indemnify Google for:  
- Claims that the **Distributor’s own apps** infringe third-party **copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets**.  
- Improper distribution/marketing of Google’s Products.  
This ensures **reciprocal protection** for Google against IP claims caused by the Distributor.

### **4. Procedural Requirements for Indemnification (Clauses 10.1 & 10.5)**  
Both parties must:  
- **Promptly notify** the indemnifying party of a claim.  
- Provide **reasonable assistance** in defense.  
- Grant **control over legal defense and settlement**.  
These conditions ensure proper handling of IP disputes.

10.6 The foregoing Clauses 10.1 to 10.5 states the parties' entire liability and exclusive remedy with respect to infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property Rights.","This indemnity clause is directly relevant to the query about **IP infringement indemnity covering trademark or copyright**, as it outlines Google's and the Distributor's mutual obligations regarding third-party claims of intellectual property (IP) infringement, including **trademarks and copyrights**. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification for Trademark/Copyright (Clause 10.1)**  
- Google agrees to indemnify the Distributor against third-party claims alleging that:  
  - **Google’s Products** infringe a third party’s **copyright, trademark, or trade secret** (explicitly listed).  
  - **Google’s Trademarks** infringe a third party’s rights.  
- This covers the core concern of the query by addressing **trademark and copyright infringement risks** arising from the use of Google’s IP.  

### **2. Exclusions (Clause 10.2)**  
Google’s indemnity does not apply if the infringement claim arises from:  
- **Modification** of Products/Trademarks or **unauthorized combinations** with non-Google materials.  
- **Misuse** of Products/Trademarks (violating the agreement).  
- **Distributor-provided content** (e.g., Distributor’s own apps/data).  
This clarifies the limits of Google’s liability, emphasizing that the Distributor bears responsibility for its own actions or modifications.  

### **3. Distributor’s Indemnity to Google (Clause 10.4)**  
The Distributor must indemnify Google for:  
- Claims that the **Distributor’s App(s)** infringe third-party **copyright, trademark, or trade secret**.  
- Improper distribution/marketing of Google’s Products.  
This ensures reciprocal protection for Google against the Distributor’s potential IP violations.  

### **4. Procedural Requirements (Clauses 10.1 & 10.5)**  
Both parties must:  
- **Promptly notify** the indemnifying party of claims.  
- **Cooperate** and cede **control over defense/settlement**.  
These conditions ensure orderly handling of IP disputes.  

### **5. Remedies (Clause 10.3 & 10.6)**  
- Google may **suspend or modify** infringing Products/Trademarks.  
- The clause is the **exclusive remedy** for IP infringement claims, barring other legal avenues.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause comprehensively addresses the query by:  
1. **Covering trademark/copyright infringement claims** against Google’s Products/Trademarks.  
2. **Allocating liability** between Google and the Distributor based on who caused the infringement.  
3. **Detailing procedures** for handling claims.  

It balances protection for both parties while excluding indemnity for misuse or third-party content, making it a robust IP indemnity framework.  

**Key Takeaway:** If a third party sues the Distributor for trademark/copyright infringement due to Google’s Products/Trademarks, Google will defend and cover costs—provided the Distributor follows the clause’s requirements. Conversely, the Distributor must protect Google if its own actions (e.g., its apps) trigger IP claims.",5
IP infringement indemnity that covers trademark or copyright,b7896bb998,"To the extent that such IPRs do not vest automatically in the Company by operation of law, you hereby assign and agree to assign to the Company all of your right, title and interest in any existing and future IPRs which may subsist in any Works for their full term of protection (including any extensions, revivals and renewals) together with the right to sue and claim remedies for past infringement and all materials embodying these rights to the fullest extent permitted by law in any and all countries of the world.","The provided clause is relevant to the query regarding **IP infringement indemnity covering trademark or copyright** in the following ways:

### **1. Assignment of IP Rights**  
The clause ensures that all **existing and future intellectual property rights (IPRs)**—which include **trademarks and copyrights**—are assigned to the Company if they do not automatically vest in it by law. This means:  
   - If an employee or contractor creates a **trademarkable logo** or **copyrightable work**, ownership transfers to the Company.  
   - The Company gains the right to enforce these rights against third-party infringements.  

### **2. Coverage of Past and Future Infringements**  
The clause explicitly includes:  
   - **""Right to sue and claim remedies for past infringement""** → This means the Company can pursue legal action for any prior unauthorized use of the IP (e.g., if someone copied a trademarked logo before the assignment).  
   - **""Future IPRs""** → Ensures that any new trademarks or copyrights created later are also covered.  

### **3. Global Protection**  
The assignment applies **""in any and all countries of the world""**, meaning the Company can enforce its rights internationally, which is crucial for trademark and copyright protection across jurisdictions.  

### **4. Indemnity Implications**  
While this clause does not explicitly state **indemnification** (i.e., reimbursement for legal costs due to infringement claims), it strengthens the Company’s position by:  
   - Ensuring it **owns the IP**, reducing risks of third-party claims.  
   - Allowing it to **directly sue infringers**, rather than relying on the original creator.  

### **How It Relates to the Query**  
- If the query seeks **indemnity against third-party IP infringement claims**, this clause helps by securing ownership, making enforcement easier.  
- However, a separate **indemnification clause** (e.g., where the assignor promises to cover legal costs if their work infringes others’ rights) would typically be needed for full protection.  

### **Suggested Enhancement**  
To explicitly address **indemnity**, the clause could be supplemented with:  
> *""You agree to indemnify the Company against any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from any breach of third-party IPRs in the Works.""*

IP infringement indemnity that covers trademark or copyright,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","This clause is relevant to the query about **IP infringement indemnity covering trademark or copyright** in the following ways:

1. **Exclusion of IP Infringement Liability** – The clause explicitly **excludes** liability for claims arising from third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement, which includes **trademarks and copyrights**. This means that if a third party sues for trademark or copyright infringement, the clause does **not** shield the parties from liability—meaning they could still be held responsible.  

2. **No Indemnity Provided** – The clause does **not** create an affirmative obligation to indemnify (i.e., compensate or defend) the other party against IP infringement claims. Instead, it clarifies that general liability limitations (e.g., no liability for indirect or consequential damages) **do not apply** to IP infringement claims.  

3. **Implications for Trademark/Copyright Risks** – Since IP infringement is carved out from the broader liability limitations, the parties would need a **separate indemnity clause** to address who bears responsibility for trademark/copyright infringement claims. Without such a clause, the default legal rules (e.g., the infringing party being liable) would apply.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause **does not provide indemnity** for IP infringement (including trademark/copyright) but instead confirms that standard liability exclusions **do not protect** against such claims. If full protection is desired, a separate **IP indemnification clause** should be included.

As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The query asks whether the indemnification clause covers **indirect claims**. Based on the provided clause, here’s the relevance and analysis:

### **1. Definition of Indemnified Claims**  
The clause broadly defines an **""Indemnified Claim""** as any claim that one party (Indemnifying Party) must defend and indemnify the other (Indemnified Party) for. The scope includes:  
- **Direct claims** (e.g., third-party lawsuits for personal injury, property damage, or infringement).  
- **Indirect claims** (e.g., fines, penalties, or sanctions imposed by a governmental authority due to the other party’s violation of law).  

### **2. Coverage of Indirect Claims**  
The clause **explicitly includes indirect claims** in the following ways:  
- **Subsection (b)(4) & (c)(4)**: These provisions cover **governmental fines, penalties, or sanctions** imposed on one party due to the other party’s violation of law. These are **indirect consequences** of a breach or misconduct, not direct third-party lawsuits.  
- **Subsection (a)(2)**: Indemnification includes **satisfying judgments, awards, or sanctions**, which could arise from indirect liabilities (e.g., regulatory penalties stemming from a product defect).  

### **3. Broad Language Supporting Indirect Claims**  
The clause uses expansive language:  
- **""Without limitation""** (Subsection (a)) ensures that indemnification is not restricted to direct claims.  
- **""Other loss""** (Subsections (b)(1)-(2) & (c)(1)-(2)) could encompass consequential or indirect damages.  
- **""Any other matter""** (Subsections (b)(5) & (c)(5)) allows for additional indemnifiable claims, potentially including indirect liabilities.  

### **4. Conclusion**  
The indemnification clause **does cover indirect claims**, particularly:  
- Regulatory fines/penalties (explicitly listed).  
- Consequential losses tied to breaches or misconduct (implied by broad wording).  
- Other sanctions or liabilities flowing from an indemnifiable event.  

However, the clause does **not** explicitly mention certain indirect claims like **lost profits or reputational harm**, which may require further negotiation if intended to be covered.

indemnification covers indirect claims,32762b4bf5,"ARTICLE 9 - INDEMNIFICATION
Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;
(4) If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, with a reservation of all rights to seek indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party; provided, that Indemnitee may enter into a settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the indemnifying party, if the terms of such settlement (i) include only money damages as a remedy, (ii) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on the indemnifying party's business and (iii) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by the indemnifying party; and
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The query asks whether the indemnification clause covers **indirect claims**. The provided clause (Article 9) explicitly addresses this issue in **Section 9.1(a)** by stating that indemnification applies to losses arising from claims:  
> **""to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged... breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.""**  

### Key Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Explicit Coverage of Indirect Claims**:  
   - The phrase **""directly or indirectly""** makes it clear that indemnification extends not only to direct consequences of the indemnifying party's actions (e.g., a third party suing for breach of contract) but also to **indirect consequences** (e.g., downstream losses or claims stemming from the breach, such as a subcontractor’s claim arising from the indemnifying party’s negligence).  

2. **Scope of Covered Losses**:  
   - The clause covers **""any and all loss""** (including attorneys' fees, damages, or liability) tied to third-party claims, whether the indemnified party is directly sued or faces liability indirectly (e.g., as a non-party to a proceeding).  

3. **Examples of Indirect Claims**:  
   - If Party A’s negligence causes Party B’s property damage, and Party B’s customer sues Party B for resulting delays, Party A must indemnify Party B for the customer’s claim—even though the claim is an **indirect** result of Party A’s conduct.  

4. **Limitation**:  
   - The indemnification is still subject to applicable law (e.g., some jurisdictions may not enforce indemnification for gross negligence or willful misconduct).  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **explicitly includes indirect claims** within the scope of indemnification, provided they arise from the indemnifying party’s breach, negligence, or misconduct. The language ensures broad protection for the indemnified party against both direct and cascading liabilities.",5
indemnification covers indirect claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The query asks whether the indemnification clause covers **indirect claims**. The provided clause in **Section 10** is relevant because it broadly covers **""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses""** arising from breaches of warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements under the contract.  

### Key Points Supporting Coverage of Indirect Claims:  
1. **Broad Scope of Covered Claims** – The clause does not limit indemnification to **direct claims** only. The phrase **""arising out of or connected with""** suggests that **indirect claims** (e.g., consequential damages, third-party claims, or downstream liabilities) could be included if they relate to a breach of the agreement.  

2. **Inclusion of ""Losses and Expenses""** – The clause explicitly covers **""costs, losses, and expenses""**, which often encompass indirect consequences of a breach (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or legal fees from third-party suits).  

3. **No Explicit Exclusion of Indirect Claims** – Since the clause does not restrict indemnification to **direct damages only**, courts may interpret it to include **indirect claims** unless the contract elsewhere limits liability (e.g., through a separate exclusion clause).  

### Potential Limitations:  
- If the contract elsewhere excludes **consequential damages** or **indirect losses**, that could narrow the scope.  
- The phrase **""reasonably related to that claim""** might be used to argue that only **proximate (direct) damages** are covered, but this depends on jurisdiction and judicial interpretation.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause is **likely broad enough to cover indirect claims** unless contradicted by other provisions. For absolute clarity, parties often specify whether indemnification includes **consequential, incidental, or indirect damages** explicitly.

PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement.

The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The query asks whether the indemnification clause covers **indirect claims**. The provided clause outlines the indemnification obligations between **VS** and **PPD** for **Third Party Claims** (claims brought by a third party) arising from negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement.  

### Relevance to Indirect Claims:  
1. **Scope of Covered Claims** – The clause covers ""any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities"" resulting from Third Party Claims. While it does not explicitly mention ""indirect claims,"" the broad phrasing (""any and all"") could be interpreted to include **consequential, incidental, or indirect damages** unless expressly excluded elsewhere in the agreement.  

2. **Third-Party Claims Requirement** – The indemnification applies only to claims brought by **third parties**, not direct disputes between VS and PPD. If an indirect claim (e.g., a downstream customer suing PPD due to VS's negligence) qualifies as a Third Party Claim, it would likely be covered.  

3. **Limitations by Causation** – The indemnification is triggered only if the third-party claim arises from:  
   - Negligence,  
   - Intentional misconduct, or  
   - Breach of the agreement.  
   Indirect claims (e.g., lost profits or reputational harm) would only be covered if they stem from one of these specified causes.  

4. **Notice & Defense Control** – The indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party promptly, and the indemnifying party controls the defense. This suggests that even indirect liabilities (e.g., legal fees from a third-party suit) are included, provided they meet the clause’s criteria.  

### Key Consideration:  
If the parties intended to **exclude indirect claims** (e.g., consequential damages), the agreement should explicitly state so in a **limitation of liability** clause. Since this indemnification clause does not carve out indirect claims, they may be covered **if they arise from a qualifying Third Party Claim**.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Limitation to Direct Costs**: The clause explicitly states that claims, losses, costs, or expenses covered under indemnification are limited to ""actual and direct costs."" This means only tangible, immediate losses directly resulting from the event triggering indemnification are recoverable.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: The clause further clarifies that no party will be responsible for ""indirect, special, or consequential damages."" This explicitly excludes indirect claims (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or downstream business impacts) from indemnification.

3. **Relevance to the Query**: The query asks whether indemnification covers indirect claims. The clause answers this by clearly excluding such claims—only direct, actual costs are covered, while indirect damages are categorically barred.

### Key Takeaway:
The clause **does not** allow indemnification for indirect claims. It restricts coverage to direct costs and expressly disclaims liability for indirect, special, or consequential damages.

Here’s the relevance and key distinctions:

### 1. **Scope of Indemnification (Third-Party Claims Only)**  
   - The clause defines **""Claim""** as claims brought by **third parties** (non-affiliates, including governmental authorities).  
   - **Section 7.2** obligates the Indemnifying Party to defend/indemnify the other Party **only for third-party claims** arising from:  
     - Operations/content of the Indemnifying Party’s site (e.g., IP infringement, regulatory violations).  
     - Breach of representations/warranties (**Section 7.1**) or Company’s regulatory obligations (**Section 4.4**).  

   → **First-party claims** (direct disputes between the Parties) are **not covered** under this indemnity clause.  

### 2. **Exclusion of First-Party Liability**  
   - **Section 8.2** explicitly limits liability for **consequential damages** between the Parties, except in two scenarios:  
     1. **Indemnifiable third-party claims** (where damages are awarded to a third party and indemnification applies under **Section 7.2**).  
     2. **Breach of confidentiality** (**Section 11.4**).  
   - This reinforces that **first-party claims** (e.g., disputes over contract performance) are **not subject to indemnification** unless they involve third-party judgments or confidentiality breaches.  

### 3. **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
   - The clause **does not address indemnification for first-party claims** (e.g., one Party suing the other directly).  
   - It focuses on **shifting liability for third-party claims** (e.g., lawsuits from customers, regulators, or IP owners).  
   - First-party disputes would likely be governed by other provisions (e.g., dispute resolution, limitations of liability in **Section 8.2**).  

### Practical Implications  
If the query seeks protection for **first-party claims**, this clause is **not directly relevant**. The Parties would need:  
- A separate **first-party indemnity** or **liquidated damages provision** (like the exception for ACSI in **Section 8.2**).  
- Reliance on general liability exclusions or dispute resolution mechanisms elsewhere in the agreement.

Subject to Section 7.3 [Procedure], the Indemnifying Party will pay any award against the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors or representatives) and any costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by them resulting from any such Claim.","This indemnification clause is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of first-party claims""** because it defines the scope of indemnification obligations between the parties, particularly addressing claims brought by third parties (not affiliates) against the other party. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Definition of ""Claim""**  
   - The clause explicitly defines a ""Claim"" as a claim, action, or proceeding brought by a **third party** (excluding affiliates). This means the indemnification obligations here are **not for first-party claims** (i.e., disputes directly between the two contracting parties).  
   - If the query is about **first-party claims** (e.g., one party suing the other for breach of contract), this clause does **not** apply, as it is limited to third-party claims.

2. **Indemnification Scope**  
   - The Indemnifying Party must defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against third-party claims arising from:  
     - The Indemnifying Party’s site operations/content (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
     - Product sales/marketing on the Indemnifying Party’s site (with exceptions).  
     - Breaches of the Indemnifying Party’s representations/warranties or regulatory obligations.  
     - IP infringement by materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  
   - Again, this applies only to **third-party claims**, not disputes between the two parties.

3. **Exclusion of First-Party Claims**  
   - The clause is silent on indemnification for first-party claims (e.g., one party’s direct claim against the other for breach of contract). Such claims would typically be governed by other dispute resolution or liability clauses in the agreement.  
   - If the query seeks to address first-party claims, a separate clause would be needed, as this one is strictly for third-party liabilities.

### Conclusion:  
This clause is **not directly relevant** to indemnification for first-party claims, as it exclusively covers third-party claims. For first-party disputes, the contract would need a separate provision outlining indemnification, liability, or dispute resolution mechanisms between the parties themselves.  

If the intent is to address first-party claims, the clause would need to be revised to include language such as:  
*""Each Party agrees to indemnify the other for any losses arising from breaches of this Agreement by the Indemnifying Party.""*

Indemnification of first party claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The query concerns **""Indemnification of first party claims,""** which refers to situations where one party (the **indemnifying party**) agrees to compensate or protect the other party (the **indemnified party**) against losses arising from claims made by the **indemnifying party itself** or related to its own actions or breaches.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   - The clause states that each party must indemnify the other for claims **""arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements""** made by the indemnifying party.  
   - This includes **first-party claims** (i.e., claims stemming from the indemnifying party’s own breaches or misrepresentations).  

2. **Coverage of First-Party Claims**  
   - If the first party (indemnifying party) makes a claim or takes an action that contradicts its obligations under the agreement (e.g., falsely asserting compliance with a warranty), the other party can seek indemnification for resulting losses.  
   - Example: If Party A sues Party B based on a misrepresentation Party A made in the contract, Party B can invoke this clause to recover legal costs and damages.  

3. **Withholding Rights as Protection**  
   - The clause allows the non-indemnifying party to **withhold payments** (in an amount reasonably tied to the claim) pending resolution.  
   - This acts as a safeguard against first-party claims by ensuring funds are available to cover potential liabilities.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This indemnification clause is directly relevant to **first-party claims** because it obligates each party to compensate the other for losses caused by their own breaches, misrepresentations, or inconsistent actions. It also provides a mechanism (payment withholding) to mitigate risk while disputes are resolved.

The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The query asks about **""indemnification of first party claims,""** but the provided clause specifically addresses **indemnification for third-party claims** (referred to as ""Third Party Claims""). Here’s the relevance and key distinctions:

### 1. **Scope of the Clause**  
The clause outlines indemnification obligations between **VS** (indemnifying party) and **PPD** (indemnified party), but **only for claims brought by third parties** (e.g., customers, regulators, or other external entities). It does not cover disputes or claims directly between the two parties (first-party claims).  

### 2. **Key Elements of the Clause**  
   - **Trigger**: Indemnification applies only to third-party claims arising from:  
     - Negligence,  
     - Intentional misconduct, or  
     - Breach of the agreement by either party.  
   - **Process**:  
     - Prompt notice by the indemnified party.  
     - Control of defense/settlement by the indemnifying party (unless they fail to act).  
     - Right of the indemnified party to participate (at their own expense unless exceptions apply).  

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause **does not address first-party claims** (e.g., if PPD sues VS directly for breach of contract). For first-party disputes, other contract terms (e.g., liability limitations, dispute resolution, or direct warranties) would apply.  

### 4. **Suggested Next Steps**  
If the query seeks coverage for **first-party claims**, the contract would need:  
   - A separate clause addressing direct liabilities between the parties.  
   - Clarification on whether indemnification applies to disputes between VS and PPD (unlike this clause, which is strictly third-party-focused).  

**Conclusion**: The clause is **not directly relevant** to first-party claims but is a robust framework for third-party indemnification. To address the query, the contract would require additional provisions.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Relevance to First-Party Claims:
1. **Definition of ""Claim""**:  
   - The clause defines a ""Claim"" as a claim, action, or proceeding brought by a **third party** (excluding affiliates of either party). This means it does **not** cover first-party claims (i.e., direct claims between the two parties to the agreement).  
   - If the query is about indemnification for first-party claims (e.g., breach of contract between the parties), this clause **does not apply**, as it is limited to third-party claims.

2. **Indemnification Scope**:  
   - The Indemnifying Party must defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against third-party claims arising from:  
     - The Indemnifying Party’s site operations/content (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
     - The Indemnifying Party’s product sales/marketing (with exceptions).  
     - Breach of the Indemnifying Party’s representations/warranties or regulatory obligations.  
     - Infringement of intellectual property rights by the Indemnifying Party’s materials.  
   - Again, this applies only to **third-party claims**, not disputes between the two parties.

3. **Exclusion of First-Party Claims**:  
   - The clause explicitly ties indemnification to third-party claims, so **first-party claims** (e.g., one party suing the other for breach of contract) would need to be addressed elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., in a liability or dispute resolution clause).  

### If the Query Intended ""Third-Party Claims"":
If the query mistakenly referred to ""first-party"" but meant third-party claims, this clause is central because:  
- It outlines **what types of third-party claims** trigger indemnification.  
- It clarifies **which party bears responsibility** (e.g., for IP infringement, site content, or regulatory violations).  
- It requires the Indemnifying Party to cover legal costs, damages, and awards related to such claims.  

### Conclusion:
For **first-party claims**, this clause does not apply, and the agreement would need separate provisions. For **third-party claims**, it comprehensively allocates indemnification responsibilities. If the query’s focus was indeed first-party claims, the user should review other sections of the contract (e.g., liability limitations, warranties, or dispute resolution).

indemnification clauses that include hold harmless,317052cc02,"G. INDEMNIFICATION
The respective parties shall indemnify and hold one another harmless as follows:
1. MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any MICOA act or omission, except to the extent the Agency has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.
2. Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless""**—a common pairing in contracts where one party agrees to compensate (indemnify) the other for losses/damages while also shielding them (holding them harmless) from liability.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Structure**  
   - The clause explicitly combines **indemnification** (""shall indemnify"") with **hold harmless** (""hold ... harmless""), directly addressing the query’s focus.  

2. **Reciprocal Obligations**  
   - Both parties (MICOA and Agency) mutually agree to:  
     - **Indemnify**: Cover costs (e.g., legal fees, damages) arising from their own acts/omissions.  
     - **Hold Harmless**: Prevent the other party from being held liable for those acts/omissions.  

3. **Exceptions**  
   - The clause limits indemnification if the other party contributed to the error (e.g., Agency won’t be indemnified if it caused part of the harm). This is a standard risk-allocation feature.  

4. **Key Terminology**  
   - The phrase **""indemnify and hold harmless""** is used verbatim, demonstrating how the two concepts are linked in practice.  

### **Why It Matters**  
This clause is a textbook example of how contracts use ""indemnify and hold harmless"" to:  
- Allocate financial responsibility.  
- Protect parties from third-party claims.  
- Clarify liability boundaries (via exceptions).

indemnification clauses that include hold harmless,3aed540ab1,"(a) Indemnification. Each Party (""Indemnifying Party"") shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the other Party (""Indemnified Party"") and its officers, directors, agents, employees, and affiliates, from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, costs, expenses, liabilities, judgments, causes of action, proceedings, suits, losses and damages of any nature, which are threatened or brought against, or are suffered or incurred by, the Indemnified Party or any such person to the extent caused directly by acts or omissions of the Indemnifying Party relating to this Agreement, including without limitation (i) any negligent or tortious conduct, (ii) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or conditions of the Indemnifying Party contained in this Agreement, (iii) any violation of applicable laws or regulations, (iv) infringement or violation of any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary interest of any third party, and (v) any breach of any express or implied warranties relating to the Products, including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnification clauses that include hold harmless""** because it explicitly combines both **indemnification** and **hold harmless** obligations in a single provision. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **Indemnification + Hold Harmless Language**  
   - The clause begins with the phrase *""shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend""*, which clearly incorporates both concepts.  
     - **Indemnify**: The Indemnifying Party agrees to compensate the Indemnified Party for losses/damages.  
     - **Hold Harmless**: The Indemnifying Party assumes liability and agrees to prevent the Indemnified Party from suffering financial or legal harm.  
   - This dual protection is a hallmark of robust indemnification clauses, ensuring the Indemnified Party is shielded from both actual losses and potential claims.

### 2. **Scope of Coverage**  
   The clause broadly covers:  
   - **Parties Protected**: The Indemnified Party, its officers, directors, agents, employees, and affiliates.  
   - **Types of Claims**: Explicitly lists claims, demands, lawsuits, costs, and damages arising from the Indemnifying Party’s acts/omissions.  
   - **Specific Triggers**: Includes negligence, breaches of contract, legal violations, IP infringement, and warranty breaches.  

### 3. **Key Features Matching the Query**  
   - **""Hold Harmless"" as a Distinct Obligation**: The clause goes beyond mere reimbursement (indemnification) by requiring the Indemnifying Party to actively prevent the Indemnified Party from bearing any liability (hold harmless).  
   - **Defense Obligation**: The inclusion of *""defend""* further strengthens the clause by requiring the Indemnifying Party to handle legal defense costs.  
   - **Comprehensive Coverage**: The enumerated categories (e.g., torts, breaches, IP issues) ensure the hold harmless provision applies to diverse risks.  

### 4. **Practical Relevance**  
   - This clause is a **strong example** of how indemnification and hold harmless provisions are interlinked in contracts to provide maximum protection.  
   - It addresses the query by demonstrating how ""hold harmless"" language is integrated into indemnification clauses to expand liability assumption beyond mere compensation.  

### Conclusion  
The clause directly responds to the query by illustrating a **combined indemnification and hold harmless provision** with clear scope, triggers, and protections. It shows how such clauses are drafted to allocate risk comprehensively between parties.

indemnification clauses that include hold harmless,ca78a8476d,"The foregoing indemnities shall expressly exclude any liability for consequential, punitive, special or similar damages, including, without limitation, lost profits.","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless""** provisions. The provided clause is a **limitation** within an indemnification clause, but it does not explicitly contain the term ""hold harmless."" However, its relevance can be explained as follows:

### **1. Connection to Indemnification & Hold Harmless**  
- **Indemnification clauses** typically require one party (the indemnitor) to compensate the other (the indemnitee) for losses arising from certain claims (e.g., third-party lawsuits, breaches of contract).  
- **""Hold harmless""** is a related concept where the indemnitor agrees not only to compensate but also to **shield the indemnitee from liability** (i.e., preventing the indemnitee from being held responsible for certain claims).  

While the clause does not use the phrase ""hold harmless,"" it **functions as a carve-out within an indemnification framework**, limiting the scope of damages that can be claimed under indemnity.

### **2. Relevance of the Clause to the Query**  
The clause **excludes certain types of damages** (consequential, punitive, special, lost profits) from indemnification. This means:  
- Even if the broader indemnification clause includes a ""hold harmless"" obligation, **this exclusion prevents the indemnitee from being protected against these specific damages**.  
- It clarifies that the indemnitor **will not be liable** for indirect or excessive damages, even if they otherwise agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the other party.  

### **3. Practical Implications**  
- If the indemnification clause includes a **""hold harmless""** provision, this exclusion ensures that the indemnitor’s obligation does not extend to **consequential or punitive damages**.  
- This is a **risk-allocation mechanism**, protecting the indemnitor from excessive liability while still covering direct losses (e.g., third-party claims for direct damages).  

### **Conclusion**  
While the clause does not explicitly mention ""hold harmless,"" it **modifies an indemnification obligation** by excluding certain damages. If the broader agreement includes a hold harmless provision, this clause **limits its scope**, making it relevant to the query.

12.1 Each Party (""Indemnitor"") will defend, indemnify and hold the other Party (including associated officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and affiliates) (cumulatively, ""Indemnitee"") harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees), suffered or incurred as a result of or in connection with any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding brought against Indemnitee based upon (a) a claim of a failure to perform, or a breach by Indemnitor of, any obligation, warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; (b) a claim of personal injury or property damage arising out of the fault or negligence of Indemnitor, its representatives, agents, or employees; or (c) a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right held by any third party.
12.2 EXCEPTING ONLY CLAIMS MADE PURSUANT TO SECTION 12.1, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES OR LOST SAVINGS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED, KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW, OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless""** because it explicitly combines both concepts in a comprehensive manner. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **Indemnification with ""Hold Harmless"" Language**  
   - The clause uses the phrase **""defend, indemnify, and hold harmless""**, which is a standard formulation in indemnification clauses.  
   - **""Hold harmless""** means the Indemnitor (the party providing indemnity) agrees to protect the Indemnitee (the other party) from losses, damages, or liabilities arising from specified claims.  
   - The clause ensures that the Indemnitee is not only compensated for losses (**indemnification**) but also shielded from legal exposure (**hold harmless**).

### 2. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   The clause covers three key scenarios where indemnification applies:  
   - **(a) Breach of Agreement**: Failure to perform obligations under the contract.  
   - **(b) Negligence or Fault**: Personal injury or property damage caused by the Indemnitor.  
   - **(c) IP Infringement**: Claims of patent, trademark, or copyright violations.  

   This broad coverage ensures that the Indemnitee is protected from a wide range of risks.

### 3. **Exclusions (Limitation of Liability)**  
   - Section **12.2** carves out exceptions, stating that **neither party is liable for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits) unless they fall under the indemnifiable claims in **12.1**.  
   - This reinforces that the **""hold harmless""** protection is limited to the specified risks, not open-ended.

### **Why This Clause Fits the Query**  
- It is a **classic example** of an indemnification clause that includes **""hold harmless""** language.  
- It clearly defines **who is protected** (Indemnitee), **what risks are covered**, and **what is excluded**.  
- The **defense obligation** (""defend"") is also included, which is often part of such clauses.  

### **Key Takeaways for Drafting Similar Clauses**  
1. Use **""indemnify and hold harmless""** together for maximum protection.  
2. Define **specific triggers** (breach, negligence, IP claims) to avoid ambiguity.

<omitted>
ARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless""** provisions. Here’s how the provided clause is relevant:

### Key Points:
1. **Indemnification Clauses (Sections 11.1 and 11.2)**  
   - While the specific text of Sections 11.1 (Indemnification by Xencor) and 11.2 (Indemnification by Aimmune) is omitted, indemnification clauses typically require one party to compensate the other for losses, damages, or liabilities arising from specified claims (e.g., third-party claims).  
   - A **""hold harmless""** provision is often included in indemnification clauses, meaning the indemnifying party agrees not only to reimburse the other party but also to **shield them from liability entirely**. The phrase ""indemnify, defend, and hold harmless"" is common in such clauses.  

2. **Explicit Link to Indemnification Rights (Section 11.4)**  
   - Section 11.4 (Limitation of Liability) carves out an exception for indemnification obligations under Sections 11.1 and 11.2. It states that the limitation on damages (e.g., no liability for lost profits) **does not restrict indemnification rights or obligations**.  
   - This confirms that the indemnification clauses (likely including ""hold harmless"" language) operate independently and are **not limited by the general liability cap**.  

3. **Confidentiality Exception**  
   - The clause also clarifies that damages for breaches of confidentiality (Article 12) are not limited by Section 11.4. This reinforces that indemnification and confidentiality obligations are treated as **separate and broader protections** than the general liability limitations.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause demonstrates how indemnification provisions (Sections 11.1/11.2) are **prioritized over liability limitations**, which is typical in agreements where ""hold harmless"" protections are included.  
- While the exact wording of ""hold harmless"" is not visible in the excerpt, the structure suggests that Sections 11.1 and 11.2 likely contain such language, as they are explicitly exempted from liability restrictions.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is relevant because it highlights the **interplay between indemnification (potentially including ""hold harmless"") and liability limitations**, ensuring that indemnification obligations remain enforceable despite broader exclusions of damages. For full confirmation, the omitted text of Sections 11.1 and 11.2 would need to be reviewed for explicit ""hold harmless"" language.",4
indemnification clauses that do not include hold harmless,317052cc02,"G. INDEMNIFICATION
The respective parties shall indemnify and hold one another harmless as follows:
1. MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any MICOA act or omission, except to the extent the Agency has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.
2. Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that do not include ""hold harmless""**, but the provided clause explicitly **includes both ""indemnify"" and ""hold harmless""** language.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **""Hold Harmless"" is Present** – The clause states:  
   - *""indemnify and hold one another harmless""* (general statement)  
   - *""indemnify and hold Agency harmless""* (specific obligations)  

   This means the clause **does not** match the query's focus on indemnification **without** hold harmless provisions.  

2. **Key Difference Between Indemnification & Hold Harmless**  
   - **Indemnification** = Reimbursement for losses/liabilities.  
   - **Hold Harmless** = Agreement not to sue or seek damages from the other party.  
   Here, both concepts are combined, which is common in contracts but not what the query seeks.  

### Suggested Revision for a ""No Hold Harmless"" Clause:  
If the goal is **indemnification-only**, the clause could be rewritten as:  
> *""MICOA shall indemnify Agency for losses arising from MICOA’s acts or omissions, except to the extent Agency contributed to such losses.""*  

This removes ""hold harmless"" while preserving indemnification.

Here’s the relevance to the query:  

1. **Clause Structure vs. Query**  
   - The clause combines **indemnification**, **hold harmless**, and **defense obligations** in a single provision.  
   - The query seeks clauses *without* ""hold harmless,"" so this example does **not** match the request.  

2. **Key Differences Between Indemnification and Hold Harmless**  
   - **Indemnification**: Reimbursement for losses/damages incurred.  
   - **Hold Harmless**: Agreement to prevent the indemnified party from being held liable (shifts legal responsibility).  
   - Here, the clause includes both, broadening protection for the Indemnified Party.  

3. **Why This Matters for the Query**  
   - If the goal is to find indemnification-only clauses, this example is **not** suitable.  
   - To align with the query, the clause would need to **omit ""hold harmless""** (e.g., *""shall indemnify and defend…""*).  

### Suggested Revision for Query Compliance  
To exclude ""hold harmless,"" the clause could be rewritten as:  
> *""Each Party shall indemnify and defend the other Party… from and against any and all claims…""*

indemnification clauses that do not include hold harmless,ca78a8476d,"The foregoing indemnities shall expressly exclude any liability for consequential, punitive, special or similar damages, including, without limitation, lost profits.","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that do not include ""hold harmless""** language. The provided clause is an example of an indemnification provision that **limits the scope of indemnifiable damages** but does **not** explicitly include a ""hold harmless"" obligation. Here’s why this is relevant:

### Key Observations:
1. **No ""Hold Harmless"" Language**:  
   - A traditional indemnification clause often includes both **indemnify** and **hold harmless** (e.g., ""Party A shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Party B..."").  
   - The clause here only references **indemnities** (compensation for losses) and does not mention ""hold harmless,"" which typically protects against third-party claims or legal actions.  

2. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for **consequential, punitive, special, or similar damages** (e.g., lost profits).  
   - This narrows the indemnification obligation to **direct damages only**, further limiting the indemnitor’s exposure.  

3. **Implications for the Query**:  
   - The clause aligns with the query because it demonstrates an indemnification provision that **does not incorporate ""hold harmless""** while still defining the scope of indemnifiable losses.  
   - Without ""hold harmless,"" the indemnitor may not be obligated to **defend** the indemnitee against claims or absorb liabilities beyond direct compensation.  

### Why This Matters:
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause shifts less risk to the indemnitor by excluding broad protections (like ""hold harmless"") and certain damages.  
- **Legal Precision**: Drafters may intentionally omit ""hold harmless"" to avoid broader obligations, especially in jurisdictions where the terms ""indemnify"" and ""hold harmless"" are interpreted differently.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a clear example of an **indemnification-only provision** (no ""hold harmless"") with explicit carve-outs for indirect damages. It responds to the query by showing how indemnification can be tailored narrowly without extending to broader protections.

12.1 Each Party (""Indemnitor"") will defend, indemnify and hold the other Party (including associated officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and affiliates) (cumulatively, ""Indemnitee"") harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees), suffered or incurred as a result of or in connection with any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding brought against Indemnitee based upon (a) a claim of a failure to perform, or a breach by Indemnitor of, any obligation, warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; (b) a claim of personal injury or property damage arising out of the fault or negligence of Indemnitor, its representatives, agents, or employees; or (c) a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right held by any third party.

### Analysis of the Provided Clause:  
The clause **does include ""hold harmless""** (Section 12.1 states: *""defend, indemnify and hold the other Party... harmless""*). Therefore, it does **not** match the query's request for clauses **without** ""hold harmless"" language.  

### Key Observations:  
1. **""Hold Harmless"" is Explicitly Included**  
   - The phrase *""indemnify and hold harmless""* is standard in comprehensive indemnification clauses, as it ensures the indemnitor covers both **compensation** (indemnify) and **legal protection** (hold harmless).  

2. **Distinction from Pure Indemnification**  
   - A clause **without** ""hold harmless"" might only require reimbursement for losses (e.g., ""Party A will indemnify Party B for damages"") but would not obligate Party A to **defend** Party B against third-party claims or prevent Party B from being held liable.  

3. **Why This Clause Doesn’t Fit the Query**  
   - The clause goes beyond mere indemnification by including defense obligations (*""defend""*) and liability shielding (*""hold harmless""*). It is a **broader protection** than what the query seeks.  

### Example of a Clause **Without** ""Hold Harmless"":  
If Section 12.1 were revised to exclude ""hold harmless,"" it might read:  
> *""Each Party will indemnify the other Party against any losses arising from breaches of this Agreement...""*  

Such a version would align with the query by limiting the obligation to **financial compensation** only.  

### Conclusion:  
The provided clause is **not relevant** to the query because it explicitly includes ""hold harmless."" For clauses omitting this language, you’d need to remove *""hold harmless""* (and potentially *""defend""*) to focus solely on reimbursement.

<omitted>
ARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that do not include ""hold harmless""** language. Here’s how the provided clause is relevant to this query:

### Key Observations:
1. **Indemnification Without ""Hold Harmless""**  
   - The indemnification clauses in **Sections 11.1 (Xencor)** and **11.2 (Aimmune)** are omitted, but the structure suggests they are standalone indemnification obligations.  
   - Critically, the clause does **not** explicitly use the phrase ""hold harmless,"" which is often paired with ""indemnify"" in broader indemnification provisions.  
   - The absence of ""hold harmless"" implies the clause may focus solely on **compensation for losses/damages** (indemnification) rather than also shielding the indemnified party from liability to third parties (hold harmless).

2. **Limitation of Liability (Section 11.4)**  
   - While this section excludes liability for certain damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential damages), it **carves out an exception for indemnification obligations** under Sections 11.1 and 11.2.  
   - This reinforces that indemnification rights/obligations are treated separately and are **not limited by the general liability cap**, but it does not expand them to include ""hold harmless"" protections.  

3. **Confidentiality Exception**  
   - The clause also preserves damages for breaches of confidentiality (Article 12), but this is unrelated to indemnification or hold harmless language.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause demonstrates a common contractual approach where:  
- **Indemnification is addressed separately** (Sections 11.1/11.2) without merging it with ""hold harmless"" language.  
- The **limitation of liability** explicitly excludes indemnification from its scope, but the indemnification provisions themselves (if reviewed in full) would need to confirm whether they are purely compensatory or include broader protections.  

### Conclusion:  
Based on the visible text, this agreement likely contains **indemnification clauses without ""hold harmless"" language**, as the term is absent in the provided sections, and the focus is on liability limitations/exceptions rather than third-party liability shielding. To fully confirm, the omitted text of Sections 11.1 and 11.2 would need review.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Elements Addressing ""Indemnification Clauses That Include Defending Claims"":
1. **Explicit Duty to Defend**  
   The clause states that the Indemnitor (the party providing indemnification) must **""defend, indemnify, and hold harmless""** the Indemnitee. The inclusion of ""defend"" means the Indemnitor is obligated to take active steps (e.g., hiring legal counsel, managing litigation) to address third-party claims, not just reimburse costs after the fact.

2. **Scope of Covered Claims**  
   The clause specifies the types of claims triggering the defense/indemnity obligation, including:  
   - Breach of contract (Section 12.1(a))  
   - Negligence or fault causing injury/damage (12.1(b))  
   - Intellectual property infringement (12.1(c))  

3. **Hold Harmless and Coverage**  
   The Indemnitor must cover not only damages but also **legal fees and expenses** tied to defending claims, ensuring the Indemnitee is fully protected from the financial burden of litigation.

4. **Carve-Out for Indirect Damages**  
   Section 12.2 clarifies that the duty to defend/indemnify does not extend to indirect or consequential damages (e.g., lost profits), except for claims falling under 12.1. This limits liability but preserves the defense obligation for the core scenarios listed.

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause explicitly integrates **defense obligations** into indemnification, which is a critical distinction. Many indemnity clauses only cover reimbursement, but here, the Indemnitor must actively **manage the legal defense**, providing broader protection. This is a strong example of a clause that combines both indemnity and defense duties.

In addition, Depomed will defend, at its own expense, indemnify and hold harmless King and its Affiliates from and against any and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of any Third Party claim, suit or proceeding brought against King or its Affiliates to the extent such claim, suit, or proceeding is based upon a claim arising out of or relating to (w) any actions of the Depomed Sales Force, including any false or misleading representations to Professionals, customers or others regarding King or the Product; (x) any agreement between Depomed and BLS; or (y) any claim made by any Person that the manufacture, use or sale of the Product infringes or misappropriates the patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of such Person, except with respect to any claim relating to the King Trademarks; and (z) any product liability claim made by any Person with respect to the Product, except to the extent liability is based on a breach by King of Section 4.2. Each party agrees that it shall promptly notify the other in writing of any such claim or action and give the indemnifying party full information and assistance in connection therewith. The indemnifying party shall have the sole right to control the defense and the sole right to settle or compromise any such claim or action, except that the prior written consent of the other party shall be required in connection with any settlement or compromise which could (i) place any obligation on or require any action of such other party; (ii) admit or imply any liability or wrongdoing of such other party; or (iii) adversely affect the goodwill or public image of such other party.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Features Addressing the Query:
1. **Duty to Defend**  
   - The clause explicitly states that each party will **""defend, at its own expense""** claims covered by the indemnification obligations. This goes beyond mere reimbursement (indemnification) and imposes an active obligation to handle the legal defense of claims.  
   - Example: *""Each party will defend, at its own expense, indemnify and hold harmless the other party...""*  

2. **Scope of Covered Claims**  
   - The clause specifies the types of claims triggering the duty to defend and indemnify, including:  
     - Breach of covenants, warranties, or agreements (e.g., Sections (i) and (ii)).  
     - Negligence or willful misconduct (Section (iii)).  
     - Product liability, IP infringement, and sales force actions (Sections (w)–(z), specific to Depomed).  

3. **Procedural Requirements**  
   - **Notice and Cooperation**: The indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party promptly and provide assistance (though the indemnifying party controls the defense).  
   - **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party has sole control over the defense and settlement, subject to limitations (e.g., no admission of liability without consent).  
   - **Right to Participate**: The indemnified party may hire its own counsel, but at its own expense.  

4. **Survival Period**  
   - The clause survives termination for **three years** (or longer for claims notified before expiration), ensuring ongoing protection for latent claims.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The query focuses on indemnification clauses that **include defending claims**, and this clause is a robust example because:  
- It **combines indemnification and defense obligations** in one provision.  
- It details **how the defense will be managed** (control, settlement rights, cooperation).  
- It covers **common scenarios** (e.g., IP infringement, product liability) where defense costs are critical.  

### Potential Considerations:  
- **Asymmetry**: Depomed has broader indemnification duties (e.g., product liability, IP claims) compared to King.  
- **Limitations**: The indemnifying party’s settlement rights are restricted (e.g., no admission of liability without consent).  

In summary, this clause is a **comprehensive response** to the query, as it integrates defense obligations into indemnification while addressing procedural, substantive, and temporal aspects of claims.

Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;
(4) If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, with a reservation of all rights to seek indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party; provided, that Indemnitee may enter into a settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the indemnifying party, if the terms of such settlement (i) include only money damages as a remedy, (ii) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on the indemnifying party's business and (iii) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by the indemnifying party; and
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","This indemnification clause is highly relevant to the query about clauses that include **defending claims** because it explicitly addresses both **indemnification** and the **defense of claims** in a detailed and structured manner. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects Addressing ""Defending Claims"":
1. **Duty to Defend**:  
   - The clause obligates the indemnifying party to **defend** claims (Section 9.1(b)(1)), not just indemnify for losses. This is a critical distinction, as some indemnification clauses only cover reimbursement after a loss is incurred.  
   - The indemnifying party may elect to ""defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense.""

2. **Procedures for Defense**:  
   - **Timely Response**: The indemnifying party must notify the Indemnitee within 30 days of receiving a Claims Notice if it intends to defend (Section 9.1(b)(2)).  
   - **Cooperation**: The Indemnitee must cooperate in the defense (e.g., providing documents) at the indemnifying party’s expense.  
   - **Counsel Selection**: The indemnifying party must select counsel ""reasonably acceptable"" to the Indemnitee, ensuring the defense aligns with the Indemnitee’s interests.  

3. **Settlement Control**:  
   - The indemnifying party cannot settle without the Indemnitee’s consent (unless specific conditions are met, such as no admission of wrongdoing or material obligations on the Indemnitee) (Section 9.1(b)(3)). This protects the Indemnitee from unfavorable settlements.  
   - If the indemnifying party refuses to defend, the Indemnitee can take over the defense and later seek reimbursement (Section 9.1(b)(4)).  

4. **Shared Participation**:  
   - Both parties may participate in the defense at their own expense (Section 9.1(b)(5)), allowing the Indemnitee to monitor or influence the defense even if the indemnifying party leads it.  

### Relevance to Query:  
The clause goes beyond simple reimbursement by:  
- Clearly outlining **who controls the defense** (indemnifying party).  
- Setting **procedural requirements** (notice, cooperation, counsel approval).  
- Balancing **settlement authority** to protect both parties.  
- Addressing scenarios where the indemnifying party **fails to act**.  

This ensures that defending third-party claims is as central to the clause as financial indemnification, making it a robust example of an indemnification clause that includes defense obligations.

Defense and indemnification under this Section will include, without limitation, (1) paying or reimbursing the actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement of any civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, arbitration, mediation, hearing, audit, investigation or other proceeding threatened or commenced against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim (e.g., fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants, auditors, investigators, consulting experts, testifying experts and other consultants; fees and expenses of an arbitrator or mediator; filing fees and costs imposed by any court, administrative agency or other tribunal; etc.), and (2) satisfying any judgment, award, order, lien, levy, fine, penalty or other sanction imposed against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim. b. Seller will defend and indemnify Buyer against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Seller, including, without limitation, any product supplied by Seller which fails to conform to the representations and warranties in this Agreement; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Seller in the design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery of any product sold by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Seller under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, packaging, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement (except to the extent that the infringement is based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license terms in supplying the product); (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by a governmental authority on Buyer to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Seller of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Seller has agreed to defend and indemnify Buyer against under a Purchase Schedule. c. Buyer will defend and indemnify Seller against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Buyer; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Buyer in the purchase, storage, repackaging, resale or delivery of any product purchased from Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Buyer under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement to the extent based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license term in supplying the product; (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by governmental authority on Seller to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Buyer of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Buyer has agreed to defend and indemnify Seller against under a Purchase Schedule. d. As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","This indemnification clause is highly relevant to the query about clauses that include **defending claims** because it explicitly addresses both the duty to **indemnify** (compensate for losses) and the duty to **defend** (handle legal proceedings) against third-party claims. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects Addressing ""Defending Claims"":
1. **Explicit Duty to Defend**:  
   - The clause repeatedly uses the phrase **""defend and indemnify""**, making clear that the Indemnifying Party’s obligations include both legal defense and financial compensation.  
   - Subsection (a) defines an ""Indemnified Claim"" as one the Indemnifying Party must **defend** (not just pay for), and lists expenses like attorney fees, court costs, and expert witness fees tied to defense efforts.

2. **Scope of Defense Obligations**:  
   - Subsections (b) and (c) specify scenarios where Seller/Buyer must defend the other Party against third-party claims (e.g., personal injury, infringement, regulatory penalties).  
   - Examples include claims arising from negligence, breaches of the agreement, or intellectual property disputes.

3. **Procedural Requirements for Defense**:  
   - **Tender of Defense**: Subsection (d) requires the Indemnified Party to formally notify and ""tender"" the claim to the Indemnifying Party, triggering the defense obligation.  
   - **Control of Defense**: Subsection (e) grants the Indemnifying Party control over the defense (e.g., selecting attorneys, deciding settlement strategy), provided they act in good faith.  
   - **Cooperation**: The Indemnified Party must assist in the defense (e.g., providing information), with costs reimbursed.

4. **Settlement Mechanisms**:  
   - Subsection (f) allows the Indemnifying Party to settle IP claims through specific actions (e.g., obtaining licenses, modifying products), emphasizing proactive defense resolution.  

5. **Conflict Resolution**:  
   - Subsection (g) addresses disputes over defense responsibilities, including scenarios where separate counsel is needed due to conflicts of interest, ensuring clarity on defense duties.

### Why It Matches the Query:  
The clause goes beyond simple reimbursement by embedding **defense obligations** into the indemnification framework. It details:  
- **Who defends** (Indemnifying Party),  
- **What triggers defense** (specific claim types),  
- **How defense is managed** (tender, control, cooperation), and  
- **Resolution pathways** (settlement, conflict handling).  

This comprehensive approach ensures that ""defending claims"" is not just mentioned but operationalized with clear procedures and responsibilities.",5
indemnification clauses that include defending claims,a1f2e7f3dd,"12. Indemnification. VS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PPD, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any claim, action or proceeding by a third party (a ""Third Party Claim"") arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","This indemnification clause is highly relevant to the query because it explicitly includes the duty to **defend claims** as part of the indemnification obligations. Here’s how it addresses the key aspects of the query:

1. **Indemnification with Defense Obligation**  
   - Both parties (VS and PPD) agree not only to **indemnify** (compensate for losses) but also to **defend** the other party against third-party claims arising from negligence, misconduct, or breach of the agreement.  
   - The clause specifies that the indemnifying party must cover legal costs, including ""reasonable attorney's fees and court costs,"" which are typical in defense scenarios.

2. **Control of Defense**  
   - The indemnifying party has the **right to control the defense and settlement** of the claim, ensuring they can manage the legal strategy.  
   - Conditions are attached (e.g., acting ""reasonably and in good faith"") to prevent abuse of this control.

3. **Notice and Cooperation**  
   - The indemnified party must provide **prompt notice** of the claim, enabling the indemnifying party to initiate defense efforts.  
   - The indemnified party must **cooperate** in the defense but retains the right to **participate** (though not control) at its own expense.

4. **Fallback Protections**  
   - If the indemnifying party fails to defend the claim, the indemnified party can **take over the defense** (with costs borne by the indemnifying party).  
   - The indemnified party may also hire separate counsel at its own expense unless the indemnifying party approves or neglects its duty.

### Relevance Summary  
This clause directly aligns with the query by:  
- Combining **indemnification** with an explicit **defense obligation**.  
- Detailing **procedures for defense control**, cooperation, and cost allocation.  
- Addressing scenarios where the indemnifying party fails to act, ensuring the indemnified party is protected.  

It is a robust example of a clause where indemnification includes defending claims, with clear mechanics for implementation.",5
indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,c3e38c985d,"11. Indemnification: Each Party agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, its officers, directors, employees, volunteers, subcontractors and agents, from any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, or settlements, including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses incurred on account of the their respective negligent acts or omissions, and those of their directors, employees, agents, contractors and sub- contractors, in connection with this Agreement.","The query asks for an **indemnification clause that allows the indemnifying party to control defenses**. The provided clause partially addresses this but lacks explicit language granting the indemnifying party the right to **control the defense** of claims. Here’s the relevance and gaps:

### **Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Duty to Defend**:  
   The clause states that each party agrees to **""defend""** the other, which implies an obligation to handle legal defenses. This aligns with the query’s requirement that the indemnifying party should manage defenses.

2. **Indemnification Scope**:  
   It covers claims arising from negligence, including legal fees, which is consistent with typical indemnification clauses where the indemnifying party bears the costs of defense.

### **Missing Elements for Full Control of Defenses:**
1. **Explicit Control Language**:  
   The clause does **not** explicitly state that the indemnifying party has the **exclusive right to select counsel, direct litigation strategy, or settle claims**. A stronger clause would clarify this, e.g.:  
   *""The indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to control the defense and settlement of any claim, subject to the indemnified Party’s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld).""*

2. **Cooperation Requirements**:  
   There is no mention of the indemnified party’s duty to cooperate (e.g., providing notice, assistance) or restrictions on admitting liability, which are common in defense-controlled clauses.

3. **Survival or Limitations**:  
   The clause lacks details on whether the duty to defend survives termination or is subject to caps/exclusions, which could affect control.

### **Suggested Improvement:**  
To fully meet the query’s intent, the clause could be revised to:  
> *""The indemnifying Party shall, at its sole expense, defend the indemnified Party against any claim covered by this indemnity, using counsel of its choice, and shall have exclusive authority to direct and settle such defense, provided that no settlement may admit liability on behalf of the indemnified Party without its prior written consent.""*

### **Conclusion:**  
The current clause implies a duty to defend but does not **explicitly grant control** over defenses. For full alignment with the query, explicit language about the indemnifying party’s authority to manage claims is needed.",3
indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,988610fe80,"Section 9.1 Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX, each Party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the ""Indemnified Parties"") from and against all Losses imposed upon or incurred by an Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of or resulting from the Indemnifying Party's or its Affiliates' material breach of this Agreement, except to the extent that such Losses are primarily caused by the Indemnified Party.","The query asks for an **indemnification clause that allows the indemnifying party to control defenses**. The provided clause (Section 9.1) partially addresses this but does not explicitly grant the indemnifying party the right to **control the defense** of claims. Here’s the relevance and potential gaps:

### **Key Elements of the Clause:**
1. **Indemnification Obligation**  
   - The Indemnifying Party must **indemnify, defend, and hold harmless** the Indemnified Parties for covered losses (e.g., breaches of the agreement).  
   - The phrase **""defend and hold harmless""** implies an obligation to handle legal defenses, but it does not clearly state whether the Indemnifying Party has **exclusive control** over the defense strategy.

2. **Limitations**  
   - The indemnification is subject to the agreement’s limitations (e.g., losses not primarily caused by the Indemnified Party).  
   - However, there is no explicit language about **who selects counsel, directs litigation, or settles claims**.

### **Relevance to the Query:**
- The clause **implies** a duty to defend (via ""defend and hold harmless""), but it does not **expressly** grant the Indemnifying Party the right to **control the defense**.  
- For full compliance with the query, the clause should explicitly state that the Indemnifying Party has the **right to assume and control the defense**, including:  
   - Selecting legal counsel.  
   - Making strategic decisions.  
   - Settling claims (subject to certain conditions).  

### **Suggested Improvement:**
To fully align with the query, the clause could be amended to include language such as:  
> *""The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to assume and control the defense of any claim for which indemnification is sought, using counsel of its choice. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in such defense at the Indemnifying Party’s expense.""*  

### **Conclusion:**  
The current clause **supports indemnification and defense** but does not **explicitly grant control** to the Indemnifying Party. To meet the query’s requirement, an express right to control defenses should be added.

indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,b961c3c348,"7. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party (the ""Indemnified Party"") from and against any and all claims, damages, and liabilities, including any and all expense and costs, legal or otherwise, caused by the negligent act or omission of the Indemnifying Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees, incurred by the Indemnified Party in the investigation and defense of any claim, demand, or action arising out of the work performed under this Agreement; including breach of the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claims, damages, or liabilities caused by the sole negligence of the Indemnified Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees. The Indemnified Party shall notify promptly the Indemnifying Party of the existence of any claim, demand, or other matter to which the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations would apply, and shall give them a reasonable opportunity to settle or defend the same at their own expense and with counsel of their own selection, provided that the Indemnified Party shall at all times also have the right to fully participate in the defense. If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after this notice, fails to take appropriate steps to settle or defend the claim, demand, or the matter, the Indemnified Party shall, upon written notice, have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake such settlement or defense and to compromise or settle the claim, demand, or other matter on behalf, for the account, and at the risk, of the Indemnifying Party. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Article shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, and heirs of the Parties.","This indemnification clause is highly relevant to the query regarding an **""indemnification clause that allows the indemnifying party to control defenses""** because it explicitly grants the Indemnifying Party the right to manage the defense of claims, subject to certain conditions. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Provisions Addressing Control of Defenses:
1. **Right to Settle or Defend**:  
   - The clause states that the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party of a claim, and the Indemnifying Party then has the **right to ""settle or defend the same at their own expense and with counsel of their own selection.""**  
   - This grants the Indemnifying Party primary control over the defense strategy, including choice of legal counsel and decisions on settlement.

2. **Conditional Participation by Indemnified Party**:  
   - While the Indemnifying Party controls the defense, the Indemnified Party retains the right to **""fully participate in the defense""** (e.g., observing, providing input, or joining proceedings). However, this does not override the Indemnifying Party’s authority to lead the defense.

3. **Fallback to Indemnified Party if Indemnifying Party Fails to Act**:  
   - If the Indemnifying Party does not take action within a ""reasonable time,"" the Indemnified Party may step in to settle or defend the claim **on behalf of the Indemnifying Party**.  
   - This ensures the Indemnifying Party’s control is not absolute; it is contingent on their prompt engagement.

### Why This Meets the Query’s Requirement:
- The clause strikes a balance: it **prioritizes the Indemnifying Party’s control** over defenses (aligned with the query) while safeguarding the Indemnified Party’s interests through participation rights and a fallback mechanism.  
- It avoids a scenario where the Indemnified Party unilaterally dictates the defense, which could expose the Indemnifying Party to unreasonable costs or unfavorable resolutions.

### Additional Notes:
- **Limitation of Liability**: The Indemnifying Party is not liable for claims caused by the **sole negligence** of the Indemnified Party, which further defines the scope of their control.  
- **Procedural Safeguards**: The requirement for prompt notice and ""reasonable opportunity"" to defend ensures the Indemnifying Party’s control is exercised fairly.

In summary, this clause explicitly addresses the query by embedding the Indemnifying Party’s **right to control defenses** while incorporating checks to protect both parties.",5
indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,0b4bc1e424,"10. INDEMNIFICATION 10.1 Indemnification.

The provided clause partially addresses this but does not explicitly grant full control over defenses to the indemnifying party. Here’s the relevance and potential gaps:

### **Key Elements Related to the Query:**
1. **Indemnification Obligation**  
   - The clause requires the Indemnifying Party to **""indemnify, defend, and hold harmless""** the Indemnified Parties.  
   - The term **""defend""** implies that the Indemnifying Party has the **right to assume control of the defense** against claims covered by the indemnity.  

2. **Scope of Control**  
   - While the clause obligates the Indemnifying Party to defend, it does **not explicitly state** whether the Indemnified Party retains any rights (e.g., to approve settlements or appoint its own counsel at the Indemnifying Party’s expense).  
   - A more detailed clause might specify:  
     - Whether the Indemnifying Party has **exclusive control** over the defense.  
     - Conditions under which the Indemnified Party can **participate** (e.g., with separate counsel).  
     - Whether the Indemnifying Party can **settle claims without consent** (unless settlement imposes liability on the Indemnified Party).  

### **Suggested Improvements for Clarity on Defense Control:**  
To fully align with the query, the clause could be revised to explicitly state:  
   - **""The Indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to control the defense of any claim, including the selection of legal counsel and settlement negotiations, provided that no settlement may impose liability or obligations on the Indemnified Party without its prior written consent.""**  

### **Conclusion:**  
The current clause **implies** defense control through the ""defend"" obligation but lacks explicit terms granting full authority. For stronger alignment with the query, it should clarify the extent of the Indemnifying Party’s control and any limitations.

the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement.","The query asks for an **indemnification clause that allows the indemnifying party to control defenses**. The provided clause (Section 10.1) partially addresses this but lacks explicit language granting the **indemnifying party the right to assume and control the defense** of claims. Here’s the relevance and gaps:

### **Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Indemnification Obligation Includes Defense**:  
   - The clause states the indemnifying party must **""defend""** (not just indemnify) the indemnified parties, implying some control over legal proceedings.  
   - However, it does not explicitly state whether the indemnifying party has the **exclusive right to select counsel, direct litigation, or settle claims**, which is key to ""controlling defenses.""

     - Breach of the agreement (10.1(a))  
     - Gross negligence or willful misconduct (10.1(b)).  
   - This aligns with typical indemnity scenarios where the at-fault party controls the defense.

### **Missing Elements for Full Control:**  
To fully meet the query’s requirement, the clause should clarify:  
   - **Right to Assume Defense**: Explicitly grant the indemnifying party the right to take over the defense of claims (e.g., ""The Indemnifying Party may, at its sole option, assume control of the defense"").  
   - **Settlement Authority**: Specify whether the indemnifying party can settle claims without the indemnified party’s consent (often subject to reasonableness).  
   - **Cooperation Requirements**: Obligate the indemnified party to cooperate with the defense (e.g., providing information).  

### **Suggested Improvement:**  
To align with the query, add language like:

The Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in such defense at the Indemnifying Party’s reasonable request.""*  

### **Conclusion:**  
The current clause implies a duty to defend but does not **expressly** grant control over defenses. To fully address the query, it should be amended to clarify the indemnifying party’s procedural rights.

Indemnity of broad-based claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The query concerns **""indemnity of broad-based claims,""** which generally refers to indemnification obligations covering a wide range of potential claims, liabilities, or losses. The provided **Section 10 (Indemnification)** is highly relevant to this query because it establishes a **broad indemnification obligation** between the parties. Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause Relevant to Broad-Based Claims:
1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   - The clause requires each party to indemnify the other for **""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses""** arising from breaches of warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements in the contract.  
   - This language is intentionally **broad**, covering not just direct claims but also associated legal costs (e.g., attorneys' fees), making it applicable to a wide range of disputes.

2. **Trigger for Indemnification**  
   - The indemnity applies to claims **""arising out of or connected with""** any inconsistency with the indemnifying party’s contractual promises.  
   - This broad phrasing ensures that even **indirect or consequential claims** (e.g., third-party lawsuits, regulatory actions) tied to a breach are covered.

3. **Withholding Rights for Pending Claims**  
   - The non-indemnifying party may **withhold payments** reasonably related to the claim, including estimated legal costs.  
   - This provision reinforces the broad protection by allowing proactive financial safeguards while a claim is unresolved.

### Why This Addresses ""Broad-Based Claims"":
- The clause does **not limit indemnification to specific types of claims** (e.g., only third-party claims or direct breaches). Instead, it applies to **any claim or demand** inconsistent with the agreement, ensuring wide coverage.  
- It includes **legal costs and attorneys' fees**, which are critical for broad indemnity, as disputes often involve significant litigation expenses.  
- The **withholding mechanism** further extends protection by allowing the non-breaching party to secure funds tied to potential liabilities.

### Potential Considerations:
- While broad, the clause could be clarified further (e.g., specifying whether it covers **negligence, intentional misconduct, or third-party claims**).  
- Some jurisdictions may enforce limits on overly broad indemnities, so legal review for compliance is advisable.  

### Conclusion:  
This indemnity clause is **highly relevant to broad-based claims** because it imposes a wide-ranging obligation to cover virtually any claim tied to a breach of the agreement, along with associated costs. It provides robust protection but should be reviewed for enforceability in the applicable jurisdiction.

Indemnity of broad-based claims,596576fcc8,"Section 5.04 Limitations.

Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 5.04, the limitations provided in this Section 5.04 shall not apply to (i) any claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (ii) any claim for breach of any agreement or covenant contained herein.","The clause in **Section 5.04** addresses the **limitations on indemnity for broad-based claims** by imposing certain conditions and caps on the Indemnifying Party's liability. Here’s how it relates to the query:  

### **Key Aspects of the Clause Relevant to Broad-Based Claims:**  
1. **Thresholds and Deductibles (Limitation (i))**  
   - The Indemnifying Party is **not liable** for claims until a certain threshold (e.g., aggregate losses exceeding a specified amount) is met.  
   - Once the threshold is crossed, liability is limited to **only the excess** above that threshold.  
   - This prevents the Indemnifying Party from being responsible for minor or scattered claims, focusing instead on **material losses**.  

2. **Cap on Liability (Limitation (ii))**  
   - The Indemnifying Party’s total liability for **broad-based claims** (e.g., multiple small claims or systemic issues) is **capped** at a certain amount.  
   - This protects the Indemnifying Party from **open-ended exposure** to numerous or widespread claims.  

3. **Exceptions to Limitations**  
   - The limitations **do not apply** to:  
     - **Fraud or intentional misrepresentation** (ensuring bad-faith acts are fully indemnifiable).  
     - **Breach of specific agreements/covenants** (ensuring core contractual obligations remain enforceable).  

### **Relevance to ""Indemnity of Broad-Based Claims""**  
- The clause **structures indemnity obligations** to balance risk between parties:  
  - It prevents the Indemnifying Party from facing **unlimited liability** for numerous small or dispersed claims.  
  - It ensures **material breaches or systemic issues** are still covered, but with financial safeguards.  
- The **threshold and cap mechanisms** are particularly relevant to broad-based claims, as they prevent indemnification from being triggered by trivial or frequent issues while still addressing significant aggregated losses.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **limits indemnity exposure for broad-based claims** by:  
- Requiring a **minimum threshold** before liability applies.  
- **Capping total liability** for such claims.  
- **Excluding fraud and core breaches** from these limits.  

This structure is common in contracts to **manage risk** when dealing with widespread or repetitive claims while ensuring accountability for serious misconduct.

Indemnity of broad-based claims,16553eaa2d,"20. INDEMNITY AND INSURANCE. Berkshire shall indemnify and hold Auriemma harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys', consultants' and experts' fees) (collectively, ""Claims"") arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy or breach of Berkshire's representations, warranties, covenants or any claim or other cause of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including actions based upon gross negligence of Berkshire under this Agreement, provided that Berkshire shall be given prompt notice of any such action or claim.","The query concerns **""indemnity of broad-based claims,""** which refers to the scope of protection provided by an indemnity clause against a wide range of potential legal claims. The clause you provided (Section 20) is a **broad indemnity provision** that aligns with this concept in several key ways:

### **Relevance to Broad-Based Indemnity:**
1. **Wide Coverage of Claims**  
   - The clause indemnifies Auriemma against **""any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, damages, and expenses""** arising from Berkshire’s breaches, inaccuracies, or negligence.  
   - The phrase **""arising out of or relating to""** extends indemnification to **indirect or consequential claims**, not just direct breaches.  

2. **Inclusion of Legal Costs**  
   - The indemnity explicitly covers **attorneys’ fees, consultants’ fees, and experts’ fees**, ensuring that Auriemma is protected even in complex litigation.  

3. **Gross Negligence Coverage**  
   - Many indemnity clauses exclude gross negligence, but this one **explicitly includes it**, broadening the scope of Berkshire’s liability.  

4. **Prompt Notice Requirement**  
   - The condition that Berkshire must be given **""prompt notice""** of any claim ensures that Berkshire can defend itself early, but it does not narrow the types of claims covered.  

### **Why This is a ""Broad-Based"" Indemnity Clause**  
- It does **not limit** indemnification to specific types of breaches (e.g., only breaches of warranties).  
- It covers **third-party claims** (e.g., lawsuits from outside parties related to Berkshire’s actions under the agreement).  
- It applies to **both contractual and tort-based claims** (e.g., negligence).  

### **Potential Concerns for Berkshire**  
- The clause is **one-sided** (only Berkshire indemnifies Auriemma).  
- The inclusion of **gross negligence** means Berkshire could be liable even for reckless misconduct.  
- The broad language (""**any and all claims**"") could expose Berkshire to unforeseen liabilities.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **highly relevant** to the query because it provides **broad-based indemnity**, protecting Auriemma from a wide spectrum of legal and financial risks tied to Berkshire’s obligations under the agreement. If Berkshire wanted to narrow the scope, it might seek exclusions for **ordinary negligence, third-party claims unrelated to the contract, or capped liability**.

Indemnity of broad-based claims,6a700c0c62,"EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnity of broad-based claims""** because it defines the scope and limitations of liability for damages, including those that might arise from broad-based claims (e.g., consequential, indirect, or punitive damages). Here’s how it connects to the query:

### 1. **Exclusion of Broad Liability**  
The clause explicitly excludes liability for a wide range of damages (e.g., consequential, indirect, punitive, lost profits) **unless** they arise from third-party claims covered under **Section 9** (the indemnification section). This means:  
   - **Broad-based claims** (e.g., claims for incidental or speculative damages) are generally barred.  
   - **Indemnity for third-party claims** (under Section 9) is preserved as an exception, ensuring that liability for such claims survives.  

### 2. **Indemnity Exception**  
The carve-out for **Section 9** clarifies that indemnification obligations for third-party claims (e.g., IP infringement, personal injury, or other liabilities to outsiders) are **not affected** by this limitation. Thus:  
   - The clause does **not** restrict indemnity for direct losses suffered by third parties.  
   - It only limits liability between the contracting parties for indirect or consequential losses.  

### 3. **Legal Safeguards**  
The clause reinforces its broad exclusion by stating that liability is waived **regardless of**:  
   - Foreseeability of damages.  
   - Prior notice of potential damages.  
   - The legal theory (contract, tort, etc.).  
This strengthens the enforceability of the limitation against broad-based claims.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause directly addresses how indemnity operates in the context of broad-based claims:  
- **For third-party claims**: Indemnity under Section 9 remains intact.  
- **For claims between the parties**: Most expansive damages (e.g., lost profits, punitive damages) are excluded, narrowing the scope of recoverable losses.  

In summary, it balances **protecting parties from open-ended liability** while **preserving indemnity for specific third-party risks**. This is critical for managing exposure to broad or speculative claims.

A claim that a Party (referred to at times in this Section as an ""Indemnifying Party"") is required to defend and indemnify the other Party (referred to at times in this Section as an ""Indemnified Party"") under this Agreement is referred to at times in this Section as an ""Indemnified Claim"". Defense and indemnification under this Section will include, without limitation, (1) paying or reimbursing the actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement of any civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, arbitration, mediation, hearing, audit, investigation or other proceeding threatened or commenced against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim (e.g., fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants, auditors, investigators, consulting experts, testifying experts and other consultants; fees and expenses of an arbitrator or mediator; filing fees and costs imposed by any court, administrative agency or other tribunal; etc.), and (2) satisfying any judgment, award, order, lien, levy, fine, penalty or other sanction imposed against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim. b. Seller will defend and indemnify Buyer against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Seller, including, without limitation, any product supplied by Seller which fails to conform to the representations and warranties in this Agreement; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Seller in the design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery of any product sold by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Seller under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, packaging, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement (except to the extent that the infringement is based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license terms in supplying the product); (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by a governmental authority on Buyer to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Seller of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Seller has agreed to defend and indemnify Buyer against under a Purchase Schedule. c. Buyer will defend and indemnify Seller against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Buyer; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Buyer in the purchase, storage, repackaging, resale or delivery of any product purchased from Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Buyer under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement to the extent based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license term in supplying the product; (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by governmental authority on Seller to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Buyer of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Buyer has agreed to defend and indemnify Seller against under a Purchase Schedule. d. As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The query asks about **""indemnity of broad-based claims""**, which generally refers to indemnification obligations covering a wide range of potential claims, including third-party claims, regulatory actions, intellectual property disputes, and other liabilities. The provided **Indemnification Clause (Section 7)** is highly relevant to this query because it establishes a comprehensive framework for indemnification between the parties (Seller and Buyer), addressing multiple categories of claims that could arise. Here’s how the clause aligns with the query:

### **1. Scope of Broad-Based Claims Covered**  
The clause explicitly covers a wide array of indemnifiable claims, including:  
- **Third-party claims** (e.g., personal injury, property damage, negligence, or breach of contract) (Sections 7.b.1–2, 7.c.1–2).  
- **Intellectual property infringement claims** (Sections 7.b.3, 7.c.3).  
- **Regulatory fines/penalties** imposed by governmental authorities (Sections 7.b.4, 7.c.4).  
- **Other agreed-upon matters** under a Purchase Schedule (Sections 7.b.5, 7.c.5).  

This breadth ensures that the indemnification obligations are **not narrowly limited** but instead encompass **diverse risks**, making it ""broad-based.""

### **2. Defense and Indemnification Process**  
The clause details:  
- **What is covered**: Legal fees, expert costs, settlements, judgments, and other expenses (Section 7.a).  
- **Procedural requirements**: Prompt notice, tender of defense, and cooperation (Section 7.d).  
- **Control of defense**: The Indemnifying Party manages the claim (Section 7.e).  
- **Settlement options**: For IP claims, the Indemnifying Party can resolve disputes via licensing, product modification, or withdrawal (Section 7.f).  

This structured approach ensures that **both parties understand their rights and obligations** when handling broad-based claims.

### **3. Conflict Resolution for Disputed Claims**  
If the parties disagree on:  
- Whether a claim qualifies for indemnification,  
- Which party is responsible, or  
- How liability should be allocated,  

the clause provides a **good-faith negotiation process** (Section 7.g) and allows for separate defense if conflicts persist. This flexibility is crucial for **managing complex or overlapping claims**.

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause is **highly relevant to broad-based claims** because:  
1. It **covers a wide variety of potential liabilities** (tort, contract, IP, regulatory).  
2. It **clearly defines procedures** for defense, reimbursement, and settlement.  
3. It **addresses disputes** over responsibility, ensuring enforceability.  

Thus, it serves as a **robust mechanism** for allocating risk between the parties in a manner that anticipates diverse and unpredictable claims.

Indemnified party includes affiliates,c30b9c337f,"During the term of this Agreement, Party B and its affiliates will be the exclusive cooperator of Party A's real estate and home furnishing cooperation channel. Party A grants all-round exclusive rights to Party B to construct, maintain and operate the Cooperation channel. Party B and its affiliates will be the exclusive provider of real estate and home furnishing information, products and data in Party A's real estate and home furnishing channel.","The query asks whether the **""indemnified party includes affiliates""** in the context of the provided clause. Here's how the clause is relevant to the query:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Inclusion of Affiliates**:  
   The clause explicitly mentions that **""Party B and its affiliates""** are granted exclusive rights by Party A. This indicates that affiliates of Party B are integral to the agreement and share the same rights and obligations as Party B under the contract.

2. **Scope of Rights and Obligations**:  
   The clause grants Party B and its affiliates **exclusive rights** to operate Party A's cooperation channel, including providing information, products, and data. Since affiliates are included in these rights, they are likely also covered by any indemnification provisions elsewhere in the agreement (even though indemnification is not explicitly mentioned in this clause).

3. **Implication for Indemnification**:  
   - If the agreement includes an indemnification clause (e.g., where Party A agrees to indemnify Party B for certain liabilities), the reference to **""Party B and its affiliates""** in this clause suggests that affiliates would also qualify as **""indemnified parties""** under such a provision.  
   - Conversely, if Party B is required to indemnify Party A, affiliates may also be bound by such obligations due to their inclusion in the clause.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause demonstrates that **affiliates are treated as extensions of Party B** for the purposes of rights and responsibilities under the agreement.  
- While the clause does not directly address indemnification, the inclusion of affiliates in the grant of rights implies they would likely be included in indemnification protections or liabilities unless explicitly excluded elsewhere.  

### Recommendation:
To fully confirm whether affiliates are indemnified parties, you would need to review the **specific indemnification clause** in the agreement. However, this clause supports the interpretation that affiliates are covered, as they are treated equally with Party B in terms of rights and obligations.

Indemnified party includes affiliates,988610fe80,"Section 9.1 Indemnification.

Here’s the relevance:

1. **Definition of ""Indemnified Parties""**:  
   The clause defines the **""Indemnified Parties""** broadly to include:  
   - The **other Party** (i.e., the non-breaching party to the agreement),  
   - Its **Affiliates**, and  
   - Its and their **directors, officers, employees, agents, etc.**  

   This means affiliates of the non-breaching party are expressly included as beneficiaries of the indemnification protection.

2. **Scope of Protection**:  
   The indemnification covers **Losses** arising from the Indemnifying Party’s (or its Affiliates’) **material breach of the Agreement**, unless the Losses are primarily caused by the Indemnified Party.  
   - Affiliates of the protected Party are shielded from liability stemming from the counterparty’s breach.  

3. **Alignment with Query**:  
   The clause directly addresses the query by clarifying that affiliates are **expressly included** in the definition of ""Indemnified Parties"" and are therefore entitled to indemnification under the terms outlined.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause explicitly extends indemnification rights to **affiliates of the non-breaching party**, ensuring they are protected against losses caused by the other party’s material breach. This is a common provision to safeguard corporate groups and their stakeholders.",5

Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Definition of ""Indemnified Party"" and Affiliates**  
   - Section 7.2 states that the **""Indemnified Party"" includes its Affiliates** (along with their employees, directors, and representatives).  
   - The indemnity obligation covers claims, costs, losses, etc., arising from third-party claims (as defined under ""Claim"") against both the Indemnified Party **and its Affiliates**.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   - The Indemnifying Party must defend and indemnify not only the other Party but also its Affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries or related entities) against third-party claims.  
   - This is reinforced by the phrase:  
     > *""hold harmless the other Party (the 'Indemnified Party') **and its Affiliates**... from and against any and all claims...""*  

3. **Exclusion of Affiliate Claims**  
   - The definition of ""Claim"" explicitly excludes claims brought by **Affiliates of either Party** (i.e., disputes between the Parties' own Affiliates are not covered by indemnity).  
   - This clarifies that indemnification applies only to **external third-party claims**, not internal disputes.

4. **Confirmation in Damages Clause**  
   - Section 8.2 further supports this by referencing indemnification for third-party judgments, implying Affiliates are protected under the same umbrella as the Indemnified Party.

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause **explicitly includes Affiliates** as part of the ""Indemnified Party,"" ensuring they are protected under the indemnity provisions. However, claims **between Affiliates of the Parties** are excluded from the definition of ""Claim,"" meaning the indemnity does not cover internal disputes.  

In summary:  
- **Yes**, the Indemnified Party includes its Affiliates for third-party claims.  
- **No**, Affiliates cannot bring indemnifiable claims against each other.  

This balances broad protection for external risks while limiting liability for internal conflicts.",5
Indemnified party includes affiliates,1618943a84,"Notwithstanding the foregoing, no rights, obligations or liabilities hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without prior written consent of all of the other Parties; provided, however, that a Party shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to the assignment of rights and obligations by the other Parties to its Affiliate if that Affiliate's performance has been guaranteed satisfactorily in form and substance by the assigning Party.","The query asks whether the **""indemnified party includes affiliates""** in the context of the given clause. Here’s how the clause is relevant to the query:

1. **Affiliates as Potential Assignees**:  
   The clause explicitly allows a Party to assign its rights and obligations to an **Affiliate**, provided:  
   - The other Party consents (not unreasonably withheld).  
   - The assigning Party guarantees the Affiliate’s performance.  

   This implies that **Affiliates can step into the shoes of the original Party** under the contract, including assuming rights (such as indemnification) and obligations.

2. **Indemnified Party Implications**:  
   If an Affiliate becomes an assignee under this clause, it would logically inherit the same contractual protections as the original Party, including the right to be **indemnified** (if the contract includes indemnification provisions).  
   - For example, if Party A assigns its rights to Affiliate B, and the contract entitles the ""Party"" to indemnification, Affiliate B would now qualify as the ""indemnified party"" by virtue of the assignment.  

3. **Limitation on Scope**:  
   The clause does not automatically extend rights to all Affiliates universally—only to those that are **valid assignees** under the terms (i.e., with consent and a performance guarantee). Thus, affiliates are included as indemnified parties **only if they meet these conditions**.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause supports the idea that **affiliates can be indemnified parties**, but only if they are properly assigned rights under the contract and meet the specified requirements (consent + guarantee). It does not grant blanket coverage to all affiliates unless they are formally brought into the agreement via assignment.  

If the contract has a separate definition of ""indemnified party"" that explicitly includes affiliates, this clause would further reinforce that possibility by allowing affiliates to become contractual parties through assignment.",5

   - **Section 8.2 (No Consequential Damages)** and **8.3 (Limitation of Damages)** carve out exceptions for indemnification claims under **Section 7.2**, reinforcing that the indemnity obligations (including those covering Affiliates) remain enforceable despite limitations on liability elsewhere.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **directly addresses the query** by confirming that the **Indemnified Party’s rights extend to its Affiliates**. This ensures broad protection for the Indemnified Party’s corporate group, not just the named entity in the agreement.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Definition of ""Claim""**  
   - The clause defines **""Claim""** broadly to include any third-party legal action (excluding claims by affiliates), which sets the boundary for what triggers indemnification. This ensures clarity about the types of disputes covered.

### 2. **Specified Claims Triggering Indemnification**  
   The Indemnifying Party must indemnify the other party for claims arising from:  
   - **Operation/content of their own site** (unless caused by the Indemnified Party’s requirements).  
   - **Products/services offered through their site** (with exceptions for the Indemnified Party’s products).  
   - **Breach of representations/warranties** (Section 7.1) or regulatory compliance (Section 4.4, specific to one party).  
   - **Infringement of intellectual property rights** by materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  

   These are the **""specified claims""** the query refers to—clearly enumerated scenarios where indemnification applies.

### 3. **First-Party Obligations**  
   - The clause assigns responsibility to the **first party** (the Indemnifying Party) to cover costs (e.g., legal fees, damages) incurred by the other party due to the specified claims.  
   - It clarifies that the Indemnifying Party must pay awards, costs, and attorneys’ fees resulting from such claims, reinforcing the first party’s financial liability.

### 4. **Exclusions and Limitations**  
   - **Consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) are excluded under Section 8.2, **unless** they arise from a third-party judgment covered by indemnification (Section 7.2) or a breach of confidentiality (Section 11.4). This limits the scope of indemnifiable losses.  
   - The carve-out for liquidated damages (Section 10.5.2) further refines what is/is not covered.

### 5. **Procedural Requirements**  
   - The reference to **Section 7.3 (Procedure)** implies that the Indemnified Party must follow specific steps (e.g., timely notice, cooperation) to invoke indemnification, ensuring structured enforcement.

### **Key Relevance to the Query**  
This clause directly addresses **first-party indemnification** by:  
- Defining the **indemnifying party’s obligations** for **specific claims** (third-party actions tied to their site, products, breaches, or IP infringement).  
- Explicitly **excluding certain liabilities** (e.g., consequential damages) unless tied to indemnifiable claims.  
- Providing a **framework for enforcement** (payment of awards, procedural rules).  

In summary, it is a **targeted indemnification clause** that allocates risk between parties for enumerated third-party claims while limiting exposure to broader damages.",5

Subject to Section 7.3 [Procedure], the Indemnifying Party will pay any award against the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors or representatives) and any costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by them resulting from any such Claim.","This indemnification clause is directly relevant to the query about **""first party indemnification of specified claims""** because it outlines the obligations of one party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party (the ""Indemnified Party"") against specific types of third-party claims. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Definition of ""Claim""**:  
   - The clause defines ""Claim"" broadly to include any third-party claim, action, or proceeding (excluding claims by affiliates). This sets the scope for what types of disputes trigger indemnification.

2. **Specified Claims Covered**:  
   The indemnity obligation applies only to claims arising from **four specific categories**:  
   - **(a)** The Indemnifying Party’s own site operations or content (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
   - **(b)** The marketing/sale of products/services through the Indemnifying Party’s site (with exceptions for the Indemnified Party’s products).  
   - **(c)** Breaches of the Indemnifying Party’s representations/warranties (Section 7.1) or regulatory compliance obligations (Section 4.4, if applicable).  
   - **(d)** Intellectual Property infringement claims related to materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  

   This ensures indemnification is **narrowly tailored** to specified scenarios, protecting the Indemnified Party from liabilities tied to the Indemnifying Party’s actions or failures.

3. **First-Party Obligation**:  
   - The clause explicitly binds the **""Indemnifying Party""** (the first party in this context) to cover costs (e.g., legal fees, damages, awards) incurred by the Indemnified Party due to the specified claims. This shifts liability to the party responsible for the underlying issue.

4. **Procedure & Scope**:  
   - The indemnity is subject to Section 7.3 (likely outlining notice requirements and defense control), ensuring structured handling of claims.  
   - It extends protection not just to the Indemnified Party but also to its affiliates, employees, and representatives, broadening the safeguard.

### Why It Answers the Query:
- The clause **clearly defines** which claims trigger indemnification, aligning with the query’s focus on ""specified claims.""  
- It establishes the **first party’s (Indemnifying Party’s) duty** to bear costs and liabilities, addressing the ""first party indemnification"" aspect.  
- The **exclusions and carve-outs** (e.g., for content/materials supplied by the Indemnified Party) ensure the indemnity is precise and fair.  

In summary, this clause provides a **targeted indemnification mechanism** where the first party (Indemnifying Party) assumes responsibility for enumerated third-party claims, protecting the counterparty from risks tied to the first party’s operations, content, or breaches.",5
first party indemnification of specified claims,a1f2e7f3dd,"12. Indemnification. VS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PPD, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any claim, action or proceeding by a third party (a ""Third Party Claim"") arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","This **indemnification clause** is directly relevant to the query about **""first party indemnification of specified claims""** because it outlines the obligations of both parties (VS and PPD) to indemnify each other against **specific third-party claims** arising from certain wrongful acts. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **First-Party Indemnification**:  
   - **VS** (the first party in this context) agrees to indemnify **PPD** (and its affiliates, directors, officers, and employees) for third-party claims arising from:  
     - VS’s **negligence**,  
     - VS’s **intentional misconduct**, or  
     - VS’s **breach of the agreement**.  
   - Conversely, **PPD** (another first party) agrees to indemnify **VS** (and its directors, officers, and employees) for third-party claims arising from PPD’s equivalent wrongful acts.

2. **Specified Claims Covered**:  
   - The indemnification applies only to **Third Party Claims** (claims brought by an external third party, not disputes between VS and PPD).  
   - The triggering events are narrowly defined: **negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of contract**—not all possible liabilities.  

3. **Procedural Requirements**:  
   - **Notice**: The indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party of a claim.  
   - **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party has the **right to control the defense and settlement**, ensuring they can manage costs and strategy.  
   - **Cooperation**: The indemnified party must reasonably assist in the defense.  
   - **Right to Participate**: The indemnified party may join the defense at its own expense unless the indemnifying party fails to act (in which case the indemnified party takes control).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause clearly defines **which party (first party) is responsible for indemnifying the other** based on the nature of the claim.  
- It specifies **what types of claims** (third-party claims due to negligence, misconduct, or breach) trigger indemnification.  
- It includes **conditions and limitations** (notice, defense control, cooperation) that structure how indemnification operates.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a **mutual indemnification provision** where each ""first party"" (VS or PPD) agrees to protect the other against specified third-party claims caused by their own wrongdoing. It ensures that liability is allocated fairly and procedurally managed.

Buyer will defend and indemnify Seller against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Buyer; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Buyer in the purchase, storage, repackaging, resale or delivery of any product purchased from Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Buyer under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement to the extent based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license term in supplying the product; (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by governmental authority on Seller to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Buyer of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Buyer has agreed to defend and indemnify Seller against under a Purchase Schedule. d. As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The query asks about **""first party indemnification of specified claims,""** which refers to the obligations of one party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") to defend and compensate the other party (the ""Indemnified Party"") for certain predefined claims or liabilities. The provided **Indemnification Clause (Section 7)** comprehensively addresses this by:

### **1. Defining Indemnified Claims**  
The clause specifies that an ""Indemnified Claim"" arises when one party is required to defend and indemnify the other under the agreement. It outlines the scope of indemnification, including:  
- Reimbursement of legal and related expenses (e.g., attorney fees, court costs).  
- Payment of judgments, fines, or penalties imposed on the Indemnified Party.  

### **2. Specifying Claims Covered by Each Party**  
The clause **explicitly lists the types of claims** for which each party (Seller or Buyer) must indemnify the other:  

#### **Seller’s Indemnification Obligations (First Party = Seller)**  
Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer for:  
- Third-party claims for **personal injury, property damage, or loss** caused by Seller’s breach, negligence, or misconduct.  
- **Infringement claims** related to Seller’s products (unless caused by Buyer’s licensed IP).  
- **Fines/penalties** imposed due to Seller’s violation of law.  
- Any additional indemnification agreed in a Purchase Schedule.  

#### **Buyer’s Indemnification Obligations (First Party = Buyer)**  
Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller for:  
- Third-party claims for **personal injury, property damage, or loss** caused by Buyer’s breach, negligence, or misconduct.  
- **Infringement claims** to the extent they arise from Buyer’s licensed IP.  
- **Fines/penalties** imposed due to Buyer’s violation of law.  
- Any additional indemnification agreed in a Purchase Schedule.  

### **3. Conditions for Indemnification**  
The clause imposes **procedural requirements** on the Indemnified Party to qualify for indemnification:  
- **Prompt notice** of the claim to the Indemnifying Party.  
- **Cooperation** with the Indemnifying Party’s defense efforts.  

### **4. Control of Defense & Settlement**  
The Indemnifying Party has the **right to control** the defense and settlement of claims, subject to good faith obligations. It also allows for **specific remedies in IP infringement cases** (e.g., obtaining licenses, modifying products).  

### **5. Dispute Resolution for Conflicting Claims**  
If parties disagree on liability, they must attempt to resolve conflicts in good faith. If unresolved, each may defend separately and later seek reimbursement.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
This clause **directly answers the query** by:  
- Identifying which party (first party = Seller or Buyer) must indemnify the other.  
- Enumerating the **specific claims** triggering indemnification.  
- Detailing the **process and limitations** for enforcing indemnification rights.  

Thus, it provides a **clear, structured framework** for indemnification obligations between the parties, ensuring predictability and risk allocation.",5
first party indemnification of specified claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The **""first party indemnification of specified claims""** refers to one party's obligation to compensate and protect the other party from certain legal claims, losses, or liabilities as outlined in the contract.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **Indemnification Scope** – The clause specifies that **each party (including the ""first party"")** must indemnify the other for claims arising from breaches of warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements made in the contract. This directly addresses the query by defining the types of claims subject to indemnification.  

2. **Covered Claims** – The indemnification applies to **""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses""** (including legal fees) tied to a breach of contractual obligations. This ensures that the indemnified party is protected from financial harm due to the indemnifying party’s misrepresentations or failures.  

3. **Withholding Right** – The clause allows the non-indemnifying party to **withhold payments** related to a disputed claim until resolution, protecting them from potential losses while the claim is pending. This is a practical enforcement mechanism for indemnification.  

4. **Mutual Obligation** – While the query focuses on ""first party"" indemnification, the clause is **reciprocal**, meaning both parties have the same indemnification duties. However, it can be tailored if only one party (e.g., the ""first party"") is required to indemnify the other.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
This clause is highly relevant because it:  
- Defines **what claims are indemnifiable** (those contradicting contractual promises).  
- Specifies **financial protections** (covering legal costs, damages, etc.).  
- Provides a **risk-mitigation tool** (payment withholding) for pending claims.  

If the query seeks a **one-sided indemnity** (only the first party indemnifying), the clause would need modification to remove reciprocity. Otherwise, it broadly aligns with the concept of indemnifying specified claims.

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 8.2 [No Consequential Damages] IS INTENDED TO LIMIT ANY RIGHT OF ACSI TO RECEIVE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.5.2 [Effect of Termination].","This indemnification clause is highly relevant to the query about **""first-party indemnification of broad-based claims""** because it outlines the scope, conditions, and limitations under which one party (the **Indemnifying Party**) must defend and indemnify the other party (the **Indemnified Party**) against third-party claims. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### 1. **Broad Definition of ""Claim""**  
   - The clause defines **""Claim""** expansively to include any third-party claim, action, or proceeding (including governmental actions), excluding claims by affiliates. This broad definition ensures coverage for a wide range of legal disputes, aligning with the query’s focus on **""broad-based claims.""**

### 2. **Indemnification Scope**  
   The Indemnifying Party must defend and hold harmless the other party for claims arising from:  
   - **Operations/content of their own site** (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
   - **Product marketing/sales** (with carve-outs for the other party’s products).  
   - **Breach of representations/warranties** or regulatory obligations.  
   - **IP infringement** due to materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  

   This covers **diverse scenarios** (e.g., regulatory actions, IP disputes, product liability), demonstrating the clause’s applicability to **broad-based claims**.

### 3. **Exclusions and Limitations**  
   - **Consequential damages** are excluded (Section 8.2) unless tied to a third-party judgment covered by indemnification (e.g., damages awarded to a third party in a claim under Section 7.2).  
   - This clarifies that while **direct claims** (e.g., legal costs, judgments) are indemnified, **indirect losses** (e.g., lost profits) generally are not, unless they stem from a third-party claim.  

### 4. **Procedural Safeguards**  
   - Section 7.3 (omitted but referenced) likely outlines **notice requirements** and control of defense, ensuring the Indemnifying Party can manage claims efficiently.  

### Relevance to the Query  
The clause explicitly addresses **first-party indemnification** (each party indemnifies the other) for **broad third-party claims**, including regulatory, IP, and product-related disputes. It balances breadth (covering multiple claim types) with limitations (excluding consequential damages unless indemnifiable). This structure protects parties from **wide-ranging liabilities** while preventing open-ended exposure.  

**Key Takeaway:** The clause is a robust example of first-party indemnification tailored to **broad claims**, with clear triggers, exclusions, and procedural rules to manage risk.",5
first party indemnification of broad-based claims,596576fcc8,"Section 5.04 Limitations. The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under this Agreement shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall […***…] for such claims until the […***…] of the […***…] shall […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the […***…] of the [… ***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], and (ii) the Indemnifying Party's […***…] for [… ***…] shall not […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…]. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 5.04, the limitations provided in this Section 5.04 shall not apply to (i) any claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (ii) any claim for breach of any agreement or covenant contained herein.","The clause in **Section 5.04** is relevant to the query about **""first-party indemnification of broad-based claims""** because it establishes limitations on the indemnifying party's liability for claims under the agreement, while carving out exceptions for certain high-stakes claims (e.g., fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or breach of covenants). Here’s the breakdown:

### **1. Limitations on Indemnification for Broad-Based Claims**  
The clause restricts the indemnifying party’s liability by:  
- **Thresholds or Deductibles (likely implied by redactions):** The indemnifying party may not be liable until certain conditions (e.g., monetary or procedural thresholds) are met.  
- **Caps on Liability:** The indemnifying party’s total liability may be limited to a specified amount (implied by references to ""only for the […] of the […]"").  
- **Exclusions for Certain Losses:** The clause may exclude liability for certain types of damages (e.g., indirect or consequential losses).  

These limitations help protect the indemnifying party from excessive exposure to broad-based claims (e.g., third-party claims, general breaches, or unspecified liabilities).

### **2. Exceptions to Limitations (Broad Claims Still Covered)**  
The clause explicitly **excludes** the following from the limitations, meaning the indemnifying party remains fully liable for:  
- **Fraud or Intentional Misrepresentation** (e.g., willful misconduct or deceit).  
- **Breach of Key Agreements or Covenants** (e.g., material contractual obligations).  

This ensures that the indemnifying party cannot avoid responsibility for severe or deliberate wrongdoing, even if other claims are capped.

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **balances risk allocation** by limiting exposure to broad indemnification claims while preserving liability for high-priority breaches.  
- It addresses **first-party indemnification** by defining the scope of the indemnifying party’s obligations (what they must cover and what they can limit).  
- The redacted portions likely specify financial or procedural conditions (e.g., minimum claim thresholds, baskets, or caps), which are common in indemnification clauses to prevent trivial or excessive claims.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is a **risk-management tool**—it shields the indemnifying party from unlimited liability for routine claims but ensures accountability for serious misconduct or core contractual breaches. If the query concerns how broad indemnification claims are treated, this clause answers by setting boundaries (with exceptions).

As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The query concerns **""first party indemnification of broad-based claims,""** and the provided indemnification clause is highly relevant because it outlines the scope, conditions, and procedures for indemnification between the parties (Seller and Buyer) in a contract. Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### 1. **Definition of Indemnified Claims**  
   - The clause defines an ""Indemnified Claim"" as any claim where one party (Indemnifying Party) must defend and indemnify the other (Indemnified Party). This includes **broad-based claims** such as:  
     - Third-party claims (e.g., personal injury, property damage, infringement).  
     - Regulatory fines or penalties.  
     - Negligence or misconduct.  

### 2. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   The clause covers **wide-ranging liabilities**, including:  
   - **Seller’s indemnification obligations (Section b):**  
     - Product non-conformance, negligence, IP infringement, regulatory violations, and other agreed matters.  
   - **Buyer’s indemnification obligations (Section c):**  
     - Buyer’s breaches, negligence, IP claims (where Buyer provided licensed IP), and regulatory violations.  

   This demonstrates that indemnification is **not narrowly limited** but extends to **broad categories of claims** (tort, contract, IP, regulatory).  

### 3. **Procedural Safeguards for Indemnification**  
   - **Notice and Cooperation (Section d):** The Indemnified Party must promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and provide cooperation.  
   - **Control of Defense (Section e):** The Indemnifying Party controls the defense/settlement but must act in good faith.  
   - **Conflict Resolution (Section g):** If parties dispute liability, they must attempt to resolve conflicts or proceed separately while preserving reimbursement rights.  

### 4. **Broad Coverage of Losses**  
   Indemnification includes:  
   - Legal fees, expert costs, court fees, settlements, judgments, and regulatory penalties.  
   - **No carve-outs for certain claim types**, reinforcing the broad-based nature of the protection.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause explicitly structures indemnification to cover **wide-ranging claims** (not just specific breaches), ensuring the ""first party"" (either Seller or Buyer, depending on the claim) is protected against diverse third-party liabilities. The language is comprehensive, addressing:  
- **Third-party claims** (tort, IP, regulatory).  
- **First-party obligations** (who must indemnify whom).  
- **Procedural mechanisms** to enforce indemnification broadly.  

Thus, it directly answers the query by showing how a **first party’s indemnification duties** are defined expansively to cover **broad-based claims**.  

**Key Takeaway:** The clause is a robust, detailed indemnification framework designed to allocate risk for a wide spectrum of liabilities between contracting parties.",5
first party indemnification of broad-based claims,4193c11c87,"15. Indemnification. Company shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless North and its employees, officers, agents, and representatives from and against any and all claims, suits, assessments, losses, obligations, penalties, charges, actions, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses including reasonable attorney's fees whether incurred at trial or in connection with any review by appeal or certiorari of both the trial and appellate court levels (collectively referred to as ""Claims"") arising out of or in connection with: a Any claim or action for negligent or intentional misconduct of Company in relation to the advertisement, promotion, or sale of the Endorsed Product, or Company's use of North's Likeness or North's Endorsement to advertise, promote, distribute, or sell the Endorsed Product; or b. Any claim or action for personal injury, death, or property damage resulting from a customer's use of the Endorsed Product; or c. Any claims or action for the breach by Company of any of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.","The query asks about **""first party indemnification of broad-based claims,""** and the provided **Indemnification Clause (Section 15)** is a strong example of such a provision. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### **1. First-Party Indemnification**  
The clause clearly designates the **Company (first party)** as the indemnifying party, requiring it to:  
- **Indemnify** (compensate for losses),  
- **Defend** (cover legal costs), and  
- **Hold harmless** (protect from liability)  
**North (the second party)** and its affiliates against specified claims.  

This is a classic **first-party obligation**, where one contractual party (Company) assumes liability for the other (North).

### **2. Broad-Based Coverage**  
The clause covers a **wide range of claims**, making it ""broad-based"" by including:  
- **Diverse claim types**: Lawsuits, assessments, penalties, damages, attorney fees, etc.  
- **Multiple scenarios**:  
  - **Misconduct claims** (negligence/intentional acts in advertising or use of North’s likeness) **(Subsection a)**.  
  - **Product liability** (injury, death, or property damage from product use) **(Subsection b)**.  
  - **Breach of contract** (violations of warranties/representations) **(Subsection c)**.  

This breadth ensures North is protected from **almost any liability tied to the Company’s actions or the endorsed product**.

### **3. Relevance to the Query**  
The clause directly addresses the query by:  
- Defining **who indemnifies whom** (first-party Company → second-party North).  
- Encompassing **wide-ranging claims** (not limited to narrow issues like IP or confidentiality).  
- Including **third-party claims** (e.g., customer lawsuits) under the indemnity umbrella.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Scope**: The indemnification is **broad** (covers negligence, liability, breach, etc.).  
- **Protection**: North is shielded from **downstream risks** (e.g., customer injuries, legal violations by Company).  
- **First-Party Focus**: The Company bears the burden, aligning with standard **indemnitor-indemnitee** dynamics.  

This clause would satisfy a request for **first-party indemnification of broad-based claims**, as it allocates wide liability to the Company while protecting North comprehensively.

Here’s how it addresses broad-based claims:

### **1. Broad Definition of ""Claim""**  
The clause defines **""Claim""** expansively to include:  
- Any **third-party claim, action, or proceeding** (excluding claims by affiliates).  
- Claims brought by **governmental authorities**, which broadens the scope to regulatory or enforcement actions.  

This ensures that indemnification covers not just private lawsuits but also **administrative, regulatory, or investigative proceedings**, making it broad-based.

### **2. Wide Coverage of Indemnifiable Scenarios**  
The indemnity obligation applies to claims arising from:  
- **Operation/content of the Indemnifying Party’s site** (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
- **Marketing/sale of products/services** (with carve-outs for the Indemnified Party’s contributions).  
- **Breach of representations/warranties** (including regulatory compliance obligations).  
- **IP infringement claims** related to materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  

This **covers a broad spectrum of potential liabilities**, including contractual breaches, regulatory violations, and intellectual property disputes.

### **3. Protection for Affiliates and Representatives**  
The indemnity extends not just to the Indemnified Party but also to its **affiliates, employees, directors, and representatives**, ensuring comprehensive protection against third-party claims.

### **4. Financial Scope of Indemnification**  
The Indemnifying Party must cover:  
- **Legal costs** (attorneys’ fees).  
- **Damages, judgments, and other losses** resulting from the claim.  

This ensures that the Indemnified Party is **fully protected** from financial exposure, not just liability.

### **5. Broad but Conditional**  
While the clause is broad, it includes **limitations**:  
- Exclusions for claims caused by the Indemnified Party’s actions (e.g., materials they supplied).  
- Compliance with procedural requirements (Section 7.3, which likely includes notice and cooperation obligations).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause provides **broad-based indemnification** by:  
✔ Covering **diverse types of claims** (legal, regulatory, IP).  
✔ Protecting **multiple related entities** (affiliates, employees).  
✔ Including **financial liabilities** (legal fees, damages).  
✔ Applying to **third-party claims** (including government actions).  

However, it is **not unlimited**—it excludes claims caused by the Indemnified Party and requires adherence to procedural safeguards. This balances broad protection with reasonable limitations.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause covers **broad-based third-party claims**, including:  
- **Intellectual property infringement** (e.g., patents, copyrights, trademarks).  
- **Privacy/publicity rights violations**.  
- **Claims arising from breaches of warranties or covenants** in the agreement.  
- **Claims tied to each party’s content or services** (e.g., claims against e-centives’ Content or Excite@Home’s services, but with exclusions for materials provided by the other party).  

This ensures protection against diverse legal risks posed by third parties.

### **2. Conditions for Indemnification**  
The clause specifies procedural requirements to trigger indemnification:  
- **Prompt notice** of claims (failure to notify only relieves the indemnifying party if the delay **materially harms** their defense).  
- **Cooperation** in defense/settlement (e.g., sharing information, attending negotiations).  
- **Settlement control**: If a settlement imposes material obligations or liabilities on the indemnified party, their **written consent** is required (cannot be unreasonably withheld).  

These conditions balance the interests of both parties while ensuring efficient resolution of claims.

### **3. Mutual and Symmetrical Protections**  
The clause is **reciprocal**:  
- Application Provider indemnifies Excite@Home for claims tied to its content/services (Section iii).  
- Excite@Home indemnifies Application Provider for claims tied to its content/services (mirrored in Section iii).  

This symmetry ensures neither party bears undue risk for the other’s actions or materials.

Indemnification excludes claims based on:  
- The other party’s **original materials** (e.g., Excite@Home isn’t liable for claims stemming from Excite Content it provided, and vice versa).  
- **Implied warranties**: The clause disclaims all implied warranties (Section c), limiting indemnification to breaches of express terms.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause comprehensively addresses **broad-based third-party claims** by:  
- Defining covered claims (IP, privacy, breaches, etc.).  
- Setting clear conditions for indemnification (notice, cooperation, settlement approval).  
- Allocating risk fairly between parties.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### **1. Broad-Based Indemnification Coverage**  
The clause provides **wide-ranging protection** against third-party claims by covering:  
- **Breach of warranties/representations** (Section 19(a)(iii)(1)): Claims arising from the Application Provider’s failure to comply with its contractual promises.  
- **Content-related claims** (Section 19(a)(iii)(2)): Claims tied to the Application Provider’s content (e.g., IP, privacy, or publicity rights infringement), excluding Excite’s original materials.  
- **Service-related claims** (Section 19(a)(iii)(3)): Claims arising from the Application Provider’s services, again excluding Excite’s content.  

This structure ensures **broad coverage** for third-party claims across multiple scenarios (contract breaches, IP disputes, privacy violations, etc.).

### **2. Exclusions and Limitations**  
While the indemnification is broad, it is **not unlimited**:  
- **Exclusions**: Claims based on Excite’s original content or materials are **excluded** from the Application Provider’s indemnity obligations.  
- **Liability Cap** (Section 20): The clause limits liability to **direct damages** and **amounts actually paid**, excluding consequential/incidental damages unless tied to specific indemnified claims (e.g., IP infringement under Sections 19(a)(iii)(2)-(3)).  

### **3. Relevance to ""Broad-Based"" Query**  
The term **""broad-based""** implies comprehensive coverage, which this clause delivers by:  
- Covering **multiple categories** of third-party claims (IP, privacy, breach of contract).  
- Including **defense costs** (e.g., attorneys’ fees).  
- Applying to **diverse stakeholders** (Excite@Home, affiliates, employees, etc.).  

However, it balances breadth with **specific carve-outs** (Excite’s content) and **liability caps**, ensuring the indemnification is structured but not open-ended.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is a **strong example of broad-based third-party indemnification** with clear boundaries. It protects the indemnified party (Excite@Home) across a wide range of risks while safeguarding the indemnifying party (Application Provider) from unlimited liability through exclusions and caps.

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 8.2 [No Consequential Damages] IS INTENDED TO LIMIT ANY RIGHT OF ACSI TO RECEIVE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.5.2 [Effect of Termination].","This indemnification clause is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of broad-based third-party claims""** because it establishes a comprehensive framework for how the parties (Audible Inc. and the other contracting party) address liabilities arising from third-party claims. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **Definition of ""Claim"" (Broad Scope)**  
   - The clause defines **""Claim""** broadly to include any claim, action, or proceeding by a third party (excluding affiliates), including governmental authorities. This captures a wide range of potential disputes, ensuring the indemnification covers diverse scenarios (e.g., regulatory actions, IP infringement suits, or consumer claims).

### 2. **Indemnification Obligations (Broad Coverage)**  
   The indemnity (Section 7.2) requires each party to:  
   - **Defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the other party (and its affiliates) against third-party claims arising from:  
     - **Operations/content of their own site** (e.g., user-generated content, functionality).  
     - **Sale of products/services** (with carve-outs for the other party’s products).  
     - **Breach of representations/warranties** (e.g., false assurances in the contract).  
     - **IP infringement** (e.g., unauthorized use of copyrighted materials).  
   - This covers **""broad-based"" claims** by shifting liability to the party responsible for the underlying issue (e.g., if Audible’s site violates a law, it indemnifies the other party).  

### 3. **Financial Protections**  
   - The indemnifying party must pay **awards, costs, and attorneys’ fees** tied to the claim, ensuring the indemnified party is fully protected from third-party financial impacts.  
   - **No carve-outs for consequential damages** in third-party claims: Section 8.2 clarifies that indemnification overrides the general exclusion of consequential damages, meaning the indemnifying party **must cover even indirect damages** if awarded by a court to a third party.  

### 4. **Procedural Safeguards**  
   - The reference to **Section 7.3 (Procedure)** implies there are steps (e.g., notice, control of defense) to ensure claims are handled efficiently, reducing ambiguity in enforcement.  

### Why It’s Relevant to the Query  
This clause directly addresses **broad third-party risks** by:  
- Defining claims expansively (not limited to specific issues).  
- Covering legal, financial, and operational liabilities.  
- Explicitly including governmental actions and IP disputes.  
- Overriding limitations on damages when third parties are involved.  

It’s a robust example of how contracts allocate risk for **wide-ranging third-party claims**, ensuring one party doesn’t bear costs for the other’s actions.",5

<omitted>
iii) Application Provider will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Excite@Home, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents from any and all third party claims, liability, damages and/or costs (including, but not limited to, attorneys fees) arising from:
(1) Its breach of any warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; or
(2) Any claim (including, without limitation, claims for infringement of third party intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights) arising from the e-centives Content, including, without limitation, e-centives' trademarks, but excluding claims based upon the Excite Content or any other materials provided by Excite in the form originally provided by Excite; or
(3) Any claims (including, without limitation, claims for infringement of third party intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights), by third parties arising out of or based upon e-centives' services and/or any other service provided by e-centives, but excluding claims based upon the Excite Content or any other information or materials provided by Excite in the form originally provided by Excite.
20. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Except as provided by Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2) and (b)(iii)(3):
a) Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
b) Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of broad-based third-party claims""** because it explicitly outlines the scope and limitations of indemnification obligations for third-party claims. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### 1. **Broad Coverage for Third-Party Claims**  
   - The clause requires the **Application Provider** (e-centives) to indemnify Excite@Home and its affiliates against **""any and all third-party claims""**, including liability, damages, and legal costs (e.g., attorneys' fees).  
   - The coverage is broad, encompassing claims arising from:  
     - Breach of warranties/representations in the agreement (Section 19(a)(iii)(1)).  
     - Intellectual property (IP), publicity, or privacy rights violations related to e-centives' content/services (Sections 19(a)(iii)(2) and (3)).  
     - Claims tied to e-centives' trademarks or services, excluding Excite-provided materials.  

### 2. **Exclusions and Limitations**  
   - The indemnification **excludes claims based on Excite’s content or materials** (as originally provided by Excite). This carves out liability for third-party claims stemming from Excite’s own actions.  
   - The **Limitation of Liability clause (Section 20)** further narrows the scope:  
     - Liability is generally restricted to **direct damages** (no consequential/incidental damages).  
     - However, **indemnification obligations under Sections 19(a)(iii)(2) and (3) are exempt** from this limitation, meaning the Application Provider remains fully liable for third-party IP/privacy claims.  

### 3. **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
   - **Broad-Based Claims**: The clause covers a wide range of third-party claims (IP, privacy, breach of contract) but is not unlimited—it excludes Excite’s own content.  
   - **Defense Obligation**: The Application Provider must **defend** (not just indemnify) Excite@Home, adding proactive legal protection.  
   - **Survival of Indemnity**: Unlike general liability caps, indemnification for third-party claims survives the limitation clause, ensuring robust protection for Excite@Home.  

### Why This Matters  
For a party seeking indemnification against broad third-party risks (e.g., IP lawsuits, privacy violations), this clause provides strong safeguards while balancing exclusions for the other party’s (Excite’s) own liabilities. The carve-outs in Section 20 ensure that indemnification for third-party claims remains enforceable even when other damages are capped.

Section 10.4 Defense of Action. A Party offering indemnification or defense under this Article X (each, an ""Indemnitor"") shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of any and all claims, suits, proceedings, and actions for which such Indemnitor is obligated to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend hereunder, but the Party or Representative of a Party receiving such indemnification or defense under this Article X (each, the ""Indemnitee"") shall have the right to participate in such claims, suits, proceedings, and actions at its own cost and expense. An Indemnitor shall have no liability under this Article unless the Indemnitee gives notice of such claim to the Indemnitor promptly after the Indemnitee learns of such claim so as to not prejudice the Indemnitor. Under no circumstance shall either party hereto settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any claim, suit, proceeding, or action that is the subject of indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably.","The query concerns **""indemnification of broad-based third-party claims,""** and the provided clause (Article X) comprehensively addresses this issue by outlining the indemnification obligations between **Network Affiliate** and **NCM** for third-party claims. Here’s how the clause aligns with the query:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause explicitly covers **""any and all third-party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings""** (Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3), which aligns with the **broad-based** nature of the query. The indemnification obligations extend to:  
- **Legal costs** (attorneys' fees, settlements, judgments, etc.).  
- **Various liabilities** (infringement, breach of contract, fraud, noncompliance with law).  

### **2. Broad Coverage of Scenarios**  
The indemnification provisions are structured to cover a **wide range of third-party claims**, including:  
- **Intellectual Property (IP) Infringement** (Sections 10.1(ii) and 10.3(a)) – Claims arising from trademark, copyright, or patent violations.  
- **Breach of Contract** (Sections 10.1(i) and 10.2(i)) – Claims due to violations of Article IX.  
- **Fraud, Willful Misconduct, or Illegal Acts** (Sections 10.1(iv) and 10.2(ii)) – Claims stemming from unlawful behavior.  
- **Unauthorized Use of Property** (Section 10.1(iii)) – Claims from misuse of NCM’s assets.  

### **3. Defense and Settlement Rights** (Section 10.4)  
- The **Indemnitor (defending party)** has the **right to control the defense and settlement** of third-party claims.  
- The **Indemnitee (protected party)** may participate but **at its own expense**.  
- **Prompt notice** is required to avoid prejudicing the Indemnitor.  
- **No settlement without consent** (preventing unilateral resolutions that could harm the other party).  

### **4. Limitations and Exclusions** (Section 10.3(c))  
While broad, the indemnification has **reasonable carve-outs**, such as:  
- No liability for infringement caused by **Network Affiliate’s modifications** or **unauthorized combinations** with third-party products.  
- **No obligation** if the claim could have been avoided by using an updated version of NCM’s property.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause is **highly relevant** to the query because it:  
✔ **Broadly covers third-party claims** (IP, breach, misconduct, etc.).  
✔ **Defines defense and settlement procedures** (control, notice, consent).  
✔ **Balances obligations with reasonable limitations** (excluding scenarios where the indemnitee is at fault).  

Thus, it provides a **comprehensive framework** for handling **broad-based third-party claims** while protecting both parties’ interests.",5

Here’s how the provided clauses are relevant:

### **1. Indemnification for Third-Party Claims (Article 12)**  
The contract explicitly addresses third-party claims arising from fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct:  
- **Section 12.1 (BLI’s Indemnity Obligation):**  
  - BLI must indemnify Ginkgo against third-party claims (""Claims"") and associated losses (""Losses"") if they result from:  
    - **BLI’s negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (Section 12.1(b)).  
    - Breach of contract or misrepresentation by BLI (Section 12.1(a)).  
- **Section 12.2 (Ginkgo’s Indemnity Obligation):**  
  - Similarly, Ginkgo must indemnify BLI for third-party claims caused by:  
    - **Ginkgo’s negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (Section 12.2(b)).  
    - Breach of contract or misrepresentation by Ginkgo (Section 12.2(a)).  

**Relevance to Query:**  
These clauses ensure that if a third party sues one party (e.g., Ginkgo) due to the other party’s (e.g., BLI’s) fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, the responsible party (BLI) must cover the damages.  

### **2. Exclusions from Liability Limitations (Sections 11.6 & 11.7)**  
The contract limits liability for certain damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential damages) **except** in specific cases, including:  
- **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (Section 11.6(E) & 11.7(A)(V)):**  
  - The liability cap does **not** apply to damages arising from these wrongful acts.  
  - This means a party can be held fully liable (beyond typical contractual limits) for fraud or gross negligence.  
- **Indemnification obligations (Section 11.6(F) & 11.7(A)(VI)):**  
  - Claims under Article 12 (indemnification) are also exempt from liability caps.  

**Relevance to Query:**  
If a third-party claim arises from fraud or gross negligence, the at-fault party cannot rely on the general liability limitations—they remain fully responsible for indemnification.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query:**  
1. **Indemnification Covers Third-Party Claims:**  
   - If a third party sues due to fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct by one party, the other party is indemnified (Article 12).  
2. **No Liability Cap for Misconduct:**  
   - The standard exclusions for consequential damages and liability limits **do not apply** to fraud, gross negligence, or indemnification claims (Sections 11.6 & 11.7).  
3. **Mutual Protection:**  
   - Both parties are equally protected if the other’s misconduct triggers third-party claims.  

### **Practical Implications:**  
- A party engaging in fraud or gross negligence cannot shield itself from full liability.  
- Third-party claims (e.g., lawsuits from customers, regulators, or employees) stemming from such misconduct will be covered by the indemnifying party.

12.1 Indemnification by BLI. BLI will indemnify, defend and hold Ginkgo and its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, employees, licensees, sublicensees, Permitted Subcontractors and agents (each, a """"Ginkgo Indemnitee"""") harmless from and against any and all suits, claims, proceedings and causes of action brought by a Third Party (collectively, """"Claims"""") and all associated damages, liabilities, expenses and losses, including reasonable legal expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees (collectively, """"Losses""""), to the extent caused by or arising as a result of (a) the breach by BLI of this Agreement or material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by BLI under this Agreement, (b) the negligence, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by a BLI Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement, (c) [***], and (d) any Claims by BLI's employees, Permitted Subcontractors or agents for worker's compensation or other liability coverage, insurance, benefits, and other employee-related claims, in each case of clauses (a)-(d) of this Section 12.1 (Indemnification by BLI), except to the extent Ginkgo has an obligation to indemnify an BLI Indemnitee in connection with such Claims and Losses pursuant to Section 12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo).
12.2 Indemnification by Ginkgo. Ginkgo will indemnify, defend and hold BLI and its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, employees, Permitted Subcontractors and agents (each, an """"BLI Indemnitee"""") harmless from and against any and all Claims and Losses, to the extent caused by or arising as a result of (a) the breach by Ginkgo of this Agreement or material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Ginkgo under this Agreement, (b) the negligence, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement, (c) [***] and (d) any Claims by Ginkgo's employees, Permitted Subcontractors or agents for worker's compensation or other liability coverage, insurance, benefits, and other employee-related claims, and (e) the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, importation, distribution, sale or other commercialization of Ginkgo Inventions by Ginkgo or its Affiliates, agents, licensees, sublicensees or customers, in each case of clauses (a)-(e) of this Section 12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo) except to the extent BLI has an obligation to indemnify a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with such Claims and Losses pursuant to Section 12.1 (Indemnification by BLI).","The query concerns **third-party claims related to fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct** and how indemnity applies in such cases. The provided clauses (11.6, 11.7, 12.1, and 12.2) are highly relevant to this query for the following reasons:

### **1. Exclusion of Liability Limits for Fraud/Negligence/Willful Misconduct**  
- **Clause 11.6 (No Consequential damages)** and **11.7 (Liability Limit)** explicitly state that the **limitations on liability (e.g., no consequential damages, capped liability) do NOT apply** in cases involving:  
  - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (Section 11.6(E), 11.7(a)(V))  
  - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12** (Section 11.6(F), 11.7(a)(VI))  

  This means that if a third-party claim arises due to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the liable party **cannot rely on contractual liability caps or exclusions**—they may be exposed to **full damages**, including consequential or indirect losses.

### **2. Indemnification for Third-Party Claims (Article 12)**  
- **12.1 (Indemnification by BLI)** and **12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo)** require each party to **defend and indemnify** the other against third-party claims (""Claims"") and associated losses (""Losses"") arising from:  
  - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (Section 12.1(b), 12.2(b))  
  - Breach of contract or misrepresentation (Section 12.1(a), 12.2(a))  
  - Certain other specified risks (e.g., employee claims, product liability under Ginkgo’s commercialization activities).  

  **Key Takeaway:** If a third party sues Ginkgo or BLI due to the other party’s **fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct**, the at-fault party must **indemnify** the other (i.e., cover legal costs, damages, and settlements).  

### **3. Interaction Between Liability Limits & Indemnity**  
- While **general liability is capped** (Section 11.7), **fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct** are **exempt from these caps**—meaning the liable party bears **full financial responsibility**.  
- **Indemnification obligations (Article 12) override liability limitations**, ensuring that third-party claims (including those based on misconduct) are fully covered.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clauses confirm that:

2. **Third-party claims** arising from such misconduct **trigger indemnification**, requiring the at-fault party to cover all resulting losses.

The provided clauses (11.6 and 11.7) are highly relevant because they carve out exceptions to limitations of liability for such conduct, including indemnification obligations. Here’s the breakdown:

### **Key Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Exclusion from Liability Caps for Bad Acts**  
   - Both clauses explicitly **exclude** liability limits for claims arising from:  
     - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (Sections 11.6(E) and 11.7(a)(V)).  
     - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12** (Sections 11.6(F) and 11.7(a)(VI)).  
   - This means a party **cannot shield itself** from full liability (including consequential damages) for these categories, even if the agreement otherwise caps damages or excludes indirect losses.

2. **Indemnification Link**  
   - Article 12 (referenced in both clauses) likely governs **third-party claims** (e.g., if a third party sues one party for the other’s fraud or negligence).  
   - The carve-outs ensure that indemnification obligations for third-party claims **survive** the general liability limitations.  

3. **Consequential Damages for Bad Acts**  
   - Section 11.6 typically bars claims for **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits) but **explicitly allows them** for fraud, gross negligence, or indemnification claims.  
   - Thus, a third-party claimant (or the indemnified party) could pursue **full damages**, including consequential losses, if the claim falls under these exceptions.

### **Practical Implications for Third-Party Claims:**
- If a third party sues **Party A** due to **Party B’s fraud or gross negligence**, Party A can seek indemnification from Party B under Article 12 **without being restricted** by the liability cap in 11.7 or the consequential damages waiver in 11.6.  
- The clauses ensure that **bad actors cannot hide behind contractual liability limits** when their intentional or egregious conduct harms others (including third parties).  

### **Summary:**  
These provisions reinforce that **fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, and related indemnity obligations are treated as high-stakes exceptions**, allowing aggrieved parties (including third parties via indemnification) to recover broader damages than the contract would otherwise permit.",5
"third party claim indemnity of fraud, negligence or willful misconduct",3c70adb906,"EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO OBLIGATIONS TO INDEMNIFY A PARTY FOR CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (OR ITS AFFILIATES) PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, TREBLE, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE OF, OR FAILURE TO PERFORM, ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARE CAUSED BY THE SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS BEING WAIVED HEREBY.","This clause is relevant to the query about **third-party claim indemnity for fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct** in the following ways:

### 1. **Preservation of Third-Party Indemnity Obligations**  
   - The clause explicitly **carves out an exception** for indemnification obligations related to **third-party claims**. This means that while the parties waive liability for most types of damages (e.g., consequential, indirect, punitive) between themselves, they **do not waive liability for claims brought by third parties**.  
   - If a third party sues one party (e.g., for fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct), the other party **may still be required to indemnify** the sued party under the agreement, unless another provision limits or excludes such indemnity.

### 2. **Waiver of Direct Liability Between Parties**  
   - The clause broadly limits liability between the parties for **consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, or similar damages**, even if caused by **negligence, strict liability, or fault** (including sole, joint, or concurrent negligence).  
   - However, this waiver **does not apply to third-party claims**, meaning the indemnity obligation for third-party claims (including those alleging fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct) remains intact unless expressly excluded elsewhere in the contract.

### 3. **No Explicit Exclusion for Fraud or Willful Misconduct**  
   - While the clause mentions negligence and strict liability, it does **not explicitly exclude fraud or willful misconduct** from the waiver of liability between the parties.  
   - However, many jurisdictions **do not enforce waivers for fraud or intentional misconduct** as a matter of public policy, meaning such claims might still be actionable despite this clause.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause **preserves the right to seek indemnity for third-party claims** (including those based on fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct) while **limiting liability for damages between the contracting parties themselves**. If a third party sues, the indemnity obligations would still apply unless another provision overrides this.  

For a complete analysis, you would need to review:  
- The **indemnity section** of the agreement (to confirm the scope of third-party claims covered).  
- Any **carve-outs for fraud or willful misconduct** in other clauses.  
- Governing law (to determine enforceability of waivers for intentional wrongdoing).

"third party claim indemnity of fraud, negligence or willful misconduct",6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The clause you provided (Section 13.4 ""Limitation of Liability"") is relevant to the query about **third-party claims involving indemnity for fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct** in the following ways:

### 1. **General Limitation of Liability**  
The clause broadly limits both parties' liability for certain types of damages (e.g., consequential, indirect, punitive) **unless** they arise from:  
   - A breach of confidentiality (Section 11), or  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (explicitly carved out from the limitation).  

This means that while the clause restricts liability for ordinary breaches, it **does not shield a party from liability for third-party claims** (e.g., fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct) if those claims trigger indemnification obligations elsewhere in the contract.

### 2. **Third-Party Claims Exception**  
The clause explicitly states that the limitation **does not apply** to damages awarded to a third party under a **Third-Party Claim**.  
   - If a third party sues Party A for fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct by Party B, and Party A is entitled to indemnification from Party B under the contract, Party B **cannot use this clause to avoid liability**.  
   - The carve-out ensures that indemnification obligations (which typically cover third-party claims) override the general limitation of liability.

### 3. **Fraud, Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
While the clause does not explicitly mention these terms, its exception for indemnification obligations implies that:  
   - If the contract includes indemnity for third-party claims **arising from fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct**, this clause **does not limit** such liability.  
   - However, if the contract’s indemnification section **excludes** these acts (e.g., by capping liability or disclaiming responsibility for intentional wrongdoing), the clause may still apply.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause **preserves liability for third-party claims** (like fraud or negligence) if indemnification is required under the contract. It limits only certain types of damages (e.g., indirect or punitive) **unless** they are awarded to a third party. To fully assess the relevance to your query, you would need to review:  
   - The **indemnification section** of the contract (to confirm coverage for fraud/negligence).  
   - **Applicable law** (which may override limitations for intentional misconduct).

Here’s how the clause aligns with the query:

### **1. Third-Party Claim Indemnity Scope**  
The clause defines scenarios where each party must indemnify the other against third-party claims:  
- **Accuray’s Indemnity (10.1 & 10.2)**: Covers claims related to:  
  - **Intellectual Property (IP) infringement** (e.g., patents, copyrights, trade secrets) for products provided under the agreement.  
  - **Product safety** when used according to Accuray’s specifications.  
  - *Limitation*: Accuray’s obligation is contingent on Distributor’s compliance with notice/cooperation requirements (10.1(i)–(iii)).  

- **Distributor’s Indemnity (10.6)**: Covers claims arising from:  
  - **Distributor’s non-compliance** with the agreement (e.g., acts/omissions violating terms).  
  - **Misrepresentations** about Accuray’s products/services.  
  - *Limitation*: Liability is excluded for consequential/punitive damages (unless due to IP misuse, willful misconduct, or legal non-compliance).  

### **2. Compliance as a Condition for Indemnity**  
Indemnification is **explicitly tied to proper use and adherence to the agreement**:  
- Accuray’s indemnity for product safety (10.2) applies only if the product is used **""according to Accuray’s written Specifications.""**  
- Distributor’s indemnity (10.6) applies only if claims stem from **acts ""not in accordance with this Agreement""** (e.g., misuse or misrepresentation).  

### **3. Liability Limitations Reinforce Compliance Focus**  
- **Exclusions (10.6)**: Neither party is liable for consequential damages (e.g., lost profits) **unless** the claim involves:  
  - Unauthorized IP use, willful misconduct, or breach of mandatory law (e.g., strict product liability).  
- **Cap (11.3)**: Liability is capped at purchase prices paid in the prior 12 months, except for IP breaches or intentional misconduct.  

### **Relevance to Query**  
The clause directly links indemnity for third-party claims to **compliance with the agreement’s terms** (e.g., proper product use, adherence to specifications, and avoidance of misrepresentations). It also limits indemnity obligations to claims arising from **permitted uses** and excludes liability for non-compliant acts.  

**Key Takeaway**: The indemnity protections are **conditional on compliance** with the agreement, and non-compliant use (e.g., off-label product applications) could void indemnity rights.",5

Here’s how the clause addresses this:  

### **1. Accuray’s Indemnity (10.1 & 10.2)**  
Accuray agrees to indemnify the Distributor against third-party claims, but **only if**:  
- The claim arises from the **Product’s infringement** (patent, copyright, trade secret) or **unsafe use per Accuray’s specifications** (products liability).  
- The Distributor **complies with the agreement** by:  
  - Promptly notifying Accuray of the claim.  
  - Giving Accuray **sole control** of defense/settlement.  
  - Providing reasonable assistance.  

**Relevance to Query:**  
The indemnity is **limited**—Accuray only covers claims if the Distributor uses the Product **as intended under the agreement** (i.e., per Accuray’s specifications and without unauthorized modifications).  

### **2. Distributor’s Indemnity (10.6)**  
The Distributor must indemnify Accuray for third-party claims arising from:  
- **Non-compliance with the agreement** (e.g., misuse of Products, breach of contract).  
- **Misrepresentations** about the Products or Accuray.  

**Relevance to Query:**  
This reinforces that indemnity protection is **conditional on compliance**. If the Distributor acts outside the agreement (e.g., misusing Products or making false claims), they **lose indemnity rights** and must cover claims themselves.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The indemnity clauses **tie protection to proper use under the agreement**:  
- Accuray covers claims **only if** Products are used as specified.  
- The Distributor is liable for claims **stemming from non-compliance**.  

Thus, the indemnity is **expressly limited to compliant use**, aligning with the query.",5

The provided clause (Section 10) outlines the indemnification obligations between **Accuray** (the supplier/manufacturer) and **Distributor**, specifically addressing third-party claims under certain conditions. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### **Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Indemnity Scope Linked to Compliance with Agreement**  
   - **Accuray’s Indemnity (10.1 and 10.2)**: Accuray agrees to indemnify the Distributor for third-party claims **only if** the claims arise from:  
     - **Infringement** (patent/copyright/trade secret) of products provided by Accuray **under the Agreement** (10.1).  
     - **Product safety issues** when used **according to Accuray’s written Specifications** (10.2).  
     - Both subsections require the Distributor to comply with the Agreement (e.g., prompt notice, ceding control of defense) to trigger indemnity.  

   - **Distributor’s Indemnity (10.6)**: The Distributor must indemnify Accuray for third-party claims arising from:  
     - **Distributor’s acts/omissions not in compliance with the Agreement** (e.g., misuse of products, unauthorized modifications).  
     - **Misrepresentations** about the products/services.  
     - This explicitly ties indemnity obligations to **compliance with the Agreement**.

2. **Limitation to Contractual Use**  
   - The indemnities are **conditional** on the products being used **as specified in the Agreement** (e.g., per Accuray’s Specifications in 10.2).  
   - If the Distributor (or a downstream customer) uses the products **outside the agreed terms**, Accuray’s indemnity would not apply, and the Distributor would bear liability (per 10.6(i)).  

3. **Third-Party Claims Focus**  
   - The entire clause addresses **third-party claims** (e.g., infringement, safety lawsuits) and allocates responsibility based on **who caused the issue** (Accuray’s product design vs. Distributor’s non-compliant actions).  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
The clause directly links indemnification to **compliance with the Agreement** and **proper use of products**. It limits indemnity to scenarios where:  
- Accuray’s products are used **as intended under the contract** (10.1/10.2).  
- The Distributor follows the Agreement’s terms (10.6).  
Any deviation shifts liability to the non-compliant party, addressing the query’s focus on **limited indemnity tied to contractual compliance**.

The provided **Article 8 (Indemnification)** directly addresses this by defining the scope of indemnification obligations for both the **Suppliers** and the **Company**, with specific limitations tied to compliance with the agreement.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Indemnity for Third-Party Claims**  
   - Both **Suppliers (8.1)** and the **Company (8.2)** agree to indemnify each other against third-party claims related to:  
     - **IP infringement** (if the Product violates third-party rights).  
     - **Product liability** (if a manufacturing defect causes harm).  

2. **Limitation to Compliance with Agreement**  
   The indemnity **excludes claims arising from non-compliant use**, such as:  
   - **Modification of the Product** by unauthorized parties (e.g., if the Company modifies the Supplier’s Product without approval, the Supplier is not liable).  
   - **Improper combination/use** (e.g., using the Product with unapproved third-party materials voids indemnity).  
   - **Fault of the indemnified party** (e.g., if the Company’s negligence causes the claim, the Supplier is not responsible).  

3. **Key Compliance Conditions**  
   - Indemnity applies **only if the Product is used as agreed** (e.g., unmodified and not combined with unapproved components).  
   - **Supplier/Company approval is required** for settlements, ensuring control over claim resolution.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **explicitly limits indemnity to compliant use**—if a third-party claim arises due to **unauthorized modifications, misuse, or fault of the indemnified party**, the indemnifying party (Supplier or Company) is **not liable**. This aligns with the query by ensuring indemnification is **conditional on proper use per the agreement**.

(A) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHERS, OR TO ANY PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH OR UNDER THE OTHER, FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS ARTICLE 9 IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BARGAIN AND ABSENT THIS ARTICLE 9 THE ECONOMIC AND OTHER TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT.","The query asks about **third-party claim indemnity limited to use of products in compliance with the agreement**. The provided clauses (Article 8 and 9.1) address this directly by:

### **1. Indemnification Scope (Article 8)**  
The indemnity obligations in **Article 8** are explicitly tied to third-party claims arising from:  
- **Intellectual Property (IP) infringement** (Section 8.1(a) and 8.2(a)) or  
- **Product liability due to manufacturing defects** (Section 8.1(b) and 8.2(b)).  

However, the indemnity is **limited** to claims where the product was used **in compliance with the agreement**, as evidenced by the exclusions:  
- **Modification by unauthorized parties** (e.g., by the Company or third parties, unless approved by the Supplier/Company) (Sections 8.1(i) and 8.2(i)).  
- **Combination/use with non-approved products/methods** (Sections 8.1(ii) and 8.2(ii)).  
- **Fault of the Company** (Section 8.1(iii)).  

Thus, indemnity applies **only if the product was used as intended under the agreement**; deviations (e.g., unauthorized modifications or combinations) void the indemnity.  

### **2. Liability Cap (Article 9.1)**  
While Article 8 defines the **scope** of indemnity, **Article 9.1** reinforces the limitation by:  
- Excluding liability for **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) unless tied to IP breaches, confidentiality, or third-party indemnity obligations (Article 8).  
- Capping liability at **12 months of payments** for the affected products, further limiting exposure for non-compliant use.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clauses collectively ensure that:  
1. **Indemnity is conditional** on proper use (compliance with the agreement).  
2. **Liability is capped** even for valid claims, with carve-outs for breaches of core terms (e.g., IP, confidentiality).  

In short, third-party claims are indemnified **only if the product was used per the agreement’s terms**, and the indemnifying party’s liability is strictly bounded.",5
indemnification that covers violation of law,3aed540ab1,"(a) Indemnification. Each Party (""Indemnifying Party"") shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the other Party (""Indemnified Party"") and its officers, directors, agents, employees, and affiliates, from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, costs, expenses, liabilities, judgments, causes of action, proceedings, suits, losses and damages of any nature, which are threatened or brought against, or are suffered or incurred by, the Indemnified Party or any such person to the extent caused directly by acts or omissions of the Indemnifying Party relating to this Agreement, including without limitation (i) any negligent or tortious conduct, (ii) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or conditions of the Indemnifying Party contained in this Agreement, (iii) any violation of applicable laws or regulations, (iv) infringement or violation of any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary interest of any third party, and (v) any breach of any express or implied warranties relating to the Products, including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.","The **indemnification clause** you provided is highly relevant to the query regarding **""indemnification that covers violation of law""** because it explicitly includes protection against legal violations. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### **1. Explicit Coverage of Legal Violations**  
The clause states that the **Indemnifying Party** must indemnify the **Indemnified Party** for:  
> *""any and all claims, demands, actions... to the extent caused directly by acts or omissions of the Indemnifying Party relating to this Agreement, including without limitation... (iii) any violation of applicable laws or regulations.""*  

This means that if one party breaches a law or regulation in connection with the agreement, they must compensate the other party for resulting liabilities (e.g., fines, lawsuits, or enforcement actions).

### **2. Broad Scope of Protection**  
The indemnification covers:  
- **Regulatory violations** (e.g., non-compliance with data protection laws, employment laws, industry-specific regulations).  
- **Third-party claims** (e.g., lawsuits from customers or regulators due to unlawful conduct).  
- **Legal costs** (defense fees, settlements, penalties).  

### **3. Link to the Agreement’s Performance**  
The clause ties indemnification to acts/omissions **""relating to this Agreement,""** meaning it applies only to legal violations connected to the contract (not unrelated misconduct).  

### **4. Additional Relevant Protections**  
While subsection (iii) directly addresses legal violations, other subsections reinforce coverage:  
- **(i) Negligent/tortious conduct** (e.g., violations due to negligence).  
- **(ii) Breach of contractual terms** (if the contract requires compliance with laws).  
- **(iv) Intellectual property violations** (a subset of legal breaches).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **explicitly and broadly** covers indemnification for violations of law, ensuring that the **Indemnified Party** is protected if the **Indemnifying Party’s** unlawful actions cause harm. It is a strong safeguard against regulatory, civil, and third-party legal risks arising from the agreement.

indemnification that covers violation of law,748fd40472,"12. Indemnity and Liability
12.1 Each Party (""""Indemnitor"""") will defend, indemnify and hold the other Party (including associated officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and affiliates) (cumulatively, """"Indemnitee"""") harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees), suffered or incurred as a result of or in connection with any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding brought against Indemnitee based upon (a) a claim of a failure to perform, or a breach by Indemnitor of, any obligation, warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; (b) a claim of personal injury or property damage arising out of the fault or negligence of Indemnitor, its representatives, agents, or employees; or (c) a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right held by any third party.","The query asks about **indemnification that covers violation of law**, and the provided clause (Section 12.1) addresses this indirectly but not explicitly. Here’s the relevance:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   The clause requires the Indemnitor to defend and indemnify the Indemnitee against losses arising from:  
   - Breach of contractual obligations (subsection **a**),  
   - Negligence or fault causing personal injury/property damage (subsection **b**), or  
   - Intellectual property infringement (subsection **c**).  

2. **Connection to Violation of Law**:  
   - While the clause does not **explicitly** mention ""violation of law,"" certain breaches or claims could involve legal violations:  
     - **Subsection (a)**: If a party’s breach of the agreement (e.g., failing to comply with a term) also violates a statutory or regulatory requirement, the indemnification could extend to resulting liabilities.  
     - **Subsection (b)**: Negligence leading to property damage or injury might involve violations of health/safety laws.  
     - **Subsection (c)**: IP infringement claims inherently involve violations of intellectual property laws.  

3. **Limitations**:  
   - The clause does **not** broadly cover **all** violations of law (e.g., fines for regulatory non-compliance unrelated to the agreement). It is tied to claims arising from the specific contexts listed (contract breach, negligence, IP).  
   - For explicit coverage of statutory/regulatory violations, the clause would need language like:  
     *""…or (d) any violation of applicable laws, regulations, or governmental requirements by Indemnitor.""*  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause **partially** addresses violations of law but only to the extent they overlap with:  
- Contractual breaches involving legal non-compliance,  
- Negligence claims tied to legal duties, or  
- IP infringement (a subset of legal violations).  

For comprehensive coverage of **all** legal violations, the clause would require expansion to include standalone legal non-compliance (e.g., tax, labor, or environmental law breaches).  

**Recommendation**: If the goal is explicit protection against legal violations, amend the clause to add a subsection (d) specifically addressing indemnification for fines, penalties, or liabilities arising from statutory/regulatory breaches.

indemnification that covers violation of law,9481d8fbb6,"12. Indemnity and Liability
12.1 Each Party (""Indemnitor"") will defend, indemnify and hold the other Party (including associated officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and affiliates) (cumulatively, ""Indemnitee"") harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees), suffered or incurred as a result of or in connection with any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding brought against Indemnitee based upon (a) a claim of a failure to perform, or a breach by Indemnitor of, any obligation, warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; (b) a claim of personal injury or property damage arising out of the fault or negligence of Indemnitor, its representatives, agents, or employees; or (c) a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right held by any third party.","The query asks about **indemnification that covers violation of law**, and the provided clause (Section 12.1) outlines the scope of indemnification obligations between the parties. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### **Relevance to Violation of Law:**
1. **Explicit Coverage (Subsection (a))**:  
   - The clause requires the Indemnitor to indemnify the Indemnitee for claims arising from a **""breach of any obligation, warranty, representation, or covenant""** in the agreement.  
   - If the agreement includes **legal compliance obligations** (e.g., representations that a party will comply with applicable laws), a violation of law could trigger indemnification under this subsection.  
   - *Example*: If Party A violates data protection laws (e.g., GDPR) despite warranting compliance in the agreement, Party A would indemnify Party B for resulting claims.

2. **Implicit Coverage (Subsection (b) & (c))**:  
   - **Negligence or Fault (Subsection (b))**: If a violation of law (e.g., workplace safety regulations) results from the Indemnitor’s negligence, claims could fall under this provision.  
   - **Third-Party IP Rights (Subsection (c))**: Violations of intellectual property laws (e.g., copyright infringement) are explicitly covered.  

### **Limitations (Gaps in Coverage):**  
- The clause does **not explicitly mention ""violation of law""** as a standalone category. Instead, it ties indemnification to:  
  - Contractual breaches (which may include legal compliance promises).  
  - Negligence or fault (which may involve legal violations).  
  - IP infringement (a subset of legal violations).  
- **Intentional or Criminal Acts**: Unless the agreement specifies otherwise, intentional illegal acts (e.g., fraud) may not be covered if they fall outside the defined categories.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
The clause **indirectly** covers violations of law **if** they are linked to:  
1. A breach of the agreement’s terms (e.g., where compliance with laws is a contractual obligation).  
2. Negligence or infringement claims.  

For **explicit coverage of legal violations**, the clause would need broader language (e.g., adding ""violation of any applicable law"" as a standalone indemnity trigger).

indemnification that covers violation of law,eb53e37b8b,"25. Indemnification. The Parties shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other, their heirs, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, expenses, causes of action, suits, claims, and judgments of any kind or character for injury to person or property arising in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT, whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise.","The **indemnification clause** you provided is relevant to the query (""indemnification that covers violation of law"") in the following ways:

### 1. **Broad Scope of Covered Claims**  
The clause requires each party to indemnify the other against **""any and all losses, liabilities, damages... suits, claims, and judgments of any kind or character.""** This broad language could encompass claims arising from **violations of law**, provided such violations are tied to the responsibilities under the agreement.  

   - If a party's actions (or failures to act) under the agreement result in a **legal violation** (e.g., breach of regulatory requirements, statutory duties, or contractual obligations), the indemnification obligation may apply.  
   - Example: If Party A fails to comply with data protection laws while performing under the agreement, and Party B faces fines or lawsuits as a result, Party A may be required to indemnify Party B.  

### 2. **""Arising Out of the Responsibilities in this Agreement""**  
The clause ties indemnification to liabilities **""arising in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT.""**  
   - If a violation of law stems from a party’s performance (or non-performance) of its contractual duties, indemnification would likely apply.  
   - Example: If the agreement requires Party A to handle hazardous materials and Party A violates environmental laws, resulting in liability for Party B, Party A could be obligated to indemnify Party B.  

### 3. **No Explicit Exclusion for Illegal Acts**  
The clause does **not** explicitly exclude **willful misconduct, intentional violations of law, or illegal acts** (though some jurisdictions may limit enforcement of indemnity for intentional wrongdoing).  
   - Without such exclusions, a court might interpret the clause as covering **negligent or unintentional legal violations** tied to the agreement.  

### 4. **Potential Gaps for Explicit Violations of Law**  
While the clause is broad, it does **not expressly mention ""violations of law""**—unlike some indemnity clauses that explicitly address fines, penalties, or regulatory breaches.  
   - To ensure clear coverage, the clause could be strengthened by adding language like:  
     *""including, without limitation, claims arising from violations of applicable laws, regulations, or statutory duties.""*  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **implicitly** covers violations of law if they arise from the parties' contractual responsibilities. However, it could be **more explicit** to avoid disputes. If the parties intend to include (or exclude) indemnification for **intentional illegal acts**, the clause should be revised for clarity.

Here’s how it relates to the query:

### **Relevance to Violation of Law:**
1. **Scope of Indemnification (Section 12.1):**  
   - The clause requires the Indemnitor to defend and indemnify the Indemnitee against claims arising from:  
     - **Breach of contractual obligations (12.1(a))**: If a party violates a law that is incorporated into the agreement (e.g., through warranties, compliance covenants, or applicable law clauses), a breach of the agreement could trigger indemnification.  
     - **Negligence or fault (12.1(b))**: If a party’s violation of law (e.g., regulatory non-compliance) results in personal injury or property damage due to negligence, indemnification would apply.  
     - **IP infringement (12.1(c))**: While not directly about ""violation of law,"" IP infringement is a legal violation, so this subsection explicitly covers one type of legal breach.  

2. **Limitations (Section 12.2):**  
   - The clause **excludes liability for indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., fines or penalties imposed by regulators, unless they qualify as direct damages under 12.1).  
   - If a **violation of law** leads to a claim falling under 12.1 (e.g., breach of a compliance warranty), indemnification would apply. Otherwise, liability may be limited.  

### **Key Consideration:**  
The clause **does not explicitly mention ""violation of law""** but covers legal violations indirectly through:  
- **Breach of contract** (if the agreement includes legal compliance obligations).  
- **Negligence** (if the violation arises from negligent acts).  
- **IP infringement** (a subset of legal violations).  

For broader coverage of statutory/regulatory violations, the agreement should include:  
- An **express warranty of compliance with laws**.  
- A **specific indemnity for fines/penalties** (if intended).  

### **Conclusion:**  
This indemnification clause **partially addresses violations of law** but is limited to claims tied to contractual breaches, negligence, or IP infringement. To ensure coverage for all legal violations, the agreement should be amended to explicitly include them.

seller-favorable indemnification clauses,ab20fdf3c5,"11. Indemnity; limitation of liability. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from and against all claims, demands, actions, penalties, fines, damages, losses, expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs), known or unknown bodily and personal injuries or death or property damage and the consequences thereof, and liabilities of any kind (together, “Claims”) related to any Goods sold to Buyer by Seller or any Services performed by Seller for Buyer, except to the extent such Claims arise out of Buyer’s gross negligence, Buyer’s intentional misconduct, or Buyer’s improper storage or handling of Goods. Seller must defend Buyer in any actions or legal proceedings arising out of Claims with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. This indemnification obligation will survive Seller’s delivery of Goods or furnishing of Services to Buyer. The amount of Seller’s insurance in no way limits Seller’s indemnification obligations. Mutual indemnification on food especially – limitation of liability","This indemnification clause is **seller-favorable** in several key ways, despite appearing to impose obligations on the seller. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### **1. Narrow Exceptions for Buyer Liability**  
The clause carves out **limited exceptions** where the seller is *not* required to indemnify the buyer (e.g., buyer’s gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or improper handling). This shifts most liability to the seller, but the exceptions are narrowly defined, making it harder for the buyer to avoid responsibility in ambiguous cases.  

### **2. Broad Indemnification Scope**  
The seller must cover **""all claims, demands, actions... of any kind""** related to goods/services, including **unknown injuries or damages**. This is extremely broad and could expose the seller to unforeseen liabilities, even if the buyer shares some fault (unless it meets the high bar of ""gross negligence"" or ""intentional misconduct"").  

### **3. Defense Obligation with Buyer Control**  
The seller must defend the buyer **with counsel ""reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.""** This gives the buyer influence over legal strategy, potentially increasing costs for the seller.  

### **4. No Insurance Limitation**  
The clause explicitly states that the seller’s **insurance coverage does not cap indemnification obligations**, meaning the seller could be liable beyond policy limits—a significant risk.  

### **5. Survival Beyond Delivery**  
The indemnity obligation **survives delivery**, meaning the seller remains liable indefinitely for claims arising later (e.g., latent defects).  

### **Why It’s Seller-Favorable?**  
While the clause imposes heavy obligations on the seller, it is **favorable to the seller** in the sense that:  
- It avoids mutual indemnification (except for food, which is vaguely referenced).  
- It does not include **buyer indemnification of the seller**, which would typically appear in a balanced clause.  
- The exceptions for buyer liability are strict, leaving the seller exposed to most risks.  

### **Suggested Improvements for Seller Protection**  
To make it *more* seller-favorable, the clause could:  
1. **Cap liability** (e.g., to the contract value or insurance limits).  
2. **Exclude consequential/punitive damages**.  
3. **Shorten the survival period** for claims.  
4. **Require buyer cooperation** in defense.  
5. **Clarify mutual indemnity** (if intended for food).  

This clause heavily favors the buyer in its current form, but its one-sided nature could be seen as ""seller-favorable"" if the seller has superior bargaining power and expects to control risks tightly. However, it lacks typical seller protections (like liability caps).

seller-favorable indemnification clauses,53c738132b,"INDEMNIFICATION: Buyer will indemnify and hold Seller, its Affiliates, and Seller’s Agents harmless against any losses, damages, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees), which Seller, its Affiliates, or Seller’s Agents may incur or for which Seller, its Affiliates, or Seller’s Agents may become liable, arising out of the wrongful or negligent acts or omissions of Buyer, of its employees, officers, or directors, or of Buyer’s Agents in connection with any contract of which these General Terms and Conditions are a part.

GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these General Terms and Conditions or in any contract of which these General Terms and Conditions are a part, each Party will bear full responsibility, without limit, and in no event will be required to indemnify the other for, any gross negligence or willful misconduct attributable to its managerial or senior supervisory personnel.","This indemnification clause is **seller-favorable** in several key ways, aligning with the query's focus on provisions that protect the seller. Here’s how:

### 1. **Symmetrical but Narrower Seller Protections**  
   - While the clause appears balanced (both parties indemnify each other), the **scope of indemnifiable acts** favors the seller:  
     - **Buyer’s indemnity obligation** covers ""wrongful or negligent acts or omissions"" of **Buyer, its employees, officers, directors, or Buyer’s Agents** (broad coverage).  
     - **Seller’s indemnity obligation** is identical in structure but may be less impactful in practice if the seller’s operations (or its agents) are less likely to trigger claims compared to the buyer’s actions.  

### 2. **Exclusion for Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct**  
   - The **""Gross Negligence and Willful Misconduct"" carve-out** benefits the seller by:  
     - Shifting **unlimited liability** to each party for their own senior personnel’s egregious acts.  
     - This protects the seller from catastrophic claims (e.g., fraud or reckless behavior by its leadership) while still preserving indemnity for ordinary negligence by lower-level employees or agents.  

### 3. **Procedural Advantages for Seller**  
   - The seller is indemnified not just for its own losses but also for liabilities it **""may become liable""** to third parties (e.g., lawsuits arising from buyer’s negligence). This is critical for risk allocation.  
   - **Attorney fees** are explicitly included, reducing the seller’s litigation costs.  

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:  
- The clause ensures the buyer bears responsibility for a wide range of its own actions (and those of its agents), while the seller’s exposure is capped for severe misconduct by its leadership.  
- The symmetrical language masks the practical tilt: sellers often have more control over contract performance risks, making the buyer’s indemnity obligations more likely to be invoked.  

**Key Takeaway:** The clause is seller-favorable due to its broad indemnity trigger for buyer acts, coupled with protections against unlimited liability for the seller’s worst-case scenarios.",5
seller-favorable indemnification clauses,a5221603e5,"ARTICLE 8. INDEMNIFICATION
8.1 Indemnification by the Suppliers Each of the Suppliers shall, with respect to Products supplied by such Supplier, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the relevant Supplier), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the relevant Supplier arising from such claims.

The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the Company, or (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the Company.","This indemnification clause is **seller-favorable** (i.e., favorable to the Suppliers) in several key ways, aligning with the query's focus on protections for sellers (Suppliers). Here’s how:

### **1. Narrow Scope of Supplier Liability**  
The Suppliers’ indemnification obligations (Section 8.1) are limited to specific scenarios:  
- **IP infringement** or **misappropriation** claims tied to the Product itself.  
- **Product liability claims** stemming from **manufacturing defects**.  

The clause **excludes** claims arising from:  
- Modifications by the Company or third parties (i).  
- Unapproved combinations/uses of the Product (ii).  
- The Company’s own fault (iii).  

This shields Suppliers from broader liability, placing responsibility on the Company for misuse or external factors.

### **2. Control Over Settlements**  
- Suppliers must **approve any settlements** (Section 8.1: ""settlement agreed to by the relevant Supplier""). This prevents the Company from unilaterally settling claims and charging costs back to the Suppliers.  
- In contrast, the Company’s indemnity (Section 8.2) similarly requires its approval for settlements, but the asymmetry favors Suppliers by limiting their exposure.  

### **3. Reciprocal but Asymmetric Obligations**  
While the Company also indemnifies Suppliers (Section 8.2), the Suppliers’ obligations are narrower:  
- The Company’s indemnity covers the **same categories** (IP and manufacturing defects), but Suppliers are only liable for claims **not covered under Section 8.1**.  
- The exclusions for Suppliers (e.g., modifications, combinations, Company fault) are **not mirrored equally** against the Company, implying Suppliers retain more protection.  

### **4. Supplier-Centric Exclusions**  
The carve-outs (i–iii) in Section 8.1 ensure Suppliers avoid liability for risks outside their control (e.g., downstream modifications by the Company). This is a **pro-seller** drafting technique.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **seller-favorable** because:  
- It **limits Suppliers’ liability** to core issues (manufacturing/IP).  
- Gives Suppliers **control over dispute resolution**.  
- **Excludes liability** for actions taken by the Company or third parties.  
- Maintains asymmetry in obligations, favoring Suppliers.  

For a **buyer-favorable** version, the exclusions would be narrower, and the Company might seek broader indemnity coverage from Suppliers.",5

9.1 Limited Liability EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM BREACHES OF A PARTY'S CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE NON-DISCLOSURE CLAUSE IN SECTION 12.17 OF THE CHINA JV OPERATING AGREEMENT, BREACHES OF LICENSE GRANTS CONTAINED HEREIN, AND EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES TO FULFILL INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS DESCRIBED IN ARTICLE 8,
(A) IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHERS, OR TO ANY PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH OR UNDER THE OTHER, FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS ARTICLE 9 IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BARGAIN AND ABSENT THIS ARTICLE 9 THE ECONOMIC AND OTHER TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT.","This indemnification clause is **seller-favorable** (i.e., favorable to the Suppliers) in several key ways, aligning with the query's focus on protections for sellers (Suppliers). Here’s how:

### **1. Narrow Scope of Supplier Indemnification (8.1)**  
The Suppliers’ indemnity obligations are limited to specific scenarios:  
   - **IP infringement** or **misappropriation** claims (only for their own Products).  
   - **Product liability claims** (only for manufacturing defects).  

**Exclusions favor Suppliers** by carving out liability for:  
   - Modifications by the Company or third parties (i).  
   - Unapproved combinations/uses (ii).  
   - The Company’s own fault (iii).  

This shifts risk to the Company for issues outside the Suppliers’ direct control.

---

### **2. Broad Company Indemnification (8.2)**  
The Company must indemnify Suppliers for the **same categories of claims** (IP and product liability) **unless the Suppliers are already obligated to cover them under 8.1**. This creates a **backstop for Suppliers**, ensuring they are rarely left exposed.  

---

### **3. Liability Caps (9.1)**  
The **limitation of liability** clause further protects Suppliers by:  
   - **Excluding consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) (A).  
   - **Capping total liability** at **12 months of payments** for the affected Products (B).  
   - Explicitly stating these terms are a **""bargained-for"" essential term**, making it harder for courts to invalidate them.  

This shields Suppliers from catastrophic financial exposure, even if they breach the agreement (except for confidentiality/IP breaches).  

---

### **Why It’s Seller-Favorable**  
- **Suppliers’ obligations are narrowly defined**, while the Company’s are broader.  
- **Suppliers avoid liability for downstream modifications or misuse**.  
- **Financial exposure is capped**, even for indemnifiable claims.  

**Key Takeaway:** The clause minimizes Suppliers’ risk while ensuring the Company bears responsibility for most third-party claims, especially those arising from its own actions or combinations with other products.

seller-favorable indemnification clauses,f9b586910b,"10.1 Subject to the Distributor fulfilling all the conditions in this clause 10, the Supplier shall indemnify the Distributor, defend and hold harmless against any liability incurred by the Distributor in respect of damage to property, death or personal injury arising from any fault or defect in the design of the Products and any reasonable costs, claims, demands and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in connection with that liability (Relevant Claim), except to the extent the liability arises as a result of the wilful misconduct of the Distributor. The Supplier shall add the distributor to their current insurance certificate.","This indemnification clause is **seller-favorable** (or **Supplier-favorable** in this context) because it places the primary burden of liability on the Supplier while providing protections for the Distributor, subject to specific conditions. Here’s how it aligns with a seller-favorable approach:

### Key Seller-Favorable Elements:
1. **Conditional Indemnification**:  
   - The Supplier’s obligation to indemnify the Distributor is contingent on the Distributor fulfilling all conditions in Clause 10. This allows the Supplier to limit exposure if the Distributor fails to meet requirements (e.g., proper use of Products, reporting defects).

2. **Narrow Scope of Covered Claims**:  
   - The Supplier only indemnifies for liabilities tied to **fault/defect in the Product’s design**, excluding issues arising from the Distributor’s **wilful misconduct**. This shields the Supplier from broader liabilities (e.g., Distributor’s negligence or operational errors).

3. **Insurance Requirement**:  
   - The Supplier must add the Distributor to its insurance certificate, which transfers risk to the Supplier’s insurer rather than the Supplier directly. This is favorable to the Supplier because it leverages insurance coverage to mitigate potential indemnification costs.

4. **Defense Obligation**:  
   - The Supplier must **defend** the Distributor against claims, reducing the Distributor’s legal burden. This is typically more favorable to the indemnified party (Distributor), but here it’s balanced by the narrow triggers for indemnification.

5. **Exclusion for Distributor Misconduct**:  
   - The clause explicitly excludes indemnification for liabilities caused by the Distributor’s **wilful misconduct**, further limiting the Supplier’s exposure.

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:
- The Supplier retains control over the scope of indemnifiable claims (design defects only).  
- The Distributor’s right to indemnification is conditional, not absolute.  
- The Supplier’s insurance absorbs risk, reducing direct financial liability.  
- Broad exclusions (e.g., wilful misconduct) protect the Supplier from the Distributor’s actions.  

### Contrast with Buyer-Favorable Terms:
A **buyer-favorable** clause would typically:  
- Expand indemnification to cover **all** claims related to the Products (not just design defects).  
- Remove conditions on the indemnified party (Distributor).  
- Include **uncapped liability** or broader insurance requirements.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is **pro-Supplier** because it narrowly defines indemnifiable risks, imposes conditions on the Distributor, and relies on insurance to limit the Supplier’s direct liability. It balances protection for the Distributor while favoring the Supplier’s interests.

buyer-favorable indemnification clauses,ab20fdf3c5,"11. Indemnity; limitation of liability. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from and against all claims, demands, actions, penalties, fines, damages, losses, expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs), known or unknown bodily and personal injuries or death or property damage and the consequences thereof, and liabilities of any kind (together, “Claims”) related to any Goods sold to Buyer by Seller or any Services performed by Seller for Buyer, except to the extent such Claims arise out of Buyer’s gross negligence, Buyer’s intentional misconduct, or Buyer’s improper storage or handling of Goods. Seller must defend Buyer in any actions or legal proceedings arising out of Claims with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. This indemnification obligation will survive Seller’s delivery of Goods or furnishing of Services to Buyer. The amount of Seller’s insurance in no way limits Seller’s indemnification obligations. Mutual indemnification on food especially – limitation of liability","This **indemnification clause** is highly **buyer-favorable** due to several key provisions that heavily protect the buyer while imposing broad obligations on the seller. Below is an analysis of how this clause aligns with the query on **buyer-favorable indemnification clauses**:

### **1. Broad Scope of Indemnification**  
- The seller must indemnify the buyer against **all claims, demands, damages, losses, expenses (including legal fees), injuries, and liabilities** related to the goods or services provided.  
- The only exceptions are claims arising from the buyer’s **gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or improper storage/handling**—meaning the seller bears liability in nearly all other scenarios.  

### **2. Defense Obligation**  
- The seller must **defend the buyer** in any legal proceedings related to claims, using **counsel approved by the buyer** (giving the buyer control over legal strategy).  

### **3. Survival Clause**  
- The indemnification obligation **continues indefinitely** after delivery of goods/services, ensuring long-term protection for the buyer.  

### **4. No Insurance Limitation**  
- The clause explicitly states that the **seller’s insurance coverage does not limit their indemnification obligations**, meaning the buyer can seek full recovery beyond insurance limits.  

### **5. Mutual Indemnification (Food-Specific)**  
- The mention of **""mutual indemnification on food especially""** suggests that in food-related transactions, both parties may share liability, but the rest of the clause heavily favors the buyer by making the seller primarily responsible.  

### **Why This is Buyer-Favorable:**  
- **Minimal Exceptions for Buyer Liability** – The buyer is only excluded from indemnification in cases of gross misconduct, not ordinary negligence.  
- **Seller Bears Most Risks** – Even unknown or unforeseen claims (""known or unknown"") are covered.  
- **Buyer Controls Legal Defense** – The seller must use buyer-approved counsel.  
- **No Financial Cap** – The seller’s insurance limits do not restrict their liability.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause is **strongly buyer-favorable** because it imposes **near-unconditional indemnification obligations** on the seller while limiting the buyer’s exposure. It ensures the buyer is protected from almost all legal and financial risks arising from the seller’s goods or services.

However, it does contain some nuances that could be adjusted to make it more favorable to the Buyer. Below is an analysis of its relevance to the query:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **Mutual Indemnification**  
   - Both Buyer and Seller agree to indemnify each other for losses arising from their respective **wrongful or negligent acts or omissions** (including those of their employees, officers, directors, or agents).  
   - This is standard in contracts and does not inherently favor either party.

2. **Exclusion for Gross Negligence & Willful Misconduct**  
   - The clause explicitly states that **neither party** is required to indemnify the other for **gross negligence or willful misconduct by managerial/senior personnel**.  
   - This is a **neutral provision**, protecting both sides from extreme misconduct.

### **Why This is Not Buyer-Favorable:**
- **No Caps or Limitations on Buyer’s Liability** – The Buyer’s indemnification obligation is **unlimited**, meaning they could be exposed to significant liability.  
- **No Carve-Outs for Seller’s Negligence** – The clause does not exclude indemnification for losses caused **solely by Seller’s negligence**, which is sometimes negotiated in buyer-favorable terms.  
- **No Time or Monetary Limits** – Some buyer-favorable clauses include:  
  - **Monetary caps** on indemnification obligations.  
  - **Time limits** (e.g., indemnification claims must be made within 12 months).  
  - **Exclusions for indirect/consequential damages**.  

### **How to Make It More Buyer-Favorable:**
If the Buyer wants a more favorable position, they could negotiate:  
1. **Narrower Indemnification Scope** – Limit indemnity to **only third-party claims** (not first-party losses).  
2. **Higher Burden for Seller’s Indemnity** – Require Seller to indemnify for **strict liability or broader breaches** (e.g., IP infringement, regulatory violations).  
3. **Exclude Indemnity for Seller’s Ordinary Negligence** – Only require Seller to indemnify for **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  
4. **Add a Monetary Cap** – Limit Buyer’s indemnification exposure to a fixed amount (e.g., contract value).  
5. **Shorter Survival Period** – Require indemnification claims to be made within a short timeframe (e.g., 6-12 months post-contract).  

### **Conclusion:**  
The current clause is **neutral**, not buyer-favorable. To shift the balance, the Buyer should seek modifications that **limit their liability exposure** while **expanding Seller’s obligations**.",5
buyer-favorable indemnification clauses,a5221603e5,"ARTICLE 8. INDEMNIFICATION
8.1 Indemnification by the Suppliers Each of the Suppliers shall, with respect to Products supplied by such Supplier, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the relevant Supplier), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the relevant Supplier arising from such claims.

8.2 Indemnification by the Company Other than claims for which the Suppliers are obligated to indemnify the Company under Section 8.1, the Company shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Suppliers from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the Company), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product supplied by such Supplier infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the Company arising from such claims.

Here’s how:

### **1. Broad Supplier Indemnity Obligations (Buyer Protection)**  
- **Scope of Claims**: The Suppliers must indemnify the Company for:  
  - **IP infringement** (Section 8.1(a)) and **product liability claims** (Section 8.1(b)) arising from manufacturing defects.  
  - This shifts significant legal and financial risk to the Suppliers, protecting the buyer from third-party lawsuits.  
- **Covered Costs**: Includes attorneys' fees, settlements (if approved by the Supplier), and court-awarded damages, reducing the buyer’s potential out-of-pocket expenses.  

### **2. Narrow Exceptions Favoring the Buyer**  
The Supplier’s indemnity obligation **excludes** claims only if they **solely** arise from:  
  - Buyer modifications (**unless done by the Supplier**).  
  - Buyer’s combination with other products (**unless approved by the Supplier**).  
  - Buyer’s own fault.  
This places the burden on Suppliers to prove the buyer’s exclusive fault, making it harder for Suppliers to avoid liability.  

### **3. Limited Reciprocal Obligations for the Buyer**  
- The Company’s indemnity to Suppliers (Section 8.2) is narrower:  
  - It **excludes claims already covered under Section 8.1**, ensuring no double obligation for the buyer.  
  - The exceptions mirror the Supplier’s (e.g., modifications by others), but the buyer retains control over approvals for combinations/uses.  

### **4. Control Over Settlements**  
- Suppliers must obtain the Company’s approval for settlements (implied by ""approved by the relevant Supplier""), but the Company has no such requirement when indemnifying Suppliers. This gives the buyer leverage in dispute resolution.  

### **Why It’s Buyer-Favorable**  
- **Risk Allocation**: Suppliers bear most liability for defects/IP issues, even if the buyer’s actions are partially involved (unless solely at fault).  
- **Financial Protection**: Broad coverage of legal costs and damages shields the buyer.  
- **Asymmetry**: The buyer’s obligations are more constrained than the Suppliers’.  

**Suggested Enhancements for Even Stronger Buyer Protection**:  
- Explicitly require Suppliers to **reimburse pre-approved legal costs** upfront.  
- Add **survival periods** for indemnity obligations post-contract.  
- Clarify that Suppliers must indemnify **even if the buyer’s negligence is contributory** (unless gross/willful).

Below is an analysis of its relevance to the query:

### **Buyer-Favorable Aspects:**
1. **Broad Supplier Indemnity (Section 8.1)**  
   - The suppliers must indemnify the Company for:  
     - IP infringement claims related to their products.  
     - Product liability claims arising from manufacturing defects.  
   - Coverage includes legal costs, settlements (if approved by the supplier), and court-awarded damages.  
   - This shifts significant risk to the suppliers, which is favorable to the buyer.

2. **Narrow Exclusions for Supplier Liability**  
   The supplier’s indemnity does **not** apply only if the claim arises **solely** from:  
   - Buyer modifications (without supplier approval).  
   - Buyer’s improper combination/use of the product.  
   - Buyer’s own fault.  
   - This means the supplier remains liable in mixed-fault scenarios unless the buyer is **entirely** at fault.

3. **Limited Supplier Protections in Section 8.2**  
   - The Company’s indemnity to suppliers is **narrower**, mirroring Section 8.1 but only applying where suppliers are **not** already obligated to indemnify.  
   - This asymmetry favors the buyer by keeping supplier obligations broader.

4. **No Cap on Indemnifiable Claims (vs. General Liability Cap in Section 9.1)**  
   - While **general liability** is capped (e.g., no indirect/consequential damages, 12-month revenue limit), **indemnification claims under Article 8 are explicitly excluded from this cap**.  
   - This means the buyer can recover **full indemnifiable losses** (e.g., third-party IP infringement judgments) without being restricted by the liability cap.

### **Balancing Provisions (Limiting Buyer-Favorability):**
1. **Supplier Approval for Settlements**  
   - Suppliers must approve settlements (Section 8.1), preventing the buyer from unilaterally binding them to unfavorable terms.  

2. **Mutual Liability Cap (Section 9.1)**  
   - While indemnification claims are uncapped, **other liabilities** (e.g., breach of contract) are severely restricted (no lost profits, indirect damages, and a 12-month revenue cap).  
   - This protects suppliers from excessive exposure outside indemnification scenarios.

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause is **moderately buyer-favorable** because:  
- It imposes broad indemnification duties on suppliers for high-risk claims (IP, product liability).  
- It excludes indemnification from general liability caps, allowing full recovery for third-party claims.  
- The buyer’s indemnity obligations are narrower.  

However, it balances this with:  
- Supplier control over settlements.  
- A strict liability cap for non-indemnification claims.  

**For a more buyer-favorable clause**, the buyer could push for:  
- Removal of supplier settlement approval rights.  
- Broader indemnity coverage (e.g., including claims arising from buyer-approved combinations/modifications).  
- Weakening or removing the general liability cap entirely.

### **1. Broad Indemnification by Accuray (Seller-Favorable to Distributor)**
   - **Scope of Coverage**: Accuray (the seller/manufacturer) agrees to indemnify the Distributor (buyer) for:
     - **IP Infringement** (patents, copyrights, trade secrets) in key jurisdictions (U.S., Germany, or the delivery country) (Section 10.1).
     - **Product Liability** claims if the product is unsafe when used as intended per Accuray’s specifications (Section 10.2).
   - **Defense Obligation**: Accuray must **defend or settle** claims at its own cost, not just reimburse the Distributor.
   - **Financial Protection**: Covers liability, damages, **attorneys' fees, and settlement costs**—shifting risk entirely to Accuray.

### **2. Conditions for Indemnification Are Reasonable**
   The Distributor only needs to:
   - Give **prompt notice** of claims.
   - Let Accuray **control the defense** (avoiding conflicts).
   - Provide **reasonable assistance** (at Accuray’s expense).  
   These are standard and not overly burdensome.

### **3. Limited Indemnification from Distributor (Buyer)**
   - The Distributor’s indemnity (Section 10.6) is **narrower**, covering only:
     - Its own **misconduct** (acts outside the agreement).
     - **Misrepresentations** about the products (not defects or inherent risks).  
   - This asymmetry favors the Distributor (buyer) by limiting its exposure.

### **4. No Unilateral Settlements**
   - Accuray **cannot be bound** by settlements the Distributor makes without its consent, protecting both parties from rogue decisions.

### **Why This is Buyer-Favorable**
- The **buyer (Distributor)** gets strong protection for **third-party claims** (IP, safety) without assuming broad liability.
- The **seller (Accuray)** bears most of the risk, which is typical in supplier-distributor agreements where the manufacturer has more control over product design and compliance.
- The Distributor’s obligations are **minimal and procedural**, while Accuray’s are **substantive and financial**.

### **Potential Improvements for Even More Buyer-Favorability**
- Expand indemnity to cover **all jurisdictions** (not just U.S., Germany, and delivery country).
- Include **indemnity for regulatory compliance issues** (e.g., FDA violations).
- Remove ""sole control"" to allow Distributor to participate in defense if desired.

This clause is **pro-buyer (Distributor)** because it provides strong indemnity coverage while limiting the buyer’s obligations.",5

(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","This clause is highly relevant to the **""disclaimer of indirect damages""** query, as it explicitly addresses the limitation of liability for indirect or consequential damages between the parties. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Explicit Disclaimer of Indirect Damages (Clause 11.03)**  
   - The clause states that **neither party will be liable** for:  
     - Consequential, indirect, special, incidental, or punitive damages.  
     - Specific examples include lost profits, business interruption, loss of goodwill, or increased costs.  
   - The disclaimer applies **regardless of the legal theory** (contract, tort, strict liability) and even if the risk was foreseeable.  
   - This aligns with the query by clearly excluding liability for indirect damages, which are often harder to quantify and more contentious in disputes.

### 2. **Broad Liability Waiver (Clause 11.02)**  
   - The disclosing party disclaims liability for **any loss or damage** (excluding third-party claims) arising from the receiving party’s use of provided materials, **even if caused by negligence**.  
   - This reinforces the disclaimer of indirect damages by emphasizing that the receiving party assumes the risk of reliance on the disclosed information.  

### 3. **Exceptions (Clause 11.04)**  
   The limitations **do not apply** to:  
   - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (e.g., intentional harm or reckless disregard).  
   - **Third-party claims** (preserving indemnity rights under law).  
   This ensures the disclaimer doesn’t shield parties from egregious conduct or external legal obligations.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The clause **broadly disclaims indirect damages** (11.03) and reinforces it with a general negligence waiver (11.02).  
- It carves out **narrow exceptions** for extreme misconduct or third-party claims (11.04), balancing risk allocation.  
- The language is **comprehensive**, covering common indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) and preemptively addressing foreseeability arguments.  

This structure is typical in contracts to **limit exposure to unpredictable, disproportionate losses** while preserving accountability for direct harms or intentional wrongdoing.",5

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **Disclaimer of Indirect/Consequential Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party (nor their affiliates, officers, etc.) will be liable for:  
     - **Special**, **indirect**, **punitive**, **incidental**, or **consequential damages** (the types of damages queried).  
     - This applies regardless of the legal basis (contract, tort, negligence, statutory duty, etc.).  
     - The exclusion applies even if the damages were **foreseeable** or the party was **advised of the risk**.  

2. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**:  
   - The limitation **does not apply** to:  
     - **Indemnification obligations** under Article 10 (Confidentiality) or Sections 16.1/16.2 (indemnities for third-party claims).  
     - Acts of **gross negligence** or **willful misconduct** (where liability for indirect damages may still arise).  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause is a **broad exclusion of liability for indirect/consequential damages**, which aligns with the query’s focus.  
- It clarifies that while **direct damages** (e.g., breach-related losses) may still be recoverable, **secondary losses** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or downstream impacts) are excluded unless they fall under the exceptions (indemnities or misconduct).  
- The language is **comprehensive**, covering all legal theories (contract, tort, etc.) and emphasizing the parties’ intent to limit exposure to unpredictable or disproportionate losses.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Protects both parties** from being sued for unforeseeable or disproportionate losses.  
- **Preserves indemnification rights** for third-party claims (e.g., breaches of confidentiality).  
- **Maintains accountability** for intentional or egregious misconduct (gross negligence/willful acts).  

In summary, this clause is a **standard but robust disclaimer of indirect damages** with carefully carved-out exceptions, providing legal certainty to the parties.",5

Here’s how it functions and why it’s relevant:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for:  
   - **Consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or enhanced damages**  
   - **Lost profits, lost revenues, or diminution in value**  
   These are all categories of damages that do not flow directly from a breach but are secondary or ripple effects (e.g., lost business opportunities due to a delayed product delivery).

2. **Broad Application**:  
   The disclaimer applies to **any breach of the agreement or claim under it**, regardless of:  
   - Whether the damages were **foreseeable** (eliminating arguments based on foreseeability under contract law).  
   - Whether a party was **warned** about the possibility of such damages.  
   - The **legal theory** (contract, tort, or otherwise) behind the claim.  

3. **Exception for Third-Party Indemnification**:  
   The only carve-out is for **indemnification obligations under Section 9** (likely covering third-party claims like IP infringement or personal injury). This means indirect damages may still apply in those specific scenarios.

### **Relevance to Your Query:**
- The clause **limits liability** by ensuring that neither party can sue for **indirect or consequential losses** (e.g., lost profits due to a breach).  
- It strengthens legal predictability by **waiving claims** based on theories like negligence or tort, focusing liability only on **direct damages**.  
- The **exception for indemnification** shows that the parties still accept some risk for third-party claims, but not between themselves.  

### **Practical Impact:**
- A business harmed by a breach could only recover **direct damages** (e.g., cost of replacement services) but not **lost future revenue**.  
- Courts generally enforce such disclaimers if clearly worded (as here), unless unconscionable or against public policy.

Here’s how it aligns with your query:

### Key Relevance to Indirect Damages:
1. **Broad Disclaimer of Liability**:  
   The clause states that neither party (LBIO, MD Anderson, or their affiliates) will be liable for **""indirect or consequential damages""** (among other types). This includes losses like lost profits, lost opportunities, or lost revenue—classic examples of indirect damages that flow from a breach but are not directly caused by it.

2. **Specific Exclusions**:  
   The disclaimer carves out exceptions where liability for indirect damages may still apply, such as:  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (e.g., third-party claims).  
   - **Breaches of confidentiality/IP obligations** (protecting sensitive interests).  
   - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (to deter egregious behavior).  

3. **Purpose**:  
   The clause allocates risk by shielding parties from unpredictable, far-reaching financial consequences (e.g., downstream business losses) while preserving liability for direct harms or intentional wrongdoing. This is typical in contracts to promote fairness and limit exposure to open-ended damages.

### Why It Matters for Your Query:  
If you’re assessing enforceability or drafting a similar clause, this example demonstrates how to:  
- Clearly define excluded damages (e.g., indirect/consequential).  
- Balance protection with carve-outs for high-priority risks.  
- Use precise language (e.g., ""loss of revenue or profit"") to avoid ambiguity.

Here’s a breakdown of its key aspects:

### **1. Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**  
- **Scope of Exclusion**: Neither party will be liable for:  
  - **Indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits, lost revenue, business interruption, or data loss).  
  - **Incidental or consequential damages** (e.g., third-party claims or downstream losses).  
- **Exceptions**:  
  - Damages awarded to a third party in a judgment where indemnification applies (under **Section 7.2**).  
  - Damages arising from a breach of **Section 11.4 (Nondisclosure)**.  
  - **Liquidated damages** (as specified in **Section 10.5.2**).  
- **Legal Theories Covered**: The disclaimer applies regardless of the legal basis (contract, tort, negligence, product liability, etc.).  

### **2. Limitation of Total Liability (Section 8.3)**  
- **Cap on Liability**: Even for direct damages, neither party’s total liability (except for indemnification claims under **Section 7.2**) can exceed a specified amount (denoted as **[***]**).  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- This clause **protects both parties** from being held responsible for **hard-to-quantify, indirect losses** (e.g., lost profits) unless an exception applies.  
- It ensures that liability is **predictable and capped**, reducing financial risk in disputes.  
- The **exceptions (indemnity, confidentiality breaches, liquidated damages)** ensure that critical obligations remain enforceable.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This is a **strong disclaimer of indirect damages**, typical in commercial contracts to allocate risk fairly and avoid excessive liability exposure. If a party suffers **consequential losses** (e.g., lost business opportunities), they generally **cannot recover them** under this agreement unless an exception applies.

consequential damages waiver,0dd1d92b6d,"14. Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages. In any action or proceeding between the Parties (including any arbitration proceeding) arising under or with respect to this Agreement or in any manner pertaining to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or to the relationship of the Parties under this Agreement, each Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and releases any right, power or privilege either may have to claim or receive from the other Party any punitive or exemplary damages, each Party acknowledging and agreeing that the remedies herein provided and other remedies at law or in equity will in all circumstances be adequate. Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The clause you provided is a **""Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages""** and is directly relevant to the query on **consequential damages waiver**, though it primarily focuses on **punitive or exemplary damages** rather than consequential damages. Here’s how it relates:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Scope of Waiver**  
   - The clause waives **punitive or exemplary damages**, which are non-compensatory (i.e., not tied to actual losses but intended to punish or deter misconduct).  
   - While it does not explicitly mention ""consequential damages,"" such damages are typically **compensatory** (arising indirectly from a breach, e.g., lost profits). However, the clause emphasizes that remedies provided in the agreement (and at law/equity) are deemed ""adequate,"" which could implicitly limit broader claims, including consequential damages, depending on jurisdiction and interpretation.

2. **Intent of the Parties**  
   - The parties explicitly acknowledge they are experienced, negotiated the agreement with legal counsel, and understand the waiver. This strengthens enforceability.  
   - The waiver is **unconditional and irrevocable**, signaling a strong mutual intent to exclude non-compensatory claims.

3. **Gap in Coverage**  
   - If the query seeks a waiver of **consequential damages**, this clause does not expressly address them. A typical consequential damages waiver would explicitly state:  
     *""Neither party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages...""*  
   - To fully address the query, the clause would need expansion or a separate section covering consequential damages.

### Practical Implications:
- **Punitive Damages:** Clearly waived.  
- **Consequential Damages:** Not explicitly waived here, but the clause’s emphasis on ""adequate remedies"" could support an argument against them if the agreement elsewhere limits liability.  
- **Drafting Suggestion:** If consequential damages are a concern, a separate waiver should be added for clarity.

### Why It Matters for the Query:
While the clause aligns with the broader theme of limiting damages (responding to the spirit of the query), it does not fully satisfy a request for a **consequential damages waiver** unless interpreted expansively or combined with other provisions. For precise protection, explicit language on consequential damages is recommended.

9.5. Tort Claim Waiver. In addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this Article 9, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives any right to recover from the other party, and Customer waives any right to recover from any Eligible Provider, any economic losses or damages in any action brought under tort theories, including, misrepresentation, negligence and/or strict liability, and/or relating to the quality or performance of any products or services provided by Metavante. For purposes of this waiver, economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service except personal injury or damage to other tangible property. Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.
9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination. Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.
9.7. Essential Elements.

Here’s how the clause is relevant:

### 1. **Explicit Waiver of Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**  
   - The clause states that **neither party will be liable** for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including:
     - Lost profits  
     - Loss of business  
     - Other economic damages  
     - Injury to property  
   - This waiver applies **regardless of the legal theory** (contract, tort, negligence, etc.) and **even if the party was aware of the potential for such damages**.  
   - The language is **broad and absolute**, reinforcing that consequential damages are fully excluded.

### 2. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
   - Expands the waiver to **tort-based claims** (e.g., misrepresentation, negligence, strict liability).  
   - Specifically bars recovery of **economic losses** (e.g., monetary harm from defective products/services), except for personal injury or damage to tangible property.  
   - Clarifies that **even if contractual remedies fail**, tort claims for economic losses are still waived.  

### 3. **Severability & Essential Terms (Sections 9.2, 9.7)**  
   - The waiver is **independent and severable** from other provisions, ensuring it remains enforceable even if other parts of the agreement are invalidated.  
   - Both parties acknowledge these limitations are **essential to the agreement**, indicating they were a material bargaining point (likely favoring the service provider, Metavante).  

### 4. **Additional Protections**  
   - **Statute of Limitations (Section 9.4)**: Shortens the time frame to bring claims (2 years), further limiting liability exposure.  
   - **Liquidated Damages (Section 9.6)**: Prevents disputes over termination damages by pre-setting fees, avoiding arguments about consequential losses.  

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
The clause comprehensively **waives consequential damages** and related economic harms, protecting both parties (but especially Metavante) from unpredictable, indirect losses. It also:  
- Covers multiple legal theories (contract, tort).  
- Survives even if other remedies fail.  
- Is framed as a critical term of the agreement.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance to ""Consequential Damages Waiver"":
1. **Broad Waiver of Damages**:  
   The clause states that neither party will be liable to the other for **consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive damages, or lost profits/revenues** arising from the agreement or its breach. This is a comprehensive waiver of the types of damages often sought in disputes, particularly consequential damages (e.g., lost business opportunities or downstream losses).

2. **Exceptions Clarified**:  
   While the waiver is broad, it carves out an exception for **third-party claims**. If a third party (unaffiliated with either party) sues for damages (including consequential or punitive damages), the indemnification obligations under the agreement still apply. This ensures the waiver only applies to claims between the contracting parties, not external liabilities.

3. **Robust Protection Scope**:  
   The waiver applies **regardless of negligence or fault** (sole, joint, or concurrent) and covers both anticipated and unanticipated events. This strengthens the clause by preventing a party from circumventing the waiver by arguing negligence or unforeseen circumstances.

4. **Pre-Existing Conditions**:  
   The waiver explicitly covers liabilities tied to pre-existing conditions, further limiting exposure to historical risks.

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause is a **strong example of a consequential damages waiver** because:  
- It clearly defines the types of damages being waived (directly addressing ""consequential damages"").  
- It balances the waiver with carve-outs for third-party claims, which is common in commercial contracts.  
- It uses language (""notwithstanding... negligence"") to reinforce the waiver’s enforceability.  

**Practical Implication**: Parties agreeing to this clause are giving up the right to sue each other for most indirect or consequential losses, even if caused by the other party’s negligence, while preserving rights to defend against third-party claims. This allocates risk and limits liability exposure between the parties.

   - The clause states that **neither party will be liable** for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including:

     - Loss of business  
     - Other economic damages

   - This waiver applies **regardless of the legal theory** (contract, tort, negligence, etc.) and **even if the party was aware of the potential for such damages**.  
   - The language is **broad and absolute**, reinforcing that these damages are categorically excluded.

### 2. **Additional Protections Against Tort Claims (Section 9.5)**  
   - The parties **waive the right to recover economic losses** under tort theories (e.g., misrepresentation, negligence, strict liability).  
   - This reinforces the waiver of consequential damages by preventing circumvention through tort claims.  

### 3. **Severability and Independent Enforcement (Section 9.2)**  
   - The waiver is **independent of other provisions** and must be enforced separately, ensuring it remains effective even if other parts of the agreement are challenged.  

### 4. **Acknowledgment of Essentiality (Section 9.7)**  
   - Both parties acknowledge that these limitations are **fundamental to the agreement**, meaning courts are more likely to uphold them.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The clause **fully waives consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) in all scenarios, even in cases of breach or negligence.  
- It prevents parties from bypassing the waiver by suing under tort law instead of contract law.  
- The language is **strongly drafted** to maximize enforceability.

EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES UNDER SECTION 7.2 [Indemnity], NEITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL EXCEED [***].","This clause is directly relevant to the query about a **""consequential damages waiver""** because it explicitly limits the liability of both parties for **indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages** arising from the agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its key aspects:

### **1. Waiver of Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**  
- **Scope of Waiver**: Neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, lost revenue, business interruption, or data loss), even if they were advised of the possibility of such damages.  
- **Exceptions**:  
  - **Indemnification Claims (Section 7.2)**: If a third party sues and the indemnifying party is obligated to cover those damages.  
  - **Breach of Nondisclosure (Section 11.4)**: If the damages arise from a breach of confidentiality obligations.  
  - **Liquidated Damages (Section 10.5.2)**: The waiver does not prevent ACSI from claiming liquidated damages as specified elsewhere in the agreement.  

### **2. Limitation of Liability (Section 8.3)**  
- **Cap on Liability**: Even for direct damages, neither party’s total liability (except for indemnification claims) can exceed a specified amount (redacted as [***]).  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- This clause **waives consequential damages** in most cases, protecting both parties from unpredictable financial risks (e.g., lost profits due to delays or failures).  
- It **carves out exceptions** where consequential damages may still apply (e.g., indemnification scenarios or confidentiality breaches).  
- It also **imposes a financial cap** on overall liability, further limiting exposure.  

### **Practical Implications**  
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause shifts risk away from speculative or hard-to-quantify losses (like lost business opportunities).  
- **Contractual Certainty**: Both parties agree upfront that certain types of damages are excluded, reducing litigation risks.  
- **Negotiation Point**: The exceptions (e.g., indemnity, confidentiality) are areas where parties may negotiate broader or narrower liability.

(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","The query relates to **""incidental damages disclaimer""**, and the provided clause (Sections 11.02, 11.03, and 11.04) comprehensively addresses this issue by disclaiming liability for incidental damages and other related categories of damages. Here’s how the clause is relevant:

### 1. **Explicit Disclaimer of Incidental Damages (Section 11.03)**  
   - The clause explicitly states that **neither party will be liable** for **""incidental"" damages** (among other types like consequential, indirect, punitive, etc.).  
   - Incidental damages typically include secondary losses arising from a breach (e.g., costs incurred due to delays or disruptions). The clause broadly waives liability for these, even if the possibility of such damages was foreseeable.  
   - The only exceptions are breaches of confidentiality/restricted use provisions (Section 11.03) or gross negligence/willful misconduct (Section 11.04).

### 2. **General Liability Limitation (Section 11.02)**  
   - The disclosing party disclaims liability for **any loss or damage** (including incidental damages) resulting from the receiving party’s use of provided materials, even if caused by negligence.  
   - This reinforces the disclaimer by clarifying that the receiving party assumes all risks of reliance on the disclosed information.

### 3. **Exceptions (Section 11.04)**  
   - The disclaimer does **not** apply to:  
     - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (e.g., intentional harm or reckless disregard for obligations).  
     - **Third-party claims** where indemnity or contribution rights under law apply.  
   - This ensures the disclaimer does not override statutory or common-law liability for egregious conduct or third-party claims.

### **Key Relevance to the Query**  
The clause directly answers the query by:  
- **Explicitly disclaiming incidental damages** in Section 11.03.  
- **Broadening the disclaimer** to cover negligence-related claims (Section 11.02).  
- **Carving out exceptions** where liability remains (Section 11.04).  

This structure is typical in contracts to allocate risk, protect parties from unpredictable secondary losses, and comply with enforceability standards (e.g., ensuring disclaimers don’t shield intentional misconduct).

THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.","This clause is directly relevant to an **""incidental damages disclaimer""** because it explicitly disclaims liability for **incidental damages** (along with other indirect and consequential damages) and limits the types of recoverable losses a participant (or counterparty) may claim. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Elements Related to Incidental Damages:
1. **Explicit Disclaimer of Incidental Damages**:  
   - The clause states that the ""Released Parties"" (e.g., Samsung and its licensors) will **not** be liable for ""any indirect, incidental, consequential, [or] special... damages.""  
   - This includes a broad waiver of claims for **incidental damages**, which are secondary losses arising indirectly from a breach or event (e.g., costs incurred due to delays or disruptions).

2. **Waiver of Rights**:  
   - The participant agrees to waive **all rights** to seek incidental damages (among others), reinforcing the disclaimer’s enforceability.  
   - This prevents claims for losses that are not directly tied to the contract’s core purpose (e.g., lost time, incidental expenses).

3. **Limitation of Liability**:  
   - Even if incidental damages could theoretically apply, the clause caps total liability at the **lesser of actual loss or $1,000**, further negating recovery for such damages.  
   - The phrase ""maximum extent permitted by law"" signals intent to enforce the disclaimer strictly, even if remedies fail.

### Why It Matters for the Query:  
The clause is a **comprehensive disclaimer** targeting incidental damages (and related categories) to:  
- Protect the Released Parties from unpredictable or disproportionate liabilities.  
- Shift risk to the participant by excluding indirect losses.  
- Comply with common contractual practices where incidental damages are disclaimed unless expressly agreed.  

**Note:** Enforceability depends on jurisdiction (some laws may invalidate disclaimers for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or in consumer contracts). However, the clause is a strong example of a boilerplate incidental damages disclaimer.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Scope of Disclaimed Damages**  
The clause broadly disclaims liability for:  
- **Incidental damages** (explicitly mentioned)  
- Special, punitive, indirect, and consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, lost opportunity, or lost use).  

This aligns with the query by addressing **incidental damages** as part of a comprehensive exclusion of non-direct damages.

### 2. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**  
The disclaimer does **not** apply in three key scenarios:  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (e.g., third-party claims).  
   - **Breaches of confidentiality, non-use, or IP-related obligations**.  
   - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  

This means incidental damages *may still be recoverable* in these exceptional cases, narrowing the scope of the disclaimer.

### 3. **Legal Purpose**  
The clause protects the parties (LBIO, MD Anderson, and their affiliates) from unpredictable or disproportionate liabilities (like incidental losses) while preserving recourse for egregious conduct or specific contractual breaches.  

### **Why It Answers the Query**  
- It explicitly includes ""incidental damages"" in the list of disclaimed liabilities.  
- It clarifies when such damages *might still apply* (e.g., in cases of gross negligence).  
- It reflects standard risk allocation in contracts, shielding parties from secondary losses while allowing accountability for direct harms.  

**Key Takeaway:** The clause is a strong disclaimer of incidental damages but carves out exceptions for intentional misconduct, confidentiality/IP breaches, and indemnification claims.",5

Here’s how it relates:

### 1. **Exclusion of Incidental Damages**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims liability for **incidental damages** (alongside consequential, indirect, and other non-direct damages). Incidental damages typically include secondary losses arising from a breach (e.g., costs incurred to mitigate harm, such as storage fees for undelivered goods).  
   - By including ""incidental"" in the list of excluded damages, the clause ensures neither party can claim compensation for such losses, even if they result from a breach of the agreement.

### 2. **Scope of the Disclaimer**  
   - The disclaimer applies broadly to **all claims** related to the agreement, regardless of:  
     - **Foreseeability** (even if damages were predictable).  
     - **Notice** (even if the party was warned of potential damages).  
     - **Legal theory** (whether the claim is based on contract, tort, or other grounds).  
   - This creates a strong barrier against claims for incidental or other indirect losses.

### 3. **Key Exception**  
   - The exclusion **does not apply** to indemnification obligations for third-party claims under **Section 9**. This preserves liability for certain third-party claims (e.g., IP infringement or personal injury) where incidental damages might otherwise be recoverable.

### 4. **Relevance to Your Query**  
   - If your query seeks to understand how incidental damages are treated in contracts, this clause demonstrates a **standard approach**:  
     - Incidental damages are **categorically excluded** unless carve-outs (like indemnification) apply.  
     - The language is designed to override default rules under laws like the UCC (which may allow incidental damages in sales contracts).  

### Practical Implications  
- **Protection for Both Parties**: Limits exposure to unpredictable, disproportionate losses.  
- **Risk Allocation**: Shifts the risk of indirect/incidental damages to the party that might suffer them (e.g., requiring them to insure against such risks).

Here’s how it relates to your query:  

### **1. Definition of Incidental Damages**  
Incidental damages are secondary losses that arise indirectly from a breach of contract, such as additional costs incurred due to delays, lost time, or minor disruptions. They are distinct from direct damages (e.g., costs to replace defective goods) and consequential damages (e.g., lost profits).  

### **2. How the Clause Addresses Incidental Damages**  
The clause explicitly states that **neither party will be liable for**:  
- **Incidental damages** (alongside special, indirect, consequential, and exemplary damages)  
- **Unless an exception applies** (e.g., breaches of **Article 7**, **Section 8.1.5**, or certain indemnification obligations).  

### **3. Relevance to Your Query**  
- The clause **disclaims liability for incidental damages** in most cases, meaning neither party can claim compensation for such losses under the agreement.  
- However, it **carves out exceptions** (e.g., breaches of specific warranties or indemnification obligations), where liability for incidental damages may still apply.  

### **4. Practical Effect**  
- **Protection for Both Parties**: Limits exposure to unpredictable or excessive secondary losses.  
- **Risk Allocation**: Shifts the risk of incidental damages away from both parties unless certain serious breaches occur.

THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.","This clause is directly relevant to a **""disclaimer of lost profits""** because it explicitly excludes liability for lost profits, along with other types of indirect or consequential damages. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance to the query:

### 1. **Explicit Waiver of Lost Profits**  
   - The clause states that the ""Released Parties"" (e.g., Samsung and its licensors) will not be liable for **""lost profits""** or other indirect damages (e.g., consequential, incidental, punitive).  
   - The participant **waives all rights** to claim such damages, even if the possibility of these damages was known or foreseeable.  

### 2. **Broad Exclusion of Indirect Damages**  
   - The disclaimer covers not just lost profits but also other forms of economic harm (e.g., consequential, special, exemplary damages), reinforcing a strong limitation on liability.  
   - This is a common contractual safeguard to prevent claims for **business interruptions, missed opportunities, or downstream financial losses** that may arise from the agreement.  

### 3. **Cumulative Liability Cap**  
   - Even if a claim succeeds, the sponsor’s liability is strictly limited to the **lesser of actual loss or $1,000**, further minimizing exposure to financial risks.  
   - This reinforces the disclaimer by ensuring that **no claim can exceed a nominal amount**, effectively barring recovery for lost profits in practice.  

### 4. **Legal Reinforcement**  
   - The clause states that these exclusions apply **""to the maximum extent permitted by law,""** indicating an intent to enforce the disclaimer even if legal challenges arise.  
   - The phrase **""even if any remedy fails its essential purpose""** suggests that the waiver remains valid even if the contract’s primary compensation mechanism is deemed inadequate.  

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
If the query concerns whether lost profits can be claimed under this contract, the answer is **no**—this clause **explicitly disclaims liability** for them. It is a strong, comprehensive waiver designed to shield the sponsor (Samsung) from financial risks beyond direct, measurable losses.

While it does not explicitly mention ""lost profits,"" it is relevant to your query in the following ways:

1. **Implied Exclusion of Liability for Lost Profits**:  
   The clause disclaims all implied warranties, including ""merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose."" Courts often interpret such disclaimers as excluding liability for **consequential damages**, which typically include lost profits, unless expressly stated otherwise in the agreement.  

2. **No Additional Representations Beyond Express Terms**:  
   The clause states that neither party has made any representations or warranties beyond those ""expressly set forth"" in the listed agreements. If lost profits are not explicitly addressed elsewhere (e.g., in an indemnification or liability limitation clause), this disclaimer reinforces that neither party is guaranteeing protection against such losses.  

3. **Potential Impact on Claims**:  
   If a dispute arises and one party seeks lost profits, the other could argue that this disclaimer bars such claims—especially if the lost profits stem from reliance on implied warranties (e.g., the IP's fitness for a business purpose) rather than a breach of an express term.  

### Key Consideration:  
To fully assess the disclaimer's effect on lost profits, you would need to review:  
- The **entire agreement** (particularly any **limitation of liability** or **indemnification clauses**).  
- Whether lost profits are **expressly excluded** as a type of recoverable damage elsewhere.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Exclusion of Lost Profits**:  
   The clause states that neither party will be liable for **""claims for losses of commercial profits""** or **""business losses of the company or any third party.""** This means that if one party suffers lost profits due to the other party’s actions (or inactions) under the agreement, they cannot claim compensation for those losses, unless there’s a breach of confidentiality.

2. **Broad Protection Against Indirect Damages**:  
   The disclaimer covers **""indirect""** and **""punitive""** claims, reinforcing that lost profits (which are typically considered consequential/indirect damages) are excluded. This shields both parties from liability for financial harm that isn’t directly caused by a breach (e.g., downstream revenue loss).

3. **Legal Basis Clarification**:  
   The clause applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, or otherwise), meaning even if lost profits are claimed under negligence or other non-contractual grounds, they’re still excluded. The only exception is a breach of the confidentiality clause.

4. **Proactive Risk Allocation**:  
   By including this language, the parties agree upfront that they won’t hold each other responsible for unforeseeable or speculative losses like lost profits, which are often difficult to quantify. This promotes certainty in the contractual relationship.

This clause effectively disclaims liability for lost profits and other indirect business losses, protecting both parties from financial risks beyond direct damages—unless confidentiality is violated. It’s a strong example of a **limitation of liability** provision focused on economic harms.",5

Here’s how it is relevant:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that neither party (nor their affiliates) will be liable for **indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages**, including **loss of profits** or **business interruption**.  
   - This is a broad disclaimer covering most forms of economic harm that are not direct losses (e.g., lost revenue, missed opportunities, or downstream impacts).

2. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**:  
   The exclusion does *not* apply in the following cases:  
   - **Fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence** (subsection A).  
   - **Breach of confidentiality (Article 9) or exclusivity obligations (Section 5.8)** (subsection B).  
   - **Specific indemnified claims** (subsections C and D), such as third-party claims where indemnification is required.  

3. **Scope of Application**:  
   - The disclaimer applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, etc.) and even if the parties were aware such damages might occur.  
   - It covers damages arising from the agreement, the transactions contemplated, or the use of licensed products/compounds.

### Relevance to ""Disclaimer of Lost Profits"":
- The clause **carves out lost profits** as a category of damages that are *not recoverable* unless one of the exceptions (e.g., fraud, breach of confidentiality, or indemnified claims) applies.  
- This protects both parties from being sued for **consequential economic harm** (e.g., a company cannot claim compensation for lost revenue due to delays or failures under the agreement, unless the exception is triggered).  
- It aligns with common contractual risk allocation, where parties agree to limit liability to **direct damages** and exclude speculative or indirect losses like lost profits.

### Practical Implications:
- If a party suffers lost profits due to the other’s actions (e.g., a breach of contract), they generally **cannot recover those losses** unless the breach falls under the exceptions (e.g., gross negligence or a breach of exclusivity/confidentiality).  
- This clause shifts the risk of indirect losses to the aggrieved party, encouraging parties to mitigate potential damages themselves.

### 1. **Explicit Disclaimer of Economic Benefits (Including Lost Profits)**  
   - The clause explicitly states that neither party makes any representations or warranties about:  
     - **""The amount of sales revenues that may occur during the term""** (Section 8.1(A))  
     - **""Any economic or other benefit that they might obtain through its participation in this agreement""** (Section 8.1(B))  
   - This language effectively disclaims liability for **lost profits** or other unrealized economic gains, as it clarifies that neither party guarantees any financial outcomes beyond the specific payments outlined in the agreement.

### 2. **Waiver of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause disclaims **implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and those arising from trade usage or course of dealing).  
   - By waiving these, the parties prevent claims that might otherwise arise if one party alleges they entered the agreement expecting certain financial results (e.g., profits) that were not realized.  

### 3. **Narrowing Liability to Contractual Payments Only**  
   - The parenthetical **""(Other than the specific sums to be paid pursuant to this agreement)""** reinforces that the only financial obligations are those expressly stated in the contract.  
   - This excludes **consequential damages** (like lost profits) unless explicitly provided elsewhere in the agreement.  

### **Why This Matters for Lost Profits**  
- If one party suffers lost profits due to the other party’s actions (or inactions), this clause would likely **bar a claim for such damages**, as the parties have agreed that no warranties or guarantees exist regarding economic benefits beyond the contract’s express terms.  
- Courts often enforce such disclaimers unless there is fraud, gross negligence, or a statutory exception (e.g., consumer protection laws).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is a strong **limitation of liability** provision that shields both parties from claims related to lost profits or other unrealized economic expectations, unless the contract explicitly states otherwise.

The disclaimer applies broadly to liabilities **""in connection with or arising out of this Agreement or any Study Order.""** This means that, unless an exception applies, neither party can claim punitive damages for breaches or disputes related to the agreement.

### 3. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**  
The clause carves out three key situations where the disclaimer **does not apply**:  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (e.g., if one party agrees to cover certain third-party claims).  
   - **Breaches involving confidentiality, non-use, or intellectual property** (suggesting these areas are treated more strictly).  
   - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (punitive damages may still apply if a party acts with extreme recklessness or intent to harm).  

   This means punitive damages could still be sought in these exceptional cases.

### 4. **Practical Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **limits exposure** to punitive damages in most scenarios, protecting both parties from excessive liability.  
- It ensures that punitive damages are only available in cases of **intentional wrongdoing or specific breaches** (e.g., IP violations), aligning with common contractual risk allocation principles.  

### Conclusion  
This clause directly addresses the query by **disclaiming punitive damages** as part of a broader exclusion of non-compensatory damages, while preserving recourse for extreme misconduct or specific breaches. It balances risk mitigation with accountability for egregious acts.

disclaimer of punitive damages,f965fcf7d4,"7.4. DAMAGES. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 6.3, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS TERMINATION, WHETHER LIABILITY IS ASSERTED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. * * *","The clause you provided (Section 7.4) is directly relevant to the query about a **""disclaimer of punitive damages""** because it explicitly excludes liability for punitive damages, among other types of damages, under the agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Points Addressing the Query:
1. **Exclusion of Punitive Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party shall be liable for **""punitive damages""** arising from the agreement or its termination. This is a clear disclaimer of such damages, aligning with the query.

2. **Broad Scope of Liability Waiver**:  
   - The disclaimer applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, etc.), meaning punitive damages cannot be claimed even if one party alleges intentional harm or gross negligence (unless otherwise required by law).

3. **Carve-Out for Section 6.3**:  
   - The exclusion is subject to exceptions outlined in **Section 6.3** (which is not provided here). This implies there may be scenarios where punitive damages could apply, depending on what 6.3 covers (e.g., willful misconduct, fraud, or statutory exceptions).

4. **Preemptive Protection**:  
   - The phrase **""irrespective of whether such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages""** reinforces the parties’ intent to waive punitive damages even if they were foreseeable.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause is a **standard contractual tool** to limit exposure to unpredictable or excessive damages (like punitive damages, which are meant to punish egregious conduct rather than compensate for losses).  
- However, its enforceability may depend on jurisdiction. Some courts may refuse to enforce punitive damage waivers in cases involving **fraud, intentional harm, or violations of public policy**.  

### Practical Implications:
- **For the party seeking protection**: This clause shields them from punitive damages in most disputes under the agreement.  
- **For the counterparty**: They give up the right to claim punitive damages, even if the other party’s actions are reckless (unless Section 6.3 or applicable law overrides this).

NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS MADE REGARDING SUCH INFORMATION AND MATERIAL, OR ITS COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
11.03 Indirect or Enhanced Damages. In no event will either Party be liable to the other Party under this Agreement for any consequential, indirect, special, incidental, punitive or exemplary loss or damage, including, without limitation, business interruption, cost of capital, loss of anticipated revenues and profits, loss of goodwill or increased operating costs, whether arising from contract, warranty, tort, strict liability or otherwise regardless of whether the possibility of such losses or damages have been made known to the first Party, and each Party hereby expressly waives all such rights and remedies, except for breach of any confidentiality or restricted use provisions of this Agreement and except as provided in Paragraph 11.04 (Exceptions to Limitations of Liability).
11.04 Exceptions to Limitations of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party will bear full responsibility, without limit, for the following:
(i) Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct attributable to its personnel, and, in no event, will a Party be required to release or indemnify the other Party for Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct attributable to the other Party; and
(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","The query relates to a **""disclaimer of punitive damages,""** and the provided clauses (11.02, 11.03, and 11.04) address this issue in the following ways:

### **1. Exclusion of Punitive Damages (Clause 11.03)**  
The clause explicitly states that **neither party will be liable** for:  
- **Punitive damages** (listed alongside consequential, indirect, special, incidental, and exemplary damages).  
- Other indirect losses (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, goodwill).  

This means that even if a party suffers harm due to the other party’s actions (including negligence, breach of contract, or strict liability), **punitive damages cannot be claimed** unless an exception under **Clause 11.04** applies.  

### **2. General Liability Limitation (Clause 11.02)**  
- The disclosing party disclaims liability for losses arising from the receiving party’s use of provided materials, **even if caused by negligence** (unless gross negligence or willful misconduct is involved).  
- This reinforces that **ordinary negligence does not trigger liability**, further supporting the exclusion of punitive damages (which are often tied to reckless or intentional misconduct).  

### **3. Exceptions Where Liability (Including Punitive Damages) May Apply (Clause 11.04)**  
The disclaimer **does not apply** in cases of:  
- **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (e.g., intentional harm or extreme recklessness).  
- **Third-party claims** (where indemnity rights under law are preserved).  

Thus, **punitive damages could still be pursued** if a party’s conduct meets the threshold of **gross negligence or willful misconduct**, as these are carved out from the general liability limitations.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clauses **effectively disclaim punitive damages** for ordinary breaches, negligence, or contract disputes, but **preserve the possibility of such damages** in cases of **egregious misconduct (gross negligence/willful acts)** or third-party claims. This balances risk allocation while complying with legal standards that may prohibit blanket exclusions for intentional wrongdoing.

disclaimer of punitive damages,6a700c0c62,"EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","This clause is directly responsive to the query about a **""disclaimer of punitive damages""** because it explicitly excludes liability for **punitive damages** (along with other types of non-compensatory damages) in most circumstances. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Points:
1. **Exclusion of Punitive Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party will be liable for **""punitive or enhanced damages""** (among other categories like consequential, indirect, or exemplary damages).  
   - This aligns with the query by disclaiming liability for punitive damages, which are intended to punish wrongdoing rather than compensate for actual losses.

2. **Exceptions**:  
   - The disclaimer **does not apply** to indemnification obligations under **Section 9** for third-party claims.  
   - This means punitive damages may still be recoverable in third-party claims covered by the indemnity clause, but not in direct disputes between the parties.

3. **Broad Scope of Protection**:  
   - The exclusion applies regardless of:  
     - Foreseeability of damages (**Subsection A**).  
     - Whether the party was warned of such damages (**Subsection B**).  
     - The legal theory (contract, tort, etc.) behind the claim (**Subsection C**).  
   - This strengthens the disclaimer by making it enforceable even if punitive damages might otherwise be argued under tort law (e.g., gross negligence).

4. **Other Non-Compensatory Damages**:  
   - The clause also bars similar non-compensatory damages (e.g., exemplary, enhanced) and economic losses (lost profits, diminution in value), which are often sought alongside punitive damages in disputes.

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause explicitly answers the query by:  
- **Disclaiming punitive damages** as a recoverable category in most cases.  
- Clarifying the limited exception (indemnification for third-party claims).  
- Reinforcing the exclusion’s robustness by addressing common legal challenges (foreseeability, notice, and legal theory).  

This type of provision is common in contracts to limit exposure to unpredictable, non-economic damages and align liability with foreseeable, direct losses.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Exclusion of Punitive Damages**  
   - The clause states:  
     *""NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, **PUNITIVE** OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES...""*  
   - This clearly disclaims (excludes) liability for **punitive damages**, which are damages intended to punish a party for egregious conduct rather than compensate for actual losses.  

### 2. **Scope of the Disclaimer**  
   - The disclaimer applies broadly to both parties (mutual exclusion).  
   - It covers not only punitive damages but also:  
     - **Indirect damages** (e.g., secondary losses).  
     - **Special damages** (unique losses arising from specific circumstances).  
     - **Consequential damages** (foreseeable but indirect harms, like lost profits).  

### 3. **Additional Protections**  
   - The clause reinforces the disclaimer by stating that neither party makes any **representations or warranties** (express or implied) unless expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement.  
   - It specifically disclaims implied warranties like:  
     - **Merchantability** (fitness for ordinary use).  
     - **Fitness for a particular purpose**.  
     - Warranties arising from **course of dealing or performance**.  

### 4. **Legal Effect**  
   - By including this clause, the parties agree that neither can sue the other for punitive damages (or the other excluded categories) even if such damages might otherwise be available under applicable law.  
   - Courts generally enforce such disclaimers if they are **clear, unambiguous, and conscionable**, though local laws may limit their enforceability (e.g., in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct).  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause directly addresses the query by **contractually waiving the right to claim punitive damages** (along with other non-compensatory damages) between the parties, thereby limiting potential liability under the agreement.

(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","This clause is highly relevant to a **""disclaimer of strict liability""** because it explicitly limits or disclaims liability in several ways, including strict liability, while carving out specific exceptions. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### 1. **Disclaimer of Strict Liability (Implied)**  
   - **Paragraph 11.02** disclaims liability for losses or damages sustained by the Receiving Party, even if caused by the Disclosing Party’s **negligence** (which is broader than strict liability). While ""strict liability"" is not explicitly named here, the clause broadly shields the Disclosing Party from liability unless it involves gross negligence or willful misconduct (per **Paragraph 11.04**).  
   - **Paragraph 11.03** explicitly bars liability for certain damages (e.g., consequential, indirect, punitive) **""whether arising from contract, warranty, tort, strict liability, or otherwise.""** This directly disclaims strict liability as a basis for claims, unless an exception under **11.04** applies.

### 2. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer (Preserving Liability for Extreme Cases)**  
   - **Paragraph 11.04** carves out exceptions where liability cannot be disclaimed, such as for **gross negligence or willful misconduct**. This ensures the disclaimer does not absolve a party of liability for egregious conduct, which is a common legal safeguard.  
   - It also preserves obligations to third parties, ensuring the disclaimer does not override statutory or common-law rights (e.g., indemnity claims).

### 3. **Key Relevance to the Query**  
   - The clause **disclaims liability even under strict liability theories** (per **11.03**) unless the conduct falls under the exceptions in **11.04**.  
   - It aligns with the purpose of a strict liability disclaimer by shifting risk to the Receiving Party for ordinary use of materials, while allowing recourse only for extreme misconduct or third-party claims.  

### Practical Implications  
- A party relying on this clause could argue that claims based on strict liability (e.g., defects in materials provided under the agreement) are barred unless gross negligence or willful misconduct is proven.  
- Courts may scrutinize such disclaimers under applicable law (e.g., some jurisdictions limit disclaimers of strict liability in consumer contracts or for certain torts).  

In summary, the clause broadly disclaims strict liability (among other theories) while preserving liability for intentional or reckless wrongdoing, addressing the query comprehensively.",5

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### **1. Exclusion of Consequential and Indirect Damages**  
The clause explicitly disclaims liability for:  
- **Special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, business interruption).  
- **Broad applicability**: The disclaimer applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, statutory duty, etc.).  
- **Foreseeability does not matter**: Even if such damages were foreseeable or the party was warned of potential losses, liability is excluded.  

This aligns with a **disclaimer of strict liability** because it limits liability even in cases where a party might otherwise be held strictly liable (i.e., liable without fault) for certain types of damages.  

### **2. Exceptions to the Disclaimer**  
The clause carves out key exceptions where liability **is not** disclaimed:  
- **Indemnification obligations** (under Article 10, Sections 16.1 and 16.2) remain enforceable for third-party claims.  
- **Gross negligence or willful misconduct**: The disclaimer does not protect a party from liability arising from intentional wrongdoing or reckless disregard.  

This means the disclaimer does **not** create a blanket immunity from all liability—only from certain types of damages (consequential/indirect).  

### **3. Relevance to Strict Liability**  
- In some jurisdictions, strict liability may apply to certain contractual breaches or statutory duties.  
- This clause **narrows liability exposure** by excluding consequential damages, even in cases where strict liability might otherwise apply.  
- However, it does **not** eliminate liability entirely—core obligations (e.g., indemnification) and intentional/grossly negligent acts remain enforceable.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause functions as a **partial disclaimer of strict liability** by shielding the parties from secondary damages (consequential/indirect) while preserving liability for:  
1. **Third-party claims** (via indemnification).  
2. **Gross negligence or willful misconduct**.

disclaimer of strict liability,a96d7f948e,"14.1 NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT THE LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFIT OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILTY OF SUCH.

Here’s how it relates:

### **1. Exclusion of Strict Liability**  
Strict liability holds a party responsible for damages regardless of fault or intent. The clause explicitly disclaims this by:  
- Stating that neither party will be liable for **indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits or business opportunities), even if they were aware such damages could occur.  
- This means a party cannot be held strictly liable for these types of damages, as liability is contractually excluded unless expressly stated otherwise.  

### **2. Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
Strict liability often arises from implied warranties (e.g., merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). The clause:  
- **Disclaims all implied warranties**, including those under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) or common law.  
- Specifies that no representations or warranties exist beyond what is ""expressly set forth"" in the agreement.  
- This prevents claims based on strict liability theories that might otherwise apply to defective products or services.  

### **3. Relevance to the Query**  
A **disclaimer of strict liability** seeks to limit exposure to claims where fault is irrelevant. This clause achieves that by:  
- **Narrowing liability** to only what is expressly agreed upon.  
- **Eliminating automatic liability** for certain damages (e.g., consequential losses) and implied legal guarantees.  
- **Shifting risk** away from the parties for unforeseeable or indirect harms.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause effectively **contractually overrides strict liability** in applicable scenarios by disclaiming implied warranties and excluding broad categories of damages. Courts generally enforce such disclaimers if they are clear and conspicuous, as this one is.

Here’s how it connects to your query:

### Relevance to ""Disclaimer of Strict Liability"":
1. **Limitation of Liability Context**:  
   - While this clause does not explicitly mention ""strict liability,"" it disclaims **all implied and statutory warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a purpose).  
   - By doing so, it indirectly limits scenarios where a party could be held **strictly liable** (i.e., liable without fault) for breaches of such warranties under contract or consumer protection laws.  

2. **Exclusion of Implied Obligations**:  
   - Strict liability often arises from implied legal duties (e.g., product liability laws). This clause negates many of those implied duties by stating that no warranties exist beyond what is expressly stated in the agreement.  

3. **""To the Full Extent Allowed by Law""**:  
   - The phrase signals an attempt to disclaim liability as broadly as legally permissible, which could include strict liability claims depending on jurisdiction. However, note that some laws (e.g., consumer protection, tort) may override such disclaimers.  

### Key Difference:  
- A **disclaimer of warranties** (like this clause) focuses on denying promises about quality or performance.  
- A **disclaimer of strict liability** would explicitly address liability for harm or damages regardless of fault (e.g., ""Neither party shall be liable for incidental or consequential damages"").  

### Suggested Enhancement:  
To explicitly address strict liability, the clause could add language like:  
*""Neither party shall be liable for any damages arising from strict liability or tort claims, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.""*

### 1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**  
   - The clause disclaims liability for **special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages** (e.g., lost profits), even if the liable party was aware such damages could occur.  
   - This functions as a **partial disclaimer of strict liability**, as it shields both parties from certain financial risks beyond direct losses.  

### 2. **Preservation of Specific Obligations**  
   - The disclaimer **does not apply** to:  
     - **Indemnity obligations** (e.g., third-party claims).  
     - **Confidentiality breaches**.  
     - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** by the Supplier.  
   - This means strict liability may still apply in these excluded cases, ensuring accountability for severe misconduct or contractual breaches.  

### 3. **Alignment with Strict Liability Principles**  
   - Strict liability holds a party responsible **regardless of fault or intent**.  
   - Here, the clause **limits strict liability** for certain damages but retains it for:  
     - **Indemnity claims** (strict liability may apply per the indemnity section).  
     - **Gross negligence/willful misconduct** (where fault is clear).  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause acts as a **targeted disclaimer of strict liability** for indirect/consequential damages while preserving strict liability-like obligations in key areas (indemnity, confidentiality, and intentional misconduct). This balances risk allocation between the parties.

Here’s how it relates to your query on a **""unilateral indirect damages waiver""**:

### **1. Unilateral Nature of the Waiver**  
- The clause states that **""neither party shall be liable""** for certain damages (consequential, indirect, punitive, etc.), meaning **both parties mutually waive these claims against each other**.  
- However, the **indemnification carve-out** (the ""provided, however"" section) creates a **unilateral obligation**:  
  - If a **third party** (unaffiliated with either party) sues one party for indirect/consequential damages, the other party must still **indemnify and defend** against those claims.  
  - This means that while **both parties waive indirect damages claims against each other**, they **do not waive liability for third-party claims**—effectively making the indemnification obligation **unilateral** in certain scenarios.  

### **2. Indirect Damages Waiver**  
- The clause explicitly waives liability for **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, lost profits).  
- This is **not a full exclusion of liability** (since indemnification for third-party claims remains), but it **severely limits** the ability of either party to sue the other for these types of damages.  

### **3. Relevance to Your Query**  
- If your query is about whether this clause enforces a **unilateral waiver of indirect damages**, the answer is **partially yes**:  
  - The waiver is **mutual** between the parties (neither can claim indirect damages from the other).  
  - However, the **indemnification obligation is unilateral**—meaning one party could still be forced to cover the other’s liability for third-party indirect damages.  
- If the clause were **fully unilateral**, it would state that **only one party** (not both) waives indirect damages claims.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is **mostly mutual** in waiving indirect damages between the parties but has a **unilateral indemnity obligation** for third-party claims. If you need a **strictly unilateral waiver** (where only one party gives up indirect damages claims), the clause would need to be revised to specify that only one party is bound by the waiver.

Below is an analysis of the relevance and distinctions:

### **1. Key Aspects of the Clause**  
- **Mutual Waiver**: Both parties waive the right to claim **punitive or exemplary damages** (non-compensatory damages) from each other.  
- **Scope**: Applies to disputes ""arising under or with respect to this Agreement,"" including arbitration.  
- **Intent**: The parties acknowledge that contractual remedies and legal/equitable remedies are sufficient, eliminating claims for damages meant to punish or deter (rather than compensate).  

### **2. Relevance to ""Unilateral Indirect Damages Waiver""**  
- **Unilateral vs. Mutual**: The clause is **mutual** (both parties waive rights), whereas a ""unilateral"" waiver would apply to only one party.  
- **Indirect Damages**: The clause does **not** explicitly address **consequential, incidental, or indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm). It focuses solely on **non-compensatory damages** (punitive/exemplary).  
  - If the query seeks a waiver of indirect damages, this clause would **not** suffice, as it is narrower in scope.  
- **Legal Effect**: The clause reinforces that parties are sophisticated and knowingly waive punitive damages, which could indirectly discourage claims for other non-compensatory remedies.  

### **3. Practical Implications**  
- If the goal is to exclude **all indirect damages**, a broader clause covering **consequential, incidental, and punitive damages** would be needed.  
- This clause is more about **limiting liability to compensatory remedies** (actual damages) rather than addressing indirect economic losses.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause is **not directly responsive** to a unilateral indirect damages waiver but serves a related purpose by **mutually waiving punitive damages**. For a true ""indirect damages waiver,"" a separate clause (or modification) addressing consequential/incidental damages would be required.

EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES UNDER SECTION 7.2 [Indemnity], NEITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL EXCEED [***].","The query relates to a **""unilateral indirect damages waiver,""** which typically refers to a contractual provision where only one party waives the right to claim indirect, consequential, or special damages from the other party. However, the clause you provided (**Section 8.2 ""No Consequential Damages"" and Section 8.3 ""Limitation of Damages""**) is **mutual**, not unilateral, because it applies equally to both parties.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Mutual Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - The clause states that **neither party** will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, revenue, or data) unless an exception applies (e.g., indemnification obligations or breach of confidentiality).  
   - This is **not unilateral**—it binds both parties equally.  

2. **Exceptions Where Liability Remains**  
   - The waiver does not apply if:  
     - Damages are awarded to a third party in a judgment covered by indemnification (Section 7.2).  
     - The damages arise from a breach of nondisclosure (Section 11.4).  
     - ACSI (one party) is entitled to liquidated damages under Section 10.5.2.  

3. **Cap on Liability (Section 8.3)**  
   - Further limits liability by capping aggregate damages (except for indemnification claims).  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause is **not unilateral**—it is a **mutual waiver of indirect/consequential damages** with specific carve-outs. If the query seeks a **unilateral** waiver (where only one party gives up claims), this clause does not meet that requirement. Instead, it reflects a balanced, bilateral limitation of liability common in commercial contracts.

### Relevance of the Clause to the Query:  
The provided clause (**Section 16.5**) is a **mutual** (not unilateral) waiver of liability for **indirect, consequential, and other specified damages**. Key points:  

1. **Mutual Waiver** – The clause applies to **both parties** (""either party""), meaning neither can claim indirect/consequential damages from the other. This contrasts with a **unilateral** waiver, where only one party is restricted.  

2. **Types of Damages Waived** – The clause explicitly excludes liability for:  
   - Special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages.  
   - Claims arising from contract, tort (including negligence), or statutory breaches.  

3. **Exceptions** – The waiver does **not** apply to:  
   - Indemnification obligations under **Article 10, Sections 16.1, and 16.2** (i.e., third-party claims).  
   - Cases involving **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  

### Why This is Not a Unilateral Waiver:  
- A unilateral waiver would explicitly state that **only one party** (e.g., ""Licensee"" or ""Customer"") is barred from claiming indirect damages, while the other retains the right.  
- Here, the liability disclaimer is **symmetrical**, binding both parties equally.  

### If a Unilateral Waiver is Desired:  
To modify this into a unilateral clause, the language would need to specify that **only one party** (e.g., ""Ono"") waives claims for indirect damages against the other (""Array""), while Array retains its right to pursue such damages.  

**Example of Unilateral Language:**  
*""Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall [Party A] be liable to [Party B] for any consequential, indirect, or punitive damages; however, [Party B]’s liability for such damages to [Party A] remains unaffected.""*  

### Conclusion:  
The clause in question is a **bilateral/mutual** limitation of liability, not a unilateral one. It is relevant to the query in that it demonstrates how indirect damages are typically waived but would need restructuring to achieve a one-sided waiver.

9.1. Equitable Relief. Either party may seek equitable remedies, including injunctive relief, for a breach of the other party's obligations under Article 13 of this Agreement, prior to commencing the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 11.1 below.
9.2. Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages. Independent of, severable from, and to be enforced independently of any other provision of this Agreement, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (NOR TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS) IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KINDâ€”including lost profits, loss of business, or other economic damage, and further including injury to property, AS A RESULT OF BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED, HAD OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.
9.4. Statute of Limitations. No lawsuit or other action may be brought by either party hereto, or on any claim or controversy based upon or arising in any way out of this Agreement, after two(2) years from the date on which the party knew or reasonably should have known of an event for which a cause of action arose regardless of the nature of the claim or form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise; provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to the collection of any amounts due Metavante under this Agreement.
9.5. Tort Claim Waiver. In addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this Article 9, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives any right to recover from the other party, and Customer waives any right to recover from any Eligible Provider, any economic losses or damages in any action brought under tort theories, including, misrepresentation, negligence and/or strict liability, and/or relating to the quality or performance of any products or services provided by Metavante. For purposes of this waiver, economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service except personal injury or damage to other tangible property. Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.
9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination. Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.
9.7. Essential Elements. Customer and Metavante acknowledge and agree that the limitations contained in this Article 9 are essential to this Agreement, and that Metavante has expressly relied upon the inclusion of each and every provision of this Article 9 as a condition to executing this Agreement.","The query relates to a **""unilateral indirect damages waiver,""** which refers to a contractual provision where one party (rather than both) waives the right to claim certain types of damages, particularly indirect or consequential damages. 

### Relevance of the Clause to the Query:
1. **Mutual Exclusion of Indirect Damages (Section 9.2)**  
   - The clause is **not unilateral** but **bilateral**, as it states that **""NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY""** for incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages.  
   - This means both parties waive claims for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) arising from breaches of the agreement.  

2. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
   - This section includes a **partial unilateral element**:  
     - **Customer** explicitly waives the right to recover economic losses from **Metavante or any Eligible Provider** under tort theories (e.g., negligence, misrepresentation).  
     - However, **Metavante does not explicitly waive its own tort claims against the Customer**, suggesting an asymmetry in liability.  
   - This creates a **quasi-unilateral waiver** where the Customer bears additional restrictions not equally imposed on Metavante.  

3. **Liquidated Damages (Section 9.6)**  
   - While not directly about indirect damages, this reinforces Metavante’s protection by limiting the Customer’s liability exposure to a predefined termination fee, further restricting indirect claims.  

4. **Essential Elements (Section 9.7)**  
   - Both parties acknowledge that these limitations are **critical to the agreement**, implying that any attempt to claim indirect damages would undermine the contract’s foundation.  

### Key Takeaway:  
- The clause is **primarily bilateral** in excluding indirect damages (Section 9.2).  
- However, **Section 9.5 introduces a unilateral aspect** by requiring the Customer (but not Metavante) to waive tort-based economic claims.  
- If the query seeks a **fully unilateral waiver**, this clause does not meet that standard—but it does contain **asymmetrical liability terms favoring Metavante**.

Here’s how it aligns with your request:

### **Key Relevance to ""Mutual Indirect Damages Waiver"":**
1. **Mutual Waiver**:  
   - The clause applies to **both parties equally** (""neither party shall be liable to the other"").  
   - It waives liability for **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, special, punitive, lost profits/revenues) arising from breaches or performance under the agreement.  

2. **Scope of Waived Damages**:  
   - Explicitly covers **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, punitive) and **economic losses** (e.g., lost profits).  
   - The waiver applies **regardless of fault** (negligence, breach, or unforeseen events), reinforcing its broad protection.  

3. **Exceptions**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply to third-party claims** (e.g., indemnification obligations for claims brought by unaffiliated third parties, even if those claims include indirect damages).  

4. **Strong Language**:  
   - The clause is **non-negotiable** (""notwithstanding anything to the contrary"") and survives **pre-existing conditions or unanticipated events**.  

### **Why This Matters for Your Query:**  
- If you sought a clause where both parties agree **not to hold each other liable for indirect or consequential damages**, this provision achieves that.  
- It balances risk allocation by **protecting both sides from speculative or disproportionate losses** while preserving indemnity rights for third-party claims.

Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The query relates to a **""mutual indirect damages waiver,""** which typically refers to an agreement between parties to waive claims for certain types of damages that are not directly tied to actual losses (e.g., consequential, incidental, punitive, or exemplary damages).  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
The provided **Section 14 (""Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages"")** is directly relevant because it:  

1. **Waives Punitive/Exemplary Damages**  
   - The clause explicitly states that both parties waive any right to claim **punitive or exemplary damages**, which are non-compensatory (i.e., not tied to actual harm but intended to punish or deter misconduct).  
   - This aligns with the concept of a **mutual waiver of indirect damages**, as punitive/exemplary damages are a subset of indirect damages.  

2. **Mutual and Irrevocable Waiver**  
   - The waiver is **unconditional, irrevocable, and mutual**, meaning both parties agree not to seek these damages from each other.  
   - This reinforces the **""mutual""** aspect of the query.  

3. **Limitation to Contractual Remedies**  
   - The clause confirms that the remedies provided in the agreement (e.g., compensatory damages) and other legal/equitable remedies are deemed sufficient.  
   - This further supports the exclusion of **indirect or non-compensatory damages**.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
While the clause does not explicitly mention **""indirect damages""** (which could include consequential or incidental damages), it **does cover a critical subset of indirect damages—punitive/exemplary damages—in a mutual waiver.** If the query seeks a broader waiver (e.g., including consequential damages), the clause would need expansion.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects of the Mutual Indirect Damages Waiver:
1. **Mutual Waiver**:  
   - Both parties agree (under Section 8.2) that neither will be liable to the other for **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, or data) or **consequential damages**, even if advised of the possibility. This is a bilateral (mutual) exclusion.

2. **Exceptions**:  
   - The waiver does not apply to:  
     - Indemnifiable claims under **Section 7.2** (e.g., third-party claims).  
     - Breaches of **Section 11.4 (Nondisclosure)**.  
     - Liquidated damages under **Section 10.5.2** (specific carve-out for ACSI).  

3. **Additional Cap on Liability**:  
   - **Section 8.3** reinforces the limitation by capping each party’s **total aggregate liability** (except for indemnity obligations) to a specified amount ([***]).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause explicitly implements a **mutual waiver of indirect/consequential damages** (Section 8.2) while preserving certain exceptions.  
- It balances risk allocation by:  
  - Protecting both parties from unpredictable, disproportionate losses (e.g., business interruption).  
  - Allowing recovery for direct damages (e.g., breach of confidentiality) or agreed remedies (e.g., liquidated damages).  

### Practical Effect:  
- Parties cannot sue each other for **consequential losses** (like lost profits) unless the claim falls under the exceptions (indemnity, confidentiality, or agreed liquidated damages).  
- The **monetary cap** (Section 8.3) further limits exposure, ensuring predictability in potential liabilities.

### **1. Mutual Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 12.3)**  
- **Relevance to Query**: The clause explicitly waives liability for **indirect, consequential, special damages, and lost profits** for **both parties** (mutual application).  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Neither party can claim damages like lost revenue, business interruption, or other unforeseeable losses.  
  - **Exception**: The waiver does **not** apply to indemnifiable losses (e.g., third-party claims covered under indemnification clauses).  

### **2. Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
- **Relevance to Query**: While not a direct waiver, this section reinforces the mutual limitation of liability by capping each party’s total exposure (e.g., to a predefined dollar amount).  
- **Key Points**:  
  - The cap applies to **all claims** (contract, tort, negligence, etc.), including indemnification claims under Section 12.  
  - Ensures predictability by preventing unlimited liability, even for direct damages.  

### **How This Addresses the Query**  
- The clause is a **mutual waiver** (applies to both parties) and explicitly excludes indirect/consequential damages (per the query).  
- It balances risk allocation by:  
  - Barring speculative damages (e.g., lost profits) while preserving indemnification for third-party claims.  
  - Imposing a financial cap to further limit exposure.  

### **Practical Implications**  
- Protects both parties from unpredictable, disproportionate losses.  
- Common in contracts where consequential damages could far exceed the contract value (e.g., IT services, construction).

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Mutual Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - This section explicitly states that **neither party will be liable** for:  
     - **Indirect damages** (e.g., lost opportunities, reputational harm).  
     - **Consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption).  
     - **Special damages** (unusual losses not typically foreseeable).  
   - The waiver is **mutual**, meaning it applies equally to both parties.  
   - **Exception**: The waiver does **not** apply to indemnifiable losses (e.g., third-party claims covered under indemnification clauses).  

### 2. **Overall Liability Cap (Section 12.4)**  
   - Even beyond indirect/consequential damages, this section imposes a **monetary cap** on **all** liability (regardless of legal theory—contract, tort, negligence, etc.).  
   - The cap applies **even if** a party is aware of potential damages.  
   - This reinforces the mutual limitation of risk between the parties.  

### **Why This Answers the Query**  
- The clause **explicitly waives mutual liability for indirect/consequential damages** (Section 12.3).  
- It also **supports the waiver with a broader liability limitation** (Section 12.4), ensuring neither party faces unlimited exposure.  
- The **exception for indemnifiable losses** ensures third-party claims (e.g., IP infringement, breach of reps & warranties) are still covered.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This is a **standard but strong mutual waiver of indirect damages** with a liability cap, which is a common risk-allocation mechanism in contracts. It protects both parties from unpredictable, disproportionate losses while preserving core indemnification rights.

Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that neither party is liable for **""indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages""** (among others) arising from the agreement or its breach.  
   - This includes a waiver of **indirect damages**, which aligns with the query’s focus.

2. **Subject to Law**:  
   - While the clause attempts to waive liability for indirect damages, its enforceability depends on **governing law**. Some jurisdictions may limit or invalidate such waivers, especially if they are deemed unconscionable, against public policy, or inapplicable to certain types of claims (e.g., gross negligence, willful misconduct, or statutory rights).  
   - The clause acknowledges this indirectly by stating it applies **""notwithstanding... negligence, fault, or responsibility""**, but courts may still override it if local law prohibits such waivers.

3. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   - The waiver does **not** apply to third-party claims (e.g., indemnification obligations). This means a party could still be liable for indirect damages **claimed by unaffiliated third parties**, even if the parties waive them between themselves.  
   - This carve-out shows the clause is **not absolute** and is tailored to comply with legal realities (e.g., indemnity laws).

4. **Broad Language but Legal Limits**:  
   - The clause uses sweeping language (e.g., ""notwithstanding anything to the contrary""), but its validity is still **subject to applicable law**. For example:  
     - In some U.S. states, waivers of indirect damages in commercial contracts are enforceable.  
     - In the EU or under certain consumer protection laws, such waivers may be restricted.  
     - Claims involving fraud, intentional harm, or statutory violations typically cannot be waived.

### Conclusion:  
The clause **attempts** to waive liability for indirect damages, but its effectiveness depends on the **governing law and jurisdiction**. The query’s concern about legal limitations is valid—while the parties agree to waive indirect damages, a court may disregard the waiver if it conflicts with mandatory law or public policy.

The provided clause is highly relevant because it:  

1. **Explicitly Waives Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause states that the **Provider shall not be liable for any incidental or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits or revenues), even if the Company warned about such potential losses. This is a clear waiver of indirect damages.  

2. **Acknowledges Legal Limits**:  
   - The clause carves out exceptions where liability **cannot** be waived under applicable law, such as:  
     - Bodily injury/death caused by negligence (typically non-waivable under tort law).  
     - Property damage caused by negligence (often subject to statutory limits).  
     - Willful/intentional misconduct (many jurisdictions prohibit waivers for gross negligence or intentional harm).  
   - This implies the parties recognize that certain liabilities are **mandated by law** and cannot be contractually excluded.  

3. **Complies with Enforceability Standards**:  
   - Courts often scrutinize liability waivers for fairness and legality. By limiting the waiver to **permissible categories** (e.g., commercial losses) and excluding legally protected claims (e.g., personal injury), the clause aligns with typical enforceability standards.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **is subject to law** because:  
- It excludes indirect damages only to the extent permitted by law.  
- It preserves liability where legal rules override contractual waivers (e.g., for negligence, willful acts, or statutory protections).  
- Its enforceability would depend on jurisdiction-specific rules governing exculpatory clauses.

such liability may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.
27.2 Indirect Damages. In no event will either PARTY be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages in any way related to a relevant
PURCHASE ORDER, even if the damages are foreseeable or the possibility of the damages has been communicated.
27.3 Acknowledged Direct Damages. Any damages resulting from breach of confidentiality, privacy or data security obligations pursuant to an applicable
PURCHASE ORDER or these Ts&Cs are acknowledged to be direct damages and neither party will assert these damages are special, indirect or
consequential.
27.4 VF’S Limitation of Liability. Except for VF’s indemnification obligations or breach of confidentiality obligations, in no event will THE COMPANY, or

Here’s how the clause is relevant:

### **1. Indirect Damages Waiver (Clause 27.2)**
- The clause explicitly states that **neither party will be liable for indirect, special, or consequential damages**, even if foreseeable or communicated.  
- However, this waiver is **subject to legal limitations**—meaning that if applicable law prohibits the exclusion of certain liabilities (e.g., gross negligence, wilful misconduct, fraud, or personal injury/death), the waiver **will not override those legal requirements**.

### **2. Legal Exceptions (Clause 27.1)**
- The clause clarifies that **the waiver of liability does not apply** where the law prohibits such exclusions, including cases involving:
  - **Gross negligence or wilful misconduct**  
  - **Fraudulent acts**  
  - **Death or personal injury caused by negligence or misconduct**  
  - **Any other liability that cannot be excluded by law**  

### **3. Acknowledged Direct Damages (Clause 27.3)**
- Some damages (e.g., breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or data security) are **expressly classified as direct damages**, meaning they **cannot be waived as indirect/consequential damages**.  
- This reinforces that the **indirect damage waiver is not absolute** and must comply with legal and contractual carve-outs.

### **Conclusion**
The **indirect damage waiver (27.2) is indeed subject to law**, as the clause explicitly recognizes that **mandatory legal protections (27.1) override contractual limitations**. Additionally, certain damages (27.3) are treated as direct, further restricting the scope of the waiver. Thus, while the parties agree to exclude indirect liability, **this exclusion is not enforceable where prohibited by law**.

Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause explicitly states that neither party is liable for **indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages** (unless expressly provided otherwise in the agreement). This constitutes a contractual waiver of such damages.  

2. **Subject to Law**:  
   The clause acknowledges legal limits by:  
   - **Exceptions for Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct**: The waiver does not apply if damages result from gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing, which many jurisdictions do not allow parties to contractually exclude.  
   - **Indemnification Carve-Out**: The limitation does not restrict indemnification obligations to third parties under **Article 10, Sections 16.1, and 16.2**, which may be required by law (e.g., statutory liabilities).  

3. **Legal Enforceability**:  
   - The clause’s validity depends on governing law. Some jurisdictions may invalidate broad exclusions of liability (e.g., for negligence in consumer contracts or under mandatory laws).  
   - The phrase **""unless expressly provided hereunder""** implies compliance with contractual or legal requirements that might override the waiver.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **waives indirect damages** but is **subject to legal boundaries** (e.g., gross negligence, statutory duties, or mandatory indemnification rules). Courts may scrutinize such waivers under applicable law to ensure they do not violate public policy or statutory protections.  

Thus, the clause directly responds to the query by showing that while parties may agree to waive indirect damages, the waiver’s enforceability is **conditional on legal principles**.",5
indirect damage waiver is subject to law,95e0cedd33,"8.3 Limitation of Damages. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES UNDER SECTION 7.2 [Indemnity], NEITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL EXCEED [***].","The query asks whether an **indirect damage waiver is subject to law**, and the provided **clause (8.3 Limitation of Damages)** is relevant in the following ways:

### 1. **Indirect Damages and Waiver**  
The clause limits **aggregate liability** for damages arising from the agreement, which typically includes **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, or punitive damages) unless explicitly carved out. However, this clause does **not explicitly waive indirect damages**—it only **caps total liability** (subject to exceptions like indemnity under **Section 7.2**).  

   - If the parties intended to **waive indirect damages entirely**, a more explicit exclusion (e.g., ""Neither party shall be liable for any indirect, consequential, or punitive damages"") would be needed.  
   - Since the clause is silent on **indirect damages specifically**, their waiver or limitation would depend on:  
     - **Governing law**: Some jurisdictions restrict the enforceability of indirect damage waivers (e.g., consumer protection laws, negligence cases).  
     - **Judicial interpretation**: Courts may assess whether the limitation clause covers indirect damages by implication.  

### 2. **Subject to Law**  
The clause’s enforceability depends on applicable law:  
   - **Contract law principles**: Many jurisdictions uphold limitation clauses unless they are unconscionable or violate public policy.  
   - **Statutory exceptions**: Some laws (e.g., UCC in the U.S., unfair contract terms regulations in the EU) may invalidate clauses that attempt to limit liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or statutory violations.  
   - **Indemnity carve-out**: The exception for **Section 7.2 (Indemnity)** suggests that liability for third-party claims (e.g., IP infringement) remains uncapped, which may override any indirect damage waiver for those scenarios.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **limits total liability** but does not expressly waive indirect damages. Whether such a waiver exists (and is enforceable) depends on:  
1. **Interpretation of the clause** (if ""liability"" is construed to include indirect damages).  
2. **Governing law** (local statutes or case law may override limitations).  
3. **Specific exceptions** (like indemnity obligations, which may preserve liability for certain indirect losses).  

For a clear waiver of indirect damages, the clause should explicitly state it. Otherwise, courts or laws may determine its scope.

indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,32762b4bf5,"ARTICLE 9 - INDEMNIFICATION
Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;
(4) If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, with a reservation of all rights to seek indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party; provided, that Indemnitee may enter into a settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the indemnifying party, if the terms of such settlement (i) include only money damages as a remedy, (ii) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on the indemnifying party's business and (iii) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by the indemnifying party; and
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The query asks about an **""indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver""**, which refers to whether the indemnification clause excludes (or ""carves out"") liability for **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, or special damages) from the scope of indemnifiable losses.  

### **Relevance to the Clause:**
1. **Indemnification Scope (Section 9.1(a))**  
   - The clause broadly covers **""any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability""** arising from third-party claims.  
   - It does **not explicitly exclude indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) from indemnifiable losses.  
   - However, the phrase **""to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's breach or misconduct""** suggests that **indirect consequences** of a breach (e.g., downstream losses) **could** be covered, unless limited elsewhere in the agreement.  

2. **Potential Carveout for Indirect Damages**  
   - If the parties intended to **exclude indirect damages** from indemnification, this clause does **not** do so explicitly.  
   - Typically, a separate **""Limitation of Liability""** clause elsewhere in the agreement would exclude indirect damages (e.g., ""Neither party shall be liable for consequential, incidental, or indirect damages"").  
   - If no such exclusion exists, **indirect damages could still be indemnifiable** under this clause.  

3. **Claims Procedure (Section 9.1(b))**  
   - The claims process does not distinguish between **direct vs. indirect damages**, meaning both could be subject to indemnification if they fall under the definition of **""Loss""**.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
This indemnification clause **does not contain an express carveout for indirect damages**, meaning they **could** be covered if they result from a breach or misconduct. However, if the parties want to exclude them, they should:  
   - Add an **explicit exclusion** in this clause (e.g., ""excluding consequential, incidental, or indirect damages""), **or**  
   - Ensure a **separate ""Limitation of Liability""** provision in the agreement excludes such damages.

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - The clause states that neither party is liable for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (including lost profits).  
   - However, it **carves out an exception** for indemnification obligations, meaning that indemnifiable losses (e.g., third-party claims) **can still include indirect/consequential damages** if they qualify as ""Indemnifiable Loss.""  

2. **Liability Cap (Section 12.4)**  
   - While the agreement imposes an overall **monetary cap on liability**, it explicitly states that this applies **regardless of the form of action**, including indemnification claims.  
   - This means that even though indemnification can cover indirect damages (per Section 12.3), the **total liability (including indemnification) is still capped** at the agreed amount.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query:**  
- The clause **does carve out indemnification from the indirect/consequential damages waiver** (i.e., indemnifiable losses can include such damages).  
- However, the **overall liability cap still applies**, meaning indemnification claims (even for indirect damages) are subject to the monetary limit in Section 12.4.  

This structure balances **risk allocation** by:  
- Protecting parties from open-ended exposure to indirect damages **except in indemnification scenarios** (e.g., third-party claims).  
- Ensuring that even indemnification liability is **not unlimited** due to the cap.

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - The clause states that neither party is liable for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (including lost profits).  
   - However, it **explicitly carves out indemnification obligations** from this waiver by stating:  
     > *""This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.""*  
   - This means that while general claims for indirect damages are barred, **indemnifiable losses (e.g., third-party claims, IP infringement, or breaches of representations) can still include indirect/consequential damages** if they fall under the indemnity section.  

2. **Overall Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - The clause imposes a **monetary cap** on liability for all claims, **including indemnification claims**.  
   - However, the carveout in **Section 12.3 ensures that indemnifiable losses are not excluded just because they involve indirect damages**—they are still recoverable (subject to the cap).  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
- The clause **carves out indemnification from the indirect damages waiver**, meaning indemnifiable losses can include consequential damages.  
- However, the **total liability (including indemnification) is still capped** per Section 12.4.

indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The query asks about an **""indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,""** which refers to whether the indemnification clause excludes (i.e., ""carves out"") liability for **indirect damages** (such as consequential, incidental, or special damages) even though the clause otherwise requires one party to indemnify the other for certain claims.  

### **Relevance to the Clause:**
1. **Indemnification Scope**  
   - The clause requires each party to indemnify the other for **third-party claims** arising from bodily injury, property damage, or related losses caused by negligence or intentional acts.  
   - However, it **does not explicitly mention indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, reputational harm).  

2. **Indirect Damage Waiver (Carveout)**  
   - The clause focuses on **direct damages** (bodily injury, tangible property damage) and excludes **lost or damaged data**, which is often considered an indirect damage.  
   - Since consequential/indirect damages are not expressly included, they are likely **waived or excluded** unless another part of the contract addresses them.  

3. **Proportional Liability for Contributory Fault**  
   - If the indemnified party’s own negligence contributed to the loss, the indemnifying party’s liability is **proportionately reduced**.  
   - This suggests that **indirect consequences** (e.g., downstream financial losses) are not fully covered unless directly tied to the indemnifiable claims.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **does not explicitly carve out indirect damages**, but its focus on **third-party claims for bodily injury and tangible property damage** (excluding data loss) implies that broader indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) are **not indemnifiable** under this provision. If the contract has a separate **limitation of liability clause**, it may further clarify whether indirect damages are waived.

### **1. Indemnification Scope**  
The clause broadly requires the indemnifying party (the franchisee) to cover **all losses and expenses** (including indirect damages like reputational harm, punitive damages, and legal fees) arising from their operation of the franchise, **even if the liability is indirect or vicarious**.  

### **2. Indirect Damage Waiver (Carveout)**  
While the indemnification is expansive, there is a **carveout** (exception) for liabilities arising from the **gross negligence of the Indemnitees** (the franchisor and its affiliates). This means:  
- The franchisee **does not** have to indemnify the franchisor for losses caused by the franchisor’s own gross negligence.  
- However, if liability is **joint or comparative** (e.g., both parties share fault), the indemnification still applies to the franchisee’s portion of negligence.  

### **3. Relevance to Query**  
The clause **waives indemnification for indirect damages** (e.g., reputational harm, punitive damages) **only if they stem from the Indemnitees’ gross negligence**. Otherwise, the franchisee remains on the hook for **all other indirect damages** tied to their actions.  

### **Key Takeaways:**  
- **Broad indemnification** covers direct and indirect damages (e.g., fines, reputational harm).  
- **Carveout for gross negligence** limits indemnification when the franchisor is primarily at fault.  
- **No blanket waiver for indirect damages**—only excluded if caused by the Indemnitees’ gross negligence.

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause states that, generally, neither party can be held liable for **special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages** (common types of ""indirect"" or non-direct damages in contracts). This is a broad limitation of liability.

2. **Exception for IP Infringement Claims**:  
   However, the clause **explicitly excludes** claims or liabilities arising from **third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement** from this waiver. This means:  
   - If one party infringes a third party’s IP (e.g., patents, copyrights, trademarks), the other party **can** still sue for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or downstream losses) resulting from that infringement.  
   - The waiver does **not** protect the infringing party from being liable for these broader damages in IP-related cases.

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause acknowledges that IP infringement risks are often significant and may warrant broader liability exposure. By excluding IP claims from the indirect damages waiver, the parties ensure that:  
- The injured party retains full recourse for IP-related harms (which can be costly and far-reaching).  
- The infringing party cannot shield itself from the full consequences of IP violations under the general damages waiver.  

This is a common negotiation point in contracts involving technology, licensing, or creative works, where IP risks are high.",5

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Relevance:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) arising from the agreement, even if caused by negligence.  

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   The waiver **does not apply** in specific scenarios, including:  
   - **Breach of IP-Related Obligations**:  
     - If a party breaches **Article 7** (which likely covers **confidentiality or IP protections**), the waiver of indirect damages is **excluded**. This means the non-breaching party could still claim indirect damages for IP infringement.  
   - **Breach of Warranties (Section 8.1.5(v))**:  
     - If the breached warranty relates to **IP representations** (e.g., a party falsely warranted non-infringement), indirect damages may be recoverable.  
   - **Indemnification for IP Infringement (Sections 9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d))**:  
     - The clause explicitly carves out indemnification obligations for IP infringement claims (e.g., third-party suits). Indirect damages linked to such claims are **not waived**.  

### Why This Matters for IP Infringement:  
- The clause ensures that while parties generally avoid liability for indirect damages, **IP-related breaches or claims remain actionable**, including recovery of consequential losses (e.g., lost sales due to infringement).  
- This exception aligns with common contractual risk allocation, where IP infringement is treated as a **high-stakes risk** outside standard liability caps.  

### Summary:  
The clause **preserves the right to pursue indirect damages** for IP breaches, indemnified claims, or warranty violations, while shielding parties from such liability in other contexts. This balances risk while protecting against severe IP-related harms.

THIS ARTICLE X SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS WAIVED BY THIS PROVISION, OR ANY OTHER EVENT OR CONDITION, WHETHER ANTICIPATED OR UNANTICIPATED, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER PRE-EXISTING PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT.","The query asks about an **""IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver""** in the context of the provided clause. Here's how the clause addresses this:

### **1. General Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect, consequential, special, punitive, and similar damages** (including lost profits) arising from breaches of the agreement. This means neither party can typically sue the other for these types of damages, even if they result from negligence or other unforeseen events.

### **2. Exception for Third-Party Claims (Including IP Infringement)**  
The key exception is in the **""provided, however""** proviso, which states that the waiver **does not limit indemnification obligations** for claims brought by **unaffiliated third parties**. This includes:  
- **Third-party claims for IP infringement** (e.g., copyright, patent, or trademark violations).  
- Third-party claims for **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., if a third party sues for lost profits due to IP infringement).  

Thus, while the parties waive claims against *each other* for indirect damages, they **must still indemnify (defend and cover costs)** for third-party claims, including IP-related claims that could involve indirect damages (e.g., a third party’s lost profits due to infringement).

### **3. Relevance to the Query**  
The clause **does not carve out IP infringement claims between the parties themselves** (e.g., if Party A sues Party B for IP breach under the agreement). However, it **preserves indemnity obligations for third-party IP claims**, ensuring that indirect damages sought by outsiders (e.g., customers or competitors) are not waived.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause **waives indirect damages between the contracting parties** but **protects the indemnified party from third-party claims**, including IP infringement cases where indirect damages (like lost profits) are often sought. If the query seeks to modify this, a specific carve-out for IP breaches between the parties (not just third parties) may be needed.

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, goodwill) **unless** the liability arises from **Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)**.  
   - This means that **IP infringement claims are carved out from the waiver**, allowing a party to seek such damages if the other party violates IP rights.

2. **Cap on Liability with IP Infringement Exception**  
   - The clause also limits total liability to the amount earned under **Section 5.4 (Revenue Sharing)** in the **12 months preceding the claim**.  
   - However, this cap **does not apply to IP infringement claims** under **Section 9.3**, meaning liability for IP infringement could exceed the revenue-sharing cap.  

### **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
The clause explicitly **preserves the right to claim indirect/consequential damages** (and lifts the liability cap) **only for IP infringement claims**. For all other breaches, indirect damages are waived, and liability is capped.  

Thus, the **exception for IP infringement** ensures that a party harmed by IP violations can pursue **full remedies**, including types of damages otherwise excluded (e.g., lost profits). This reflects the heightened risks and legal sensitivities around IP disputes.

9.2. Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages. Independent of, severable from, and to be enforced independently of any other provision of this Agreement, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (NOR TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS) IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KINDâ€”including lost profits, loss of business, or other economic damage, and further including injury to property, AS A RESULT OF BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED, HAD OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.
9.4. Statute of Limitations. No lawsuit or other action may be brought by either party hereto, or on any claim or controversy based upon or arising in any way out of this Agreement, after two(2) years from the date on which the party knew or reasonably should have known of an event for which a cause of action arose regardless of the nature of the claim or form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise; provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to the collection of any amounts due Metavante under this Agreement.
9.5. Tort Claim Waiver. In addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this Article 9, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives any right to recover from the other party, and Customer waives any right to recover from any Eligible Provider, any economic losses or damages in any action brought under tort theories, including, misrepresentation, negligence and/or strict liability, and/or relating to the quality or performance of any products or services provided by Metavante. For purposes of this waiver, economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service except personal injury or damage to other tangible property. Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.
9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination. Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.
9.7. Essential Elements. Customer and Metavante acknowledge and agree that the limitations contained in this Article 9 are essential to this Agreement, and that Metavante has expressly relied upon the inclusion of each and every provision of this Article 9 as a condition to executing this Agreement.","The query asks about an **IP infringement exception to an indirect damage waiver** in the context of the provided limitation of liability clause. Here's how the clause is relevant:

### **1. General Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**  
The clause broadly excludes liability for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including lost profits, business losses, or economic harm—**even if the party was aware such damages could occur**. This applies to **all claims**, including breach of warranty or failure of performance.  

However, **IP infringement is not explicitly mentioned** in this waiver. If IP infringement claims (e.g., copyright, patent, or trademark violations) are covered under this Agreement, they **could** fall under the general exclusion of consequential damages—**unless an exception applies**.

### **2. Equitable Relief for IP Infringement (Section 9.1)**  
Section 9.1 allows either party to seek **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions)** for breaches of **Article 13** (which presumably covers IP obligations, though not provided here). This implies:  
- **IP breaches may not be fully subject to the damage waiver**—since injunctive relief is preserved.  
- If Article 13 imposes IP-related obligations (e.g., indemnification or warranties), a party **might still claim direct damages** (not barred by 9.2) or **seek injunctions** to stop infringement.  

### **3. Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5) & Economic Loss Rule**  
Section 9.5 waives **tort-based claims** (e.g., negligence, misrepresentation) for **economic losses**, but:  
- **IP infringement is often a tort (e.g., ""misrepresentation"" in trademark cases)**.  
- If IP claims are framed in tort, this waiver **could limit recovery** to contractual remedies only.  
- However, **willful IP infringement** (e.g., intentional misuse) might still allow claims outside this waiver.  

### **4. Key Takeaways on IP Infringement Exception**  
- **No explicit carve-out for IP damages** in the waiver (Section 9.2), so **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits from infringement) **may be excluded**.  
- **Equitable relief (injunctions) remains available** for IP breaches (Section 9.1).  
- **Tort-based IP claims** (e.g., negligence in IP handling) **may be waived** for economic losses (Section 9.5).  
- **Direct damages** (e.g., costs of IP litigation or statutory damages) **might still apply** if not classified as ""consequential.""  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **does not explicitly exempt IP infringement from the indirect damage waiver**, but:  
- Injunctive relief is preserved.  
- Tort claims for economic harm (common in IP cases) are waived.  
- If Article 13 contains IP-specific liability terms, those may override the general waiver.  

For a definitive answer, **Article 13’s IP provisions** (if any) must be reviewed to see if they create an exception to Section 9.2’s waiver.",5
third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","This clause is directly relevant to the query about a **third-party IP infringement exception to an indirect damage waiver** because it carves out a specific scenario where the general waiver of liability for indirect damages does not apply. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause states that, in general, neither party can be held liable for **special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or downstream losses). This is a common limitation of liability in contracts.

2. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement**:  
   However, the clause explicitly **excludes claims or liabilities arising from third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement** from this waiver. This means:  
   - If one party’s actions (e.g., using unlicensed software or infringing a patent) lead to a third-party IP claim, the other party **can still sue for indirect damages** (e.g., lost revenue due to a lawsuit or injunction).  
   - The exception ensures that the party harmed by IP-related risks retains full recourse, including claims for consequential losses, which might otherwise be barred under the general waiver.

### Why This Matters to the Query:  
The clause addresses the **asymmetrical risk of IP infringement**. While parties often agree to limit liability for indirect harms, IP infringement claims can have severe downstream consequences (e.g., product recalls or legal injunctions). By excluding IP infringement from the waiver, the clause ensures the harmed party isn’t left unprotected when such high-stakes claims arise.  

In short: **Indirect damages are usually waived, but not if they stem from third-party IP infringement.** This exception reflects the heightened accountability typically applied to IP matters in contracts.",5

Here’s the relevance of the clause to the query:

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause (Section 9.3) broadly states that neither party is liable for **indirect, consequential, or incidental damages** arising from the Agreement, even if foreseeable. This is a standard risk allocation provision.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   The waiver of indirect damages **does not apply** in specific scenarios, including:  
   - Breaches of **Article 7** (likely covering confidentiality or IP protections).  
   - Breaches of **Section 8.1.5(v)** (a representation/warranty, possibly related to IP non-infringement).  
   - **Indemnification obligations** under Sections **9.4(i)(d)** (Impresse’s duty to indemnify for third-party IP claims) and **9.5(i)(d)** (VerticalNet’s equivalent duty).  

3. **Link to Third-Party IP Infringement**:  
   - If a third party sues for IP infringement (e.g., patent/copyright violation), the indemnifying party (Impresse or VerticalNet) must cover the damages under **Sections 9.4(i)(d) or 9.5(i)(d)**.  
   - Because these indemnities are **excepted from the indirect damages waiver**, the indemnifying party could still be liable for **consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) stemming from the infringement, even though such damages are otherwise excluded under Section 9.3.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause ensures that while most indirect damages are waived, **third-party IP infringement claims** (covered by indemnification) remain an exception. This means the indemnifying party may face broader liability, including consequential damages, for IP-related breaches or claims.

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, punitive, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits, goodwill) under most circumstances.  
   - This is a standard risk allocation provision to limit exposure to unpredictable or disproportionate losses.

2. **Exception for IP Infringement (Section 9.3)**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** to liability arising from **IP infringement claims** (referenced as ""Section 9.3"").  
   - This means:  
     - If a third party sues for IP infringement (e.g., copyright, patent, or trademark violations), the liable party **could still be responsible for indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits due to an injunction).  
     - The **monetary cap** (limited to 12 months of revenue share under Section 5.4) also **does not apply** to IP infringement claims.  

3. **Why This Matters for the Query**:  
   - The clause explicitly **carves out IP infringement** from the limitations on liability, meaning:  
     - **Indirect damages** (normally waived) **may still be recoverable** in IP disputes.  
     - The **financial cap** on liability is **lifted** for IP claims, exposing parties to potentially higher risks.  

### Practical Implications:
- A party accused of third-party IP infringement (e.g., using unlicensed software in deliverables) could face **uncapped liability**, including consequential damages.  
- This exception incentivizes parties to:  
  - Secure proper IP rights (e.g., licenses, warranties).  
  - Address IP risks in indemnification clauses (likely in Section 9.3).  

In summary, the clause **preserves full liability exposure for IP infringement** while shielding parties from indirect damages in other scenarios. The query highlights this critical exception.",5

### **1. General Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect, consequential, special, punitive, and other similar damages** (e.g., lost profits) between the contracting parties. This means that if one party breaches the agreement, the other cannot claim these types of damages **from each other**.

### **2. Exception for Third-Party Claims (Including IP Infringement)**  
The **""provided, however""** exception explicitly states that the waiver **does not limit** a party’s obligation to:  
- **Indemnify** (compensate for loss)  
- **Defend** (cover legal costs)  
- **Hold harmless** (protect from liability)  
the other party against **third-party claims**, including claims for **indirect, consequential, or punitive damages**.  

This means:  
- If a **third party** (e.g., a patent holder) sues one party for **IP infringement**, and that claim includes demands for **indirect or consequential damages**, the indemnifying party **cannot use this waiver clause to avoid liability**.  
- The indemnity obligation **overrides** the general waiver of indirect damages when it comes to third-party claims.  

### **3. Relevance to IP Infringement Specifically**  
- Many third-party IP claims (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark infringement) often seek **consequential or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits due to infringement).  
- This clause ensures that if such a claim arises, the party responsible for indemnification **must cover these damages**, even though they are otherwise waived in disputes **between the contracting parties**.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **preserves liability for third-party IP infringement claims** (including indirect damages) while **waiving such damages in disputes solely between the two contracting parties**. This balances risk allocation—protecting each other from internal claims but ensuring accountability for external legal exposures.

third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The query asks about how **third-party IP infringement** is treated as an exception to the **waiver of indirect damages** in the liability limitation clause. Here’s how the clause (Section 13.4) addresses this:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, and similar damages** (e.g., lost profits) for either party, even if foreseeable. This is a standard limitation of liability in contracts.

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**:  
   The carve-out at the end of the clause states that the waiver **does not apply** if:  
   - A third party (e.g., a patent holder suing for IP infringement) is awarded such damages (e.g., statutory damages for IP infringement) under a **Third-Party Claim**; or  
   - The limitation is **contrary to Applicable Law** (e.g., if local law prohibits excluding liability for IP infringement).  

3. **Connection to IP Infringement**:  
   If a third party sues one party (e.g., the vendor) for **IP infringement** (a type of Third-Party Claim) and wins **consequential/statutory damages**, the other party (e.g., the customer) could still recover those damages from the infringing party under this clause. Without this exception, the waiver might otherwise shield the infringing party from liability for such third-party awards.

4. **Indemnification Link**:  
   The clause explicitly preserves indemnification obligations (which often cover third-party IP claims). This means that while indirect damages between the parties are waived, **indemnity for third-party IP claims** (including their associated damages) remains enforceable.

### Practical Implications:
- A party sued for IP infringement by a third party **cannot use this clause** to avoid paying damages awarded to that third party (e.g., lost profits or statutory penalties).  
- However, **direct claims between the contracting parties** for IP-related losses (e.g., a customer’s own lost profits due to the vendor’s infringement) would still fall under the waiver unless covered by indemnification or another clause.

In summary, the clause ensures that third-party IP infringement liabilities (and related damages) are **not shielded** by the general waiver of indirect damages, aligning with typical risk allocation in contracts where IP infringement risks are often carved out from liability caps.",5
"indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third party IP infringement and fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct",a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided is a **limitation of liability** provision that specifically addresses **indirect damages** while carving out exceptions for certain types of claims, including **third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement**. Here’s how it aligns with your query regarding **indirect damage waivers that exclude third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**:

### **1. Indirect Damage Waiver**  
The clause states:  
> *""in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind""*  

This is a **broad waiver of indirect damages**, meaning neither party can claim compensation for losses like lost profits, business interruption, or reputational harm that arise indirectly from the contract.

### **2. Exclusion for Third-Party IP Infringement**  
The clause carves out an exception:  
> *""Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right...""*  

This means that **if a third party sues for IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations), the waiver of indirect damages does not apply**. The liable party could still be on the hook for indirect damages related to such claims.

### **3. Missing Exclusions (Fraud, Gross Negligence, Willful Misconduct)**  
While the clause excludes **third-party IP infringement** from the waiver, it **does not explicitly exclude**:  
- **Fraud**  
- **Gross negligence**  
- **Willful misconduct**  

This could be a **gap** if the intent is to ensure liability remains for intentional or reckless wrongdoing. Many contracts explicitly state that limitations of liability **do not apply** to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.  

### **Relevance to Your Query**  
- The clause **partially matches** your requirement by excluding third-party IP infringement from the waiver of indirect damages.  
- However, it **does not address fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**, meaning a party could still avoid liability for indirect damages even in cases of serious misconduct unless another clause covers it.  

### **Suggested Improvement**  
To fully align with your query, the clause could be revised to include:  
> *""Except with respect to (i) any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third-party intellectual property right, (ii) fraud, (iii) gross negligence, or (iv) willful misconduct, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages of any kind.""*  

This would ensure that the waiver does **not** protect a party from liability for indirect damages in cases of **IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or intentional wrongdoing**.

ARTICLE 10","This clause is highly relevant to the query regarding **indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
   - The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or speculative damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) unless specific exceptions apply.  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on **indirect damage waivers**, as it limits recovery to direct, probable, and foreseeable damages.

### 2. **Exceptions for Fraud and IP Infringement**  
   - The clause **carves out exceptions** where liability for indirect damages **still applies**:  
     - **Fraudulent conduct** (""in the event of the fraud of a party"").  
     - **Breach of IP obligations** (Article 7, covering third-party IP infringement claims).  
     - **Confidentiality breaches** (Article 10).  
   - This matches the query’s requirement to **exclude fraud and third-party IP infringement** from the waiver.  

### 3. **Third-Party Indemnification**  
   - The clause clarifies that indirect damages **must still be paid if required under indemnification obligations** (e.g., third-party claims covered under Article 9).  
   - This ensures the waiver does not undermine indemnity obligations to third parties, addressing the query’s concern about **third-party IP infringement**.  

### 4. **Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct**  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention ""gross negligence"" or ""willful misconduct,"" its fraud exception and carve-out for breaches of core obligations (IP/confidentiality) implicitly cover **intentional or egregious misconduct**.  
   - Some jurisdictions may interpret ""fraud"" or statutory breaches as encompassing gross negligence, but the clause could be strengthened by **expressly naming these exclusions** if desired.  

### 5. **Clarity on Scope**  
   - The proviso (""FOR CLARITY, [***]"") suggests further specificity (redacted here) may exist to address ambiguities, ensuring the waiver does not inadvertently shield bad-faith acts.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **partially satisfies the query**:  
- It **waives indirect damages** but **excludes fraud, IP breaches, and third-party indemnified claims**.  
- It could be enhanced by **explicitly naming gross negligence/willful misconduct** if jurisdictional enforceability is a concern.  
- The structure ensures accountability for high-risk conduct (fraud/IP) while limiting exposure for ordinary breaches.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE NON-BREACHING PARTY BE ENTITLED TO EQUITABLE OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OF ANY KIND.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query regarding **indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### **1. Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
The clause explicitly waives liability for **indirect, consequential, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits, lost revenue) **unless** the claim arises from:  
- **Gross negligence**  
- **Willful misconduct**  
- **Fraud**  
- **Breaches of specific sections (e.g., Trademarks, Confidentiality, No Agency Relationship)**  

This matches the query’s requirement that such waivers **do not apply** in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

### **2. Third-Party IP Infringement (Indemnification Exception)**  
The clause references **indemnification claims under Section 5**, which likely covers third-party IP infringement claims (e.g., if one party is sued for infringing a third party’s IP due to the other party’s actions).  
- The waiver **does not apply** to indemnification claims, meaning liability for third-party IP claims is **not excluded**.  

### **3. No Injunctive Relief (Unless Exceptions Apply)**  
The clause states that the **non-breaching party cannot seek injunctive relief** (e.g., court orders to stop certain actions) **except** in cases of:  
- **Gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud**  
- **Breaches of key obligations (e.g., Trademarks, Confidentiality, No Agency Relationship)**  

This ensures that **intentional or egregious misconduct** is not shielded from legal remedies.

### **Conclusion**  
The clause effectively:  
✔ **Waives indirect/consequential damages** in most cases.  
✔ **Preserves liability** for fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, and third-party IP claims (via indemnification).  
✔ **Restricts injunctive relief** but allows it in serious breaches.  

This structure aligns with the query’s focus on **excluding liability for indirect damages while maintaining accountability for intentional wrongdoing and third-party IP issues**.

1. **Third-party IP infringement**  
2. **Fraud**  
3. **Gross negligence or willful misconduct**  

### Relevance of the Provided Clause to the Query:  
The **Limitation of Liability** clause (Section 9.3) in the contract partially aligns with the query but does not fully address all the exclusions mentioned. Here’s the breakdown:  

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**  
   - The clause explicitly waives liability for **indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages** (which aligns with the query).  
   - However, this waiver is **not absolute**—it includes exceptions where liability still applies (e.g., breaches of **Article 7 or Section 8.1.5**, and indemnification obligations under **Sections 9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d)**).  

2. **Exclusions for Third-Party IP Infringement, Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - The clause does **not explicitly mention** fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct as exceptions to the waiver.  
   - However, if **Article 7 or Section 8.1.5** (the exceptions listed) cover **representations/warranties related to IP infringement or fraudulent conduct**, then liability for indirect damages in those cases may still apply.  
   - If **gross negligence or willful misconduct** is not carved out in the exceptions, then the waiver **may still shield** a party from liability even in such cases (unless applicable law overrides this).  

### Key Takeaway:  
- The clause **waives indirect damages** broadly but **preserves liability** in specific scenarios (e.g., breaches of certain warranties/indemnities).  
- It does **not explicitly exclude fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** from the waiver, meaning a court might enforce the waiver even in those cases unless:  
  - The exceptions (Article 7, Section 8.1.5, or indemnities) cover such conduct, **or**  
  - Applicable law voids waivers for gross negligence/willful misconduct.  

For full alignment with the query, the clause should **expressly state** that the waiver does not apply to:  
- Third-party IP claims (if not covered under indemnities),  
- Fraud,  
- Gross negligence, or  
- Willful misconduct.

27.3 Acknowledged Direct Damages. Any damages resulting from breach of confidentiality, privacy or data security obligations pursuant to an applicable

The provided **Limitation of Liability clause (Section 27)** addresses these concerns in the following ways:

### **1. Exclusion of Liability for Gross Negligence, Willful Misconduct, and Fraud**  
- **27.1** explicitly states that the limitations of liability **do not apply** in cases of:  
  - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct**  
  - **Fraud**  
  - **Death or personal injury caused by negligence or willful misconduct**  
  - **Any liability that cannot be excluded by law**  
- This means that while indirect/consequential damages are generally waived, **fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct remain fully actionable**.

### **2. Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
- **27.2** broadly excludes liability for **indirect, special, or consequential damages**, even if foreseeable.  
- However, **27.3** clarifies that **breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or data security** are treated as **direct damages** (not indirect/consequential), meaning they are **not waived**.  

### **3. Third-Party IP Infringement (Indemnification Obligations)**  
- While the clause does not explicitly mention **third-party IP infringement**, **27.4 and 27.5** state that **indemnification obligations are excluded from liability caps**.  
- Since IP infringement claims typically fall under **indemnification**, they would **not be waived** under this clause.  

### **4. Liability Caps (But Not for Excluded Conduct)**  
- **27.4 (VF’s Liability Cap):** VF’s liability is capped at the amount paid under the Purchase Order, **except for indemnification and confidentiality breaches**.  
- **27.5 (Supplier’s Liability Cap):** Supplier’s liability is capped at the greater of (a) 3x fees, (b) insurance coverage, or (c) €2M, **except for indemnification, confidentiality breaches, data security breaches, gross negligence, or intentional misconduct**.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **waives indirect damages** (27.2) but **preserves liability** for:  
  - **Fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** (27.1)  
  - **Indemnification (which would cover third-party IP claims)** (27.4 & 27.5)  
  - **Confidentiality/data breaches** (27.3)  
- Thus, it aligns with the query by **excluding indirect damages while maintaining liability for fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, and (implicitly) third-party IP claims via indemnification**.

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages**:  
   The clause explicitly waives liability for categories like ""consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages"" or ""loss of profits."" This is a standard exclusion to limit financial risks for both parties.

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**:  
   The carve-out for **indemnification obligations** (e.g., ""to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless... against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties"") implies that liability for third-party claims—including those involving bodily injury—is **not waived**.  
   - Example: If a third party sues for bodily injury caused by a party’s actions under the agreement, the indemnification obligation would still apply, even if indirect damages between the contracting parties are waived.

3. **No Explicit Exclusion for Personal/Bodily Injury**:  
   The clause does **not** explicitly mention ""personal injury"" or ""bodily injury"" in the waived damages. However:  
   - If such injuries are claimed **by the other party** (not a third party), they might fall under ""incidental"" or ""consequential"" damages, depending on jurisdiction and context.  
   - If claimed by a **third party**, indemnification would likely cover them (unless the indemnity clause itself has exclusions).

4. **Broad Liability Shield**:  
   The waiver applies even in cases of negligence (""sole, joint, or concurrent negligence""), but this is typically interpreted to cover **economic losses**, not personal injury, unless the agreement explicitly includes it.

### Relevance to the Query:
- **Indirect vs. Direct Damages**: Personal/bodily injury is often treated as **direct damages** (not ""indirect""), so the waiver might not apply. However, some jurisdictions could classify certain injury-related losses (e.g., emotional distress) as ""consequential.""  
- **Third-Party Claims**: The clause preserves liability for third-party claims (e.g., a customer injured by a product), so bodily injury claims from outsiders would likely survive the waiver.  
- **Gap in Coverage**: If a party to the agreement suffers bodily injury (e.g., an employee of Party A harmed by Party B’s actions), the waiver’s applicability depends on whether the injury is deemed ""direct"" or excluded by other terms (e.g., a separate insurance or liability clause).

### Practical Takeaway:
The clause **does not explicitly exclude personal/bodily injury claims**, but its focus is on **financial/indirect losses between the parties**. For clarity, parties often add:  
- An **express exclusion for bodily injury** in the waiver, or  
- A **carve-out preserving liability for physical harm** (e.g., ""Notwithstanding the above, this waiver shall not apply to claims for personal injury or property damage"").

Here's how the clause addresses this issue:

### **1. Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**  
The clause broadly waives liability for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including:  
- Lost profits, business interruption, or economic harm.  
- **Injury to property** (but notably **not** personal/bodily injury).  

**Relevance to Query:**  
The exclusion applies to **economic and property-related damages**, but the clause **does not explicitly exclude liability for personal/bodily injury**. This suggests that claims for **physical harm to a person** (e.g., negligence causing bodily injury) **may still be actionable** despite the waiver of other indirect damages.  

---

### **2. Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
This section reinforces the waiver of **economic losses** in tort claims (e.g., negligence, misrepresentation) but includes a **key exception**:  
> *""economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service* ***except personal injury or damage to other tangible property.***""  

**Relevance to Query:**  
- **Personal/bodily injury is explicitly carved out** from the tort waiver.  
- A party **can still sue for physical harm** (e.g., if a defective product causes injury), even though economic losses (e.g., lost profits) are barred.  

---

### **3. Implications for the Query**  
- The clause **waives most indirect damages** (e.g., lost revenue) but **preserves the right to claim compensation for bodily injury**.  
- If a breach of contract or negligence results in **physical harm**, the injured party **may still pursue damages** outside the limitations in Sections 9.2 and 9.5.  
- The **statute of limitations (Section 9.4)** would still apply (2 years from discovery of the claim).  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **explicitly excludes personal/bodily injury from the waiver of indirect and tort-based damages**, meaning such claims remain viable despite the broad limitations on liability. This aligns with common legal standards where parties cannot contractually waive liability for gross negligence or physical harm in many jurisdictions.

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Consequential/Indirect Damages (Section 9.2)**  
   - The clause broadly waives liability for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including economic losses (e.g., lost profits) and **injury to property**.  
   - However, it **does not explicitly mention ""personal or bodily injury""** in the list of excluded damages. This omission is significant because it suggests that claims for bodily injury may **not** be waived under this provision.  

2. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
   - This section explicitly waives tort-based claims (e.g., negligence, strict liability) for **economic losses** but carves out an exception:  
     > *""economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service* **except personal injury or damage to other tangible property.**""  
   - This means:  
     - **Personal/bodily injury claims are preserved** and not waived.  
     - **Damage to tangible property** (e.g., physical harm to assets) is also excluded from the waiver.  

3. **Implications for the Query**  
   - The clause **does not bar claims for personal/bodily injury** arising from torts (e.g., negligence) or defective products/services.  
   - It only limits liability for **economic losses** (e.g., lost profits) and **property damage** (though the latter is ambiguously worded in Section 9.2).  

### Why This Matters:  
- If a party suffers **bodily injury** due to the other party’s actions (e.g., a defective product causing harm), they **can still sue for those damages** despite the waiver of indirect/economic damages.  
- The exception aligns with common legal principles where courts often refuse to enforce waivers for **personal injury** due to public policy concerns.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **explicitly excludes personal injury** from the waiver of tort claims (Section 9.5), meaning such claims remain actionable. However, it broadly waives most other indirect damages (Section 9.2), subject to enforceability under applicable law.

Here’s how the provided clause (Section 27) addresses this:

### **Key Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Exception for Personal/Bodily Injury (27.1)**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability **does not apply** to:  
     - **Death or personal injuries** caused by negligence or wilful misconduct.  
     - Liability arising from **fraud or gross negligence**, which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.  
   - This means that even if the contract waives liability for indirect/consequential damages (27.2), claims for **bodily harm or death due to negligence** are **not waived** and remain actionable.

2. **Indirect Damages Waiver (27.2)**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, special, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm).  
   - However, **27.1 carves out an exception** for personal injury claims, ensuring they are not classified as ""indirect damages"" and thus remain enforceable.

3. **Direct vs. Indirect Damages (27.3)**  
   - While breaches of confidentiality/data security are treated as **direct damages** (and thus recoverable), personal injury claims are **separately protected under 27.1**, overriding any indirect damage waiver.

4. **Limits on Liability (27.4 & 27.5)**  
   - The financial caps on liability (e.g., 3x fees or €2M for the Supplier) **do not apply** to personal injury claims, as these are excluded from limitation under 27.1 and mandatory law.

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause ensures that:  
- **Personal/bodily injury claims** (due to negligence or misconduct) **cannot be waived** as ""indirect damages.""  
- Such claims remain fully actionable, regardless of the general exclusion of indirect/consequential damages.  
- This aligns with legal principles in many jurisdictions where liability for physical harm cannot be contractually limited.

personal or bodily injury exception to indirect damage waiver,0dd1d92b6d,"14. Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages. In any action or proceeding between the Parties (including any arbitration proceeding) arising under or with respect to this Agreement or in any manner pertaining to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or to the relationship of the Parties under this Agreement, each Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and releases any right, power or privilege either may have to claim or receive from the other Party any punitive or exemplary damages, each Party acknowledging and agreeing that the remedies herein provided and other remedies at law or in equity will in all circumstances be adequate. Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The query asks about a **""personal or bodily injury exception to indirect damage waiver""** in the context of the provided clause. Here's how the clause relates to the query:

### **1. Scope of the Waiver (Non-compensatory Damages)**  
The clause broadly waives the right to claim **""punitive or exemplary damages""** (non-compensatory damages) in disputes arising under the agreement. However, it does **not** explicitly waive:  
- **Compensatory damages** (e.g., actual losses, medical expenses, lost wages).  
- **Personal/bodily injury claims**, unless such claims are interpreted as falling under ""punitive or exemplary damages.""  

### **2. Relevance to Personal/Bodily Injury Exception**  
- **No Explicit Exception**: The clause does **not** carve out an exception for personal/bodily injury claims. If a party suffers bodily harm due to the other party’s actions (e.g., negligence at a Hyatt resort), the waiver could **potentially** bar claims for **punitive damages** (e.g., damages meant to punish gross negligence).  
- **But Compensatory Damages Likely Survive**: Courts often interpret such waivers narrowly, meaning compensatory damages (e.g., medical costs) for bodily injury might still be recoverable unless the waiver explicitly includes them.  

### **3. Key Implications for the Query**  
- If the query concerns whether a victim of bodily injury can sue for **punitive damages**, this clause likely **bars** such claims.  
- If the query is about **compensatory damages** (e.g., medical bills, pain and suffering), the clause does **not** clearly waive them unless the agreement elsewhere limits liability for direct harm.  
- **Indirect vs. Direct Damages**: The clause focuses on **non-compensatory** (punitive/exemplary) damages, not indirect/consequential damages (e.g., lost profits). Bodily injury claims are typically **direct damages**, so this waiver may not apply.  

### **4. Potential Gaps/Ambiguities**  
- The clause does **not** explicitly mention ""bodily injury"" or ""personal injury,"" leaving room for interpretation.  
- If the agreement has other clauses limiting liability for **all damages** (including compensatory), those would need review.  

### **Conclusion**  
This waiver primarily targets **punitive damages**, not necessarily compensatory claims for bodily injury. However, if the injured party seeks **punitive damages** (e.g., for gross negligence), this clause would likely block such recovery. For a definitive answer, the full contract and applicable law (which may override such waivers for personal injury) must be reviewed.

Here’s the relevance:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause broadly disclaims liability for **consequential, indirect, punitive, or incidental damages** (even if foreseeable or advised of the possibility).  
   - This applies to claims arising from contract, tort (e.g., negligence), or statutory breaches.  

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   The clause explicitly **excludes two scenarios** from the waiver of indirect damages:  
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: The waiver does **not** limit amounts payable to **third parties** under the indemnities in **Article 10 (Confidentiality)** or Sections 16.1/16.2.  
     - *Relevance to Query*: If a breach of confidentiality (e.g., unauthorized disclosure) leads to third-party claims (e.g., lawsuits by affected parties), the indemnifying party **may still be liable for consequential damages** arising from those claims, despite the general waiver.  
   - **Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct**: The waiver does **not** protect a party acting with **gross negligence or intent**.  
     - *Relevance to Query*: If confidentiality is breached due to gross negligence or willful misconduct (e.g., deliberate leaks), the offending party could be liable for all resulting damages, including indirect/consequential ones (e.g., reputational harm, lost profits).  

### Why This Matters for Confidentiality:  
- **Confidentiality breaches** often lead to **indirect harms** (e.g., loss of business opportunities, reputational damage). The clause generally shields parties from such claims **unless**:  
  - The breach triggers third-party indemnification (e.g., a third party sues due to leaked data).  
  - The breach was caused by **gross negligence or intent** (e.g., reckless handling of secrets).  

### Practical Implications:  
- A party seeking to recover **consequential damages** for a confidentiality breach must prove either:  
  1. The breach falls under **indemnifiable third-party claims** (Article 10/Sections 16.1–16.2), **or**  
  2. The breach involved **gross negligence/willful misconduct**.  

In summary, the clause **limits liability for indirect damages** but **preserves accountability** for confidentiality breaches in high-stakes scenarios (third-party claims or egregious fault). This balances risk allocation while ensuring remedies for serious misconduct.",5

10.5 Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER FROM THE OTHER PARTY ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT; provided however, that this Section 10.5 shall not be construed to limit (a) either Party's right to special, incidental or consequential damages for the other Party's breach of Article 8 or (b) either Party's indemnification rights or obligations under Article 11.","The query asks about **confidentiality exceptions to an indirect damage waiver**, and the provided clause (Section 10.5) directly addresses this by carving out an exception to the general waiver of liability for indirect damages (e.g., consequential, special, or incidental damages) in cases involving a **breach of confidentiality (Article 8)**.  

### Key Relevance:  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party can recover **special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages** arising from the agreement. This is a standard limitation of liability meant to restrict exposure to unpredictable or disproportionate losses.  

2. **Exception for Confidentiality Breaches**:  
   - The **""provided however""** language creates an explicit exception:  
     - If one party breaches **Article 8 (Confidentiality)**, the other party **retains the right to claim** those otherwise-waived damages (special, incidental, or consequential) resulting from the breach.  
     - This exception acknowledges that breaches of confidentiality can lead to hard-to-quantify harms (e.g., reputational damage, lost business opportunities), justifying recovery beyond direct damages.  

3. **Additional Exception for Indemnification**:  
   - The clause also preserves indemnification rights (Article 11), which may cover third-party claims or other liabilities, but this is separate from the confidentiality exception.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause explicitly ties **confidentiality breaches** to an **exception in the indirect damage waiver**, ensuring that a party harmed by unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential information can seek full compensation, including consequential losses (e.g., lost profits due to leaked trade secrets). Without this exception, the injured party might be limited to direct damages only, which could be inadequate for confidentiality breaches.  

**In short:** The clause answers the query by confirming that while indirect damages are generally waived, they remain recoverable for breaches of Article 8 (Confidentiality).",5

However, I’ll explain how this clause interacts with confidentiality and potential exceptions:

### Relevance to the Query:
1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**:  
   The clause broadly waives liability for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential damages) between the parties, **except** in cases involving third-party claims. This means:  
   - Parties cannot sue each other for indirect damages arising from breaches (including confidentiality breaches, if the agreement includes confidentiality obligations).  
   - However, if a third party sues one party for indirect damages (e.g., due to a confidentiality leak), the indemnification obligation survives, and the liable party must cover those third-party claims.  

2. **Confidentiality Exceptions**:  
   While the clause doesn’t explicitly mention confidentiality, its carve-out for third-party claims implies:  
   - If a breach of confidentiality causes indirect harm to a third party (e.g., leaked trade secrets leading to a competitor’s lawsuit), the indemnification exception applies. The waiving party may still be liable for those third-party claims.  
   - Direct claims between the parties for confidentiality breaches (e.g., losses from leaked information) would likely fall under the waiver, barring recovery for indirect damages.  

3. **Key Takeaway**:  
   The clause does not create a blanket exception for confidentiality breaches but preserves liability for indirect damages **only when third parties are involved**. For disputes solely between the contracting parties, indirect damages (even from confidentiality breaches) are waived.  

### Suggested Clarifications:  
If the query is specifically about confidentiality, the agreement should:  
- Explicitly state whether confidentiality breaches are exempt from the waiver.  
- Define if third-party claims related to confidentiality (e.g., privacy lawsuits) trigger indemnification under this clause.

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query**  
The **Limitation of Liability clause (11.5)** explicitly carves out **two exceptions** where the waiver of indirect damages **does not apply**:  
1. **Breach of Confidentiality (Article 12)**  
2. **Breach of Indemnification Obligations (Article 11)**  

#### **Key Takeaways for the Query:**  
- **General Rule:** The clause waives liability for **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business opportunities) arising from the agreement.  
- **Exception for Confidentiality:** If a party breaches its **confidentiality obligations (Article 12)**, the waiver **does not apply**, meaning the breaching party **can still be held liable** for indirect damages resulting from that breach.  
  - *Example:* If Party A improperly discloses Party B’s trade secrets, and Party B suffers lost revenue due to the leak, Party B could sue for those indirect damages despite the general limitation.  
- **Exception for Indemnification:** Similarly, breaches of indemnification obligations (e.g., failing to defend a third-party claim) also allow claims for indirect damages.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **directly answers the query** by confirming that **confidentiality breaches are an exception** to the waiver of indirect damages. If a party violates confidentiality, the other party retains the right to pursue consequential damages (e.g., lost profits) tied to that breach.

The provided clause (Section 13.3) is directly relevant because it explicitly carves out exceptions to the general waiver of liability for indirect damages. Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause states that neither party is liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or special damages (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) even if warned about such risks. This is a broad limitation of liability.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   The waiver **does not apply** to two specific obligations:  
   - **Confidentiality obligations** (under Section 12): If a breach of confidentiality occurs, the injured party **can still claim indirect damages** (e.g., reputational harm, lost opportunities) arising from that breach.  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (under Section 13): Claims covered by indemnity (e.g., third-party lawsuits) are also exempt from the indirect damages waiver.  

3. **Statutory Rights Preserved**:  
   The clause acknowledges that local laws may override contractual limitations, ensuring compliance with mandatory liability rules (e.g., consumer protection laws that prohibit waivers of certain damages).

### Relevance to the Query:
The clause answers the query by clarifying that **confidentiality breaches are excluded from the indirect damage waiver**. If a party violates Section 12 (Confidentiality), the other party retains the right to pursue **all types of damages**, including indirect/consequential damages that would otherwise be waived under Section 13.3. This exception is critical for protecting sensitive information and ensuring accountability for leaks.

### Practical Implication:
- **For confidentiality breaches**: The injured party can seek compensation for broader harms (e.g., lost business due to leaked trade secrets).  
- **For other breaches**: Only direct damages are recoverable; indirect losses are waived unless falling under indemnity or confidentiality.  

This balance limits liability for ordinary breaches while preserving stronger remedies for high-stakes obligations like confidentiality.",5

Here’s how the clauses address this:

### **1. Carveout for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
The clauses explicitly **exclude** fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct from limitations on liability for indirect/consequential damages and aggregate liability caps. Specifically:  
- **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** states that the waiver of liability for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential damages) **does not apply** if the damages arise from a party’s **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsection (E)).  
- **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** similarly excludes fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection (a)(V)) from the cap on aggregate liability.  

This means:  
- If a party engages in **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**, the other party **can still claim consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) and **is not bound by the liability cap**.  
- These carveouts ensure that a party cannot shield itself from full liability for **intentional or egregious wrongdoing**.  

### **2. Indemnification Link**  
- **Sections 12.1 and 12.2** reinforce this by requiring indemnification for Claims/Losses arising from **negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct**.  
- Indemnification obligations (Article 12) are also **excluded from the liability cap** (Section 11.7(a)(VI)), meaning a party must fully cover losses caused by its misconduct.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clauses directly address the query by:  
1. **Carving out fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct** from waivers of indirect damages (Section 11.6).  
2. **Exempting such misconduct from liability caps** (Section 11.7).  
3. **Mandating indemnification** for misconduct-related claims (Sections 12.1–12.2).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The contract ensures that a party **cannot avoid liability** for indirect damages or rely on liability limits if its actions involve **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**. This protects the innocent party while discouraging bad-faith behavior.

Here’s how the provided clauses address this:

### **Key Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Carveout for Fraud/Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct (Section 11.6 & 11.7)**  
   - The **general waiver of consequential damages** (Section 11.6) excludes liability for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) **unless** the damages arise from specific exceptions, including:  
     - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (**subsection (E)**.  
     - Breach of confidentiality or indemnification obligations (other subsections).  
   - Similarly, the **aggregate liability cap** (Section 11.7) does **not apply** to claims involving fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (**subsection (a)(V)**.  

   **Effect**: A party **can still be held liable for indirect damages** if they result from fraud, gross negligence, or intentional wrongdoing, despite the broad limitation of liability elsewhere in the contract.

2. **Indemnification Link (Article 12)**  
   - The indemnification clauses (Sections 12.1 and 12.2) explicitly cover losses arising from a party’s **negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct**.  
   - These indemnification obligations are **also carved out** from the liability cap (Section 11.7(a)(VI)), meaning the liable party’s exposure is **uncapped** for such conduct.  

### **Why This Matters for the Query:**
- The clauses ensure that while the parties broadly waive liability for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits), **intentional or egregious misconduct** (fraud, gross negligence, willful acts) is **not shielded**.  
- This carveout aligns with common legal principles: courts often refuse to enforce liability waivers for intentional wrongdoing or reckless behavior.  
- The indemnification provisions reinforce this by requiring the at-fault party to cover third-party claims stemming from such misconduct.  

### **Practical Implications:**
- A party engaging in fraud or gross negligence **cannot hide behind the contract’s liability limits**—they remain fully exposed to claims for direct **and** indirect damages.  
- The carveout acts as a **deterrent** against bad-faith conduct while preserving the contract’s risk allocation for ordinary breaches or negligence.

Here’s how the provided clauses (Sections 11.6 and 11.7) address this:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Carveout for Fraud/Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct**  
   - Both clauses explicitly **exclude** fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct from the general waiver of liability for **indirect/consequential damages** (Section 11.6) and the **aggregate liability cap** (Section 11.7).  
   - This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they **cannot rely on the contract’s limitations** to avoid liability for:  
     - Indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential damages) under Section 11.6.  
     - The monetary cap on liability under Section 11.7.  

2. **Structure of the Carveout**  
   - **Section 11.6**: The waiver of consequential damages does not apply to claims arising from fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct (listed in subsection (E)).  
   - **Section 11.7**: The aggregate liability cap does not apply to fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct (listed in subsection (a)(V)).  

3. **Purpose**  
   - These carveouts ensure that a party cannot shield itself from **full liability** for intentional or egregious wrongdoing. Courts and jurisdictions often uphold such exceptions because public policy discourages parties from contractually limiting liability for deliberate or reckless misconduct.  

### Practical Implications:
- A party harmed by another’s fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct can seek **full compensation**, including indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) and amounts beyond the liability cap.  
- The clauses reinforce that the limitations are **not absolute** and preserve remedies for bad-faith conduct.  

### Drafting Note:  
The use of ""***"" suggests redacted portions (likely other carveouts or negotiated terms), but the core carveout for fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct is clearly articulated.  

Let me know if you’d like further analysis on specific terms or jurisdiction-specific considerations.",5
"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct carveout to indirect damage waiver",09b132b7ef,"8. Indemnification. Bioamber and Cargill agree to waive any and all claims against each other for consequential, punitive, incidental, special, or other forms of ""exemplary"" losses whether arising in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, including any losses relating to lost use, lost profits, lost business, damage to reputation, or lost or diminished financing unless such claims are based on a Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.","The clause you provided is a **waiver of indirect damages** (consequential, punitive, incidental, etc.) with a **carveout for gross negligence or willful misconduct**. This directly addresses your query about a **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct carveout to an indirect damage waiver**.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause broadly waives claims for consequential, punitive, incidental, and other indirect losses (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm).  
   - This means neither party can sue the other for these types of damages **unless** an exception applies.  

2. **Carveout for Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** if the damages arise from a party's **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  
   - This means if one party acts with **reckless disregard (gross negligence)** or **intentional wrongdoing (willful misconduct)**, the other party **can still claim indirect damages**.  

3. **Fraud Implication**:  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention **fraud**, **willful misconduct** often encompasses fraudulent behavior (intentional deception for gain).  
   - Courts may interpret **willful misconduct** to include fraud, depending on jurisdiction and context.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
This clause ensures that parties cannot claim indirect damages for ordinary breaches (e.g., mistakes, minor negligence) but **retain the right to sue for indirect damages if the other party acted with gross negligence, willful misconduct, or (likely) fraud**.  

If **fraud** is a critical concern, the clause could be made even clearer by explicitly listing it alongside gross negligence and willful misconduct.

### **Key Relevance to Your Query:**  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
   - The clause broadly disclaims liability for **special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages**, even if foreseeable or if a party was advised of the possibility.  
   - This waiver applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, statutory duty, etc.).  

2. **Exceptions (Carveouts) to the Waiver**  
   - The waiver **does not apply** in cases of:  
     - **Gross negligence**  
     - **Willful misconduct**  
   - This means that if a party causes damages due to **gross negligence or willful misconduct**, they **can still be held liable for indirect/consequential damages**, despite the general waiver.  

3. **Fraud Implication**  
   - While **fraud** is not explicitly mentioned, **willful misconduct** often encompasses fraudulent behavior (intentional wrongdoing).  
   - Some jurisdictions may interpret **gross negligence** as bordering on reckless disregard, which could overlap with fraud in extreme cases.  

4. **Indemnification Exception**  
   - The clause clarifies that the limitation **does not restrict indemnification obligations** under Article 10, Sections 16.1 and 16.2 (which likely cover third-party claims).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **highly relevant** to your query because it:  
- **Excludes liability for indirect damages** in most cases.  
- **Carves out exceptions for gross negligence and willful misconduct** (and, by extension, potentially fraud).  
- Ensures that **intentional or egregious misconduct** does not benefit from the liability shield.  

If **fraud** is a critical concern, you may want to explicitly include it in the carveout (e.g., *""fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct""*) for absolute clarity. Some contracts do this to avoid ambiguity.

The provided clauses (11.6, 11.7, 12.1, and 12.2) address this explicitly. Here’s the breakdown:

### **1. Indirect Damages Waiver (Section 11.6)**
- The clause generally **waives liability** for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages (e.g., lost profits) arising from the agreement.  
- **However, it carves out exceptions** where such damages **are still recoverable**, including:  
  - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection E).  
  - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (subsection F).  
  - Breach of confidentiality (subsection A).  

**Relevance to Query:**  
- The waiver **does not apply** to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct—meaning a party **can still be held liable** for indirect damages stemming from these acts.  
- Ordinary negligence (not ""gross"") is **not** carved out, so indirect damages from simple negligence **would likely be waived**.  

---

### **2. Liability Cap (Section 11.7)**
- The clause imposes an **aggregate liability cap** for claims under the agreement.  
- **Exceptions to the cap** include:  
  - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection V).  
  - Indemnification obligations (subsection VI).  

**Relevance to Query:**  
- Liability for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct is **uncapped**, meaning full damages (direct and indirect) can be sought.  

---

### **3. Indemnification (Sections 12.1 & 12.2)**
- Both parties must indemnify each other for third-party claims, including those arising from:  
  - Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.  
  - Personal injury (e.g., worker’s compensation claims under 12.1(d) and 12.2(d)).  

**Relevance to Query:**  
- Indemnification obligations **override** the indirect damages waiver and liability cap for covered claims (e.g., third-party personal injury claims).  
- Fraud and gross negligence are **expressly preserved** as bases for indemnification.  

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Fraud & Gross Negligence:** The waiver **does not apply**—full liability (including indirect damages) remains.  
- **Ordinary Negligence:** The waiver **likely applies** (unless tied to indemnification or another exception).  
- **Personal Injury:** If arising from a third-party claim (e.g., employee injury), indemnification applies, overriding the waiver. If it’s a direct claim between parties, the waiver may apply unless linked to fraud/gross negligence.  

Thus, the clause **limits liability for ordinary negligence** but **preserves it for fraud, gross negligence, and indemnified claims (like personal injury)**.",5

- **However, it carves out exceptions where such damages are still recoverable, including:**

such liability may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.
27.2 Indirect Damages. In no event will either PARTY be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages in any way related to a relevant

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  

1. **Indirect Damages Waiver (27.2)**  
   - The clause states that **neither party** will be liable for **indirect, special, or consequential damages**, even if foreseeable.  
   - However, this waiver **does not apply** to:  
     - **Fraud** (explicitly carved out in **27.1**)  
     - **Gross negligence or wilful misconduct** (also excluded from liability limitations in **27.1**)  
     - **Personal injury or death caused by negligence or wilful misconduct** (also excluded in **27.1**)  

2. **Exceptions to Liability Limitations (27.1)**  
   - The clause **preserves liability** for:  
     - **Fraud**  
     - **Gross negligence or wilful misconduct**  
     - **Personal injury or death caused by negligence/wilful misconduct**  
   - These exceptions mean that a party **can still be held liable** for these types of claims, **even if indirect damages are otherwise waived**.  

3. **Supplier’s Liability (27.5)**  
   - The Supplier’s limitation of liability **does not apply** to:  
     - **Gross negligence or intentional misconduct** (aligning with **27.1**)  
     - **Fraud** (implied under **27.1**)  
   - Thus, the Supplier **can be held fully liable** for fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury claims, **including indirect damages** arising from such conduct.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The **indirect damages waiver (27.2) does not protect a party from liability** for:  
- **Fraud**  
- **Gross negligence or wilful misconduct**  
- **Personal injury or death caused by negligence/wilful misconduct**  

These exceptions are explicitly preserved in **27.1**, meaning that a party **can still be sued for indirect damages** if they arise from fraud, negligence, or personal injury.

ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided (Section 9.5 ""Limitation of Liability"") is directly relevant to the query about whether an **indirect damages waiver applies to liability for fraud, negligence, or personal injury**. Here’s the breakdown:

### 1. **Indirect Damages Waiver**  
The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, and other non-foreseeable damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) arising from:
   - Contract breaches,
   - Tort (including negligence),
   - Breach of statutory duty, or  
   - Other legal theories.  

This waiver applies **unless** an exception (discussed below) applies.

### 2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**  
The clause carves out two key scenarios where the waiver **does not apply**, meaning liability for indirect damages **could still arise**:
   - **(I) Fraud**: The waiver **does not protect a party from liability for its own fraud**. If a party commits fraud, it can still be held liable for all damages (including indirect/consequential damages).  
   - **(II) Third-Party Indemnified Claims**: If a party is required to indemnify the other for a third-party claim (under Article 9), the waiver does not shield them from paying indirect damages to that third party.  

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - **Fraud**: The clause explicitly **preserves liability for fraud**, so the indirect damages waiver does not apply to fraudulent acts.  
   - **Negligence**: The waiver **does apply to negligence** (since negligence is listed under ""tort"" and is not exempted like fraud). A party cannot claim indirect damages for the other party’s negligence unless an exception (e.g., indemnification) applies.  
   - **Personal Injury**: The clause does not explicitly mention personal injury, but such claims typically arise from tort (e.g., negligence). Since negligence-based claims are subject to the waiver, personal injury claims **might be barred** unless they fall under fraud or a statutory exception (e.g., if personal injury is caused by fraud or a breach of confidentiality/IP obligations under Articles 7/10).  

### 4. **Key Takeaway**  
The clause **waives indirect damages for negligence and most torts** but **excludes fraud** from this protection. Personal injury claims would likely be treated like negligence claims (waived) unless linked to fraud or an indemnified third-party claim.  

**Practical Implications**:  
- A party suing for negligence cannot recover indirect damages (e.g., lost profits).  
- A party suing for fraud can recover all damages, including indirect ones.  
- Personal injury claims may face hurdles unless tied to fraud or indemnification.

Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Indemnification for Bodily Injury/Personal Injury**  
   - Section 9.1(a) explicitly includes indemnification for third-party claims involving **""injury to or death of a person""** (i.e., bodily/personal injury) arising from the indemnifying party’s breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.  
   - This means that even if the agreement includes a general waiver of indirect/consequential damages elsewhere, indemnification obligations for bodily injury are **carved out** and preserved here.

2. **No Waiver of Liability for Personal Injury**  
   - The clause ensures that claims for bodily injury are **not waived** under the indemnification framework, even if indirect damages are otherwise disclaimed in the agreement.  
   - The phrase **""to the extent resulting directly or indirectly""** broadens the scope to cover both direct and indirect consequences of the indemnifying party’s actions (e.g., a chain of events leading to injury).

3. **Exception for Unenforceability Under Law**  
   - The carveout is further reinforced by the exception stating that indemnification is void if unenforceable under applicable law. Many jurisdictions **prohibit waivers of liability for personal injury** (e.g., gross negligence or intentional harm), so this clause aligns with legal safeguards.

4. **Claims Procedure for Injury-Related Losses**  
   - The detailed claims process (Section 9.1(b)) applies to bodily injury claims, ensuring they are handled with specific protections (e.g., indemnifying party controls defense but cannot settle without consent unless certain conditions are met).  

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause acts as a **carveout** to preserve liability for bodily injury, even if indirect damages are waived elsewhere in the contract.  
- It ensures compliance with legal standards that often **prohibit waivers for personal injury claims**, especially those involving negligence or misconduct.  
- The broad language (""directly or indirectly"") captures both proximate and remote causes of injury, leaving little room for the indemnifying party to avoid responsibility.  

### Practical Implication:
If a third party sues for bodily injury caused by a party’s negligence under the agreement, the indemnification clause **overrides any general waiver of indirect damages**, requiring the at-fault party to cover the losses (including legal fees and settlements). This is a critical protection for the injured party and aligns with public policy favoring accountability for physical harm.

personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout,469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The query asks about the **""personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout.""** Here’s how the provided **Section 24.0 (General Indemnification)** is relevant to this question:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Bodily Injury as a Carveout from Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - Many contracts include a broad waiver of **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm). However, such waivers often **carve out exceptions** for certain liabilities, including **bodily injury or personal injury claims**.  
   - This clause explicitly **preserves indemnification for bodily injury (including death)**, meaning such claims are **not waived even if indirect damages are otherwise excluded** elsewhere in the contract.  

2. **Indemnification for Bodily Injury**  
   - The clause obligates each party to indemnify the other for third-party claims arising from **bodily injury or tangible property damage** caused by the indemnifying party’s **negligence or intentional acts**.  
   - This ensures that **liability for physical harm** (a subset of ""direct damages"") is **expressly allocated** to the at-fault party, overriding any general waiver of indirect damages.  

3. **Comparative Fault Provision**  
   - If the indemnified party or a third party contributed to the injury, liability is **proportionally allocated** based on fault. This mitigates the risk of a party being fully indemnified for harms they partly caused.  

4. **Conditions for Indemnification**  
   - The indemnified party must **promptly notify** the indemnifying party and **cooperate in the defense**, ensuring the indemnifying party retains control over the claim.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- The clause **carves out bodily injury** from any broader contractual limitations on liability (e.g., a waiver of indirect damages), ensuring such claims remain enforceable.  
- It aligns with common legal norms where **personal injury liabilities** are treated as **non-waivable** or subject to stricter accountability.  

### Practical Implication:  
Even if the contract elsewhere states that neither party is liable for **indirect/consequential damages**, this indemnification clause **overrides that waiver for bodily injury claims**, ensuring they are **specifically covered**.

No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits.

12.4 Limitation on Liability.

### 1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits).  
   - However, it **carves out an exception for indemnifiable losses**, meaning indemnification obligations (e.g., under a separate indemnity section) can still cover such damages if they qualify as ""Indemnifiable Loss.""  

### 2. **Indemnification Carveout Relevance**  
   - If **personal or bodily injury** is defined as an **""Indemnifiable Loss""** elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., in an indemnity clause covering third-party claims for bodily injury), the carveout in Section 12.3 ensures that the waiver of indirect damages **does not apply to such claims**.  
   - Thus, a party could still seek indemnification for bodily injury-related damages (even if they are indirect/consequential) if the indemnity clause covers them.  

### 3. **Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - While the agreement caps total liability at a specified amount (""$[* * *]""), this cap **does not override indemnification obligations** (per ""whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions"").  
   - If bodily injury claims are covered under indemnity, the cap may not apply (depending on drafting), preserving full recovery for such losses.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **allows indirect damages (like those from bodily injury) to be recoverable if they fall under indemnification**, despite the general waiver in Section 12.3. However, the parties must confirm:  
- Whether **personal/bodily injury** is explicitly included in the definition of **""Indemnifiable Loss.""**  
- Whether the liability cap in Section 12.4 **excludes indemnification claims** (common in well-drafted agreements).  

If the indemnity clause elsewhere covers bodily injury, this structure creates an **exception to the indirect damages waiver** for such claims.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout,980a304336,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits. This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The query asks about how **personal or bodily injury** is treated under an exception to the waiver of indirect damages, specifically via an **indemnification carveout**. Here’s how the provided clauses address this:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages (12.3)**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for *indirect, consequential, or special damages* (including lost profits).  
   - **Exception**: This exclusion **does not apply to indemnification obligations** (i.e., indemnifiable losses are still subject to liability, even if they involve indirect damages).  

2. **Limitation on Liability (12.4)**  
   - Caps each party’s total liability at a specified amount (redacted as $[* * *]).  
   - Applies to **all claims**, including those arising from indemnification (Section 12) or tort (e.g., negligence).  

### Relevance to the Query:
- **Indemnification Carveout**: The exception in 12.3 ensures that indemnification claims (e.g., for third-party bodily injury claims under an indemnity obligation) **are not barred by the indirect damages waiver**. If a third party sues for personal injury, and the indemnifying party must cover those losses, such damages would likely qualify as ""Indemnifiable Losses"" and thus fall outside the indirect damages exclusion.  
- **Bodily Injury Implications**:  
  - If the indemnity clause covers third-party bodily injury claims (common in contracts), the carveout preserves the indemnitor’s liability for such damages despite the general waiver of indirect/consequential damages.  
  - However, 12.4’s **aggregate liability cap** would still limit the total exposure, even for indemnifiable bodily injury claims, unless another provision (e.g., a separate indemnity cap) overrides it.  

### Potential Gaps:
- The clause does not **explicitly** mention ""personal or bodily injury,"" so its applicability depends on whether such claims are deemed ""Indemnifiable Losses"" under the agreement’s definitions.  
- The liability cap in 12.4 could conflict with statutory or common law rules that prohibit limiting liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or certain personal injury claims.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **allows indemnification claims (including for bodily injury) to bypass the indirect damages waiver** but subjects them to the overarching liability cap. For full clarity, the contract should define ""Indemnifiable Losses"" to explicitly include bodily injury or carve it out separately from limitations.

   - The clause broadly requires the franchisee to indemnify the franchisor (and related parties) for **""any and all losses and expenses""** arising from claims tied to the franchisee’s operations, including **indirect damages** (e.g., compensatory, punitive, reputational harm, etc.).  
   - However, the clause does **not explicitly waive indirect damages**—it instead shifts liability for them to the franchisee via indemnification.  

### 2. **Carveout for Gross Negligence**  
   - The indemnification obligation **does not apply to liability arising from the franchisor’s gross negligence** (unless joint liability is involved).  
   - This acts as a **limited carveout**, but it does not specifically address **bodily injury or personal injury claims**.  

### 3. **Relevance to Personal/Bodily Injury Exception**  
   - The clause covers claims **""arising from the operation of the Franchised Business,""** which could include bodily injury (e.g., accidents involving vehicles or premises).  
   - However, there is **no explicit exception** for bodily/personal injury claims. Instead, such claims would likely fall under the broad indemnification obligation unless:  
     - They result from the franchisor’s **gross negligence** (carveout applies).  
     - Applicable law prohibits indemnification for bodily injury (e.g., some states bar indemnity for one’s own negligence in personal injury cases).  

### 4. **Key Takeaways**  
   - The clause **does not expressly exclude bodily/personal injury claims** from indemnification.  
   - It indirectly addresses such claims by:  
     - Requiring indemnification for all losses tied to franchisee operations (potentially including injury claims).  
     - Excluding gross negligence by the franchisor (which could shield the franchisor if their negligence caused the injury).  
   - If the query assumes a **separate waiver of indirect damages** elsewhere in the contract, this indemnification clause would **override that waiver** for covered claims (since it affirmatively requires indemnification).  

### Practical Implications  
   - Franchisees could be on the hook for **indirect damages** (e.g., medical costs, pain/suffering) tied to bodily injury claims unless:  
     1. The injury resulted from the franchisor’s gross negligence.  
     2. State law invalidates such indemnification for personal injury.  
   - The clause is **franchisor-friendly** and places significant liability risk on the franchisee.

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, punitive, lost profits) between the parties (""first-party claims""). This means neither party can sue the other for these types of damages arising from breaches of the agreement.

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**:  
   The **""provided, however""** exception clarifies that the waiver **does not apply** to indemnification obligations for claims brought by **unaffiliated third parties**. For example:  
   - If a third party sues Party A for indirect damages (e.g., consequential harm caused by Party A’s actions), Party B can still seek indemnification from Party A for those third-party claims, even though Party B itself could not directly claim such damages from Party A under the agreement.  

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - The clause **does not create an exception for first-party claims** (claims between the contracting parties). The waiver of indirect damages remains absolute for disputes directly between them.  
   - The only exception is for **third-party claims**, where indemnification rights survive. Thus, there is **no carve-out allowing first parties to recover indirect damages from each other**.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause strictly bars first-party claims for indirect damages but preserves indemnification rights for third-party claims (even if those third parties seek indirect damages). The query’s focus on a ""first party claim exception"" is **not supported** by the clause—it contains no such exception. Any indirect damages between the parties are waived without qualification.

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
The provided clause (Section 10) is a **broad mutual waiver of indirect damages**, meaning **both parties** agree not to claim or hold each other liable for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or consequential losses).  

However, the clause does **not** explicitly include any **exceptions** allowing the **first party** (or either party) to still claim indirect damages under certain conditions. Therefore:  
- **If the query seeks an exception for the first party**, this clause does **not** provide one—it applies equally to both parties.  
- **If the query assumes an exception exists**, the clause would need modification (e.g., carve-outs for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or specific liabilities like IP infringement).  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
As written, the clause is **strictly mutual** and **absolute**—neither party can claim indirect damages. If the first party wants an exception, the clause must be revised to include qualifying language (e.g., *""except in cases of fraud or breach of confidentiality""*).

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party will be liable to the other for **indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits) arising from breaches of the agreement, except in two narrow exceptions:
     1. **Breach of Confidentiality (Section 11)**: Indirect damages are not waived for confidentiality breaches.
     2. **Third-Party Claims**: If a third party sues one party and wins an award for indirect damages, the other party may still be liable for those damages under indemnification obligations.

2. **First-Party Claims vs. Third-Party Claims**:  
   - The clause explicitly **waives indirect damages for first-party claims** (direct disputes between the two contracting parties).  
   - However, it **carves out an exception for third-party claims** (e.g., if a customer sues Party A for indirect damages, and Party A seeks indemnification from Party B under the agreement, Party B could still be on the hook for those third-party-awarded indirect damages).

3. **No First-Party Exception for Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause does **not** provide an exception for first-party claims (claims between the contracting parties themselves) unless the damages arise from a breach of confidentiality or are mandated by law (""Applicable Law"").  
   - Thus, in a **first-party dispute**, the waiver of indirect damages is **broad and enforceable**, absent a confidentiality breach or legal requirement.

### Relevance to the Query:
The clause confirms that **first-party claims generally cannot recover indirect damages** (per the waiver), with the only exceptions being:  
- Confidentiality breaches.  
- Where applicable law prohibits such a waiver.  

For **third-party claims**, the waiver does not apply to indemnified liabilities (e.g., if a third party wins indirect damages against Party A, Party B may still owe those under indemnification).  

### Practical Implications:
- If Party A sues Party B directly (first-party claim), Party A likely **cannot recover indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits) unless confidentiality was breached.  
- If a third party sues Party A and wins indirect damages, Party B may still be liable for those under its indemnity obligations.  

This structure is common in contracts to limit exposure between the parties while preserving indemnification rights for third-party risks.",5

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages:**  
   The clause broadly waives liability for **consequential, incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, and similar damages** arising from the agreement, even if caused by negligence or fault of the waiving party.

2. **Key Exception:**  
   The waiver **does not apply** to:  
   > *""OBLIGATIONS TO INDEMNIFY A PARTY FOR CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES""*  
   This means that if one party must indemnify (compensate) the other for **third-party claims** (e.g., lawsuits from customers, regulators, etc.), the waiver of indirect damages **does not apply**—meaning indemnification could still cover such damages.

3. **Implication for First-Party Claims:**  
   - The clause **does not** explicitly carve out an exception for **first-party claims** (direct disputes between the two contracting parties).  
   - Therefore, **indirect damages are fully waived** in first-party disputes, unless another provision in the agreement creates an exception.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **does not provide an exception** for first-party claims to recover indirect damages. The only exception is for **third-party indemnification claims**. Thus, in a direct dispute between the parties, neither can recover consequential, incidental, or punitive damages from the other under this clause.  

If the query seeks to **create** such an exception, the clause would need to be revised to explicitly allow it (e.g., by adding language like *""except for claims arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct""*).",5

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the **Provider** (second party) **shall not be liable for any incidental or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, lost revenues), even if the Company (first party) gave advance notice of such potential damages.  
   - This is a broad waiver of indirect damages in favor of the Provider.

2. **Exceptions to Liability Limitations**:  
   The clause carves out **four exceptions** where a party (including the first party, i.e., the Company) can claim **direct damages** despite the general liability cap:  
   - **(a) Bodily injury or death** caused by negligence.  
   - **(b) Damage to real or tangible personal property** caused by negligence.  
   - **(c) Willful or intentional misconduct** (no limitation applies).  
   - **(d) Other direct damages** (capped at the lesser of proven damages or fees paid in the prior 12 months).  

3. **Relevance to ""First Party Claim Exception""**:  
   - While the Provider is shielded from indirect damages, the **Company (first party) retains the right to claim direct damages** under the exceptions listed (a)-(d).  
   - For example, if the Provider’s **negligence** causes bodily injury or property damage, the Company can still sue for **direct damages** (e.g., medical costs, repair costs), even though indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) are waived.  
   - Similarly, **willful misconduct** by the Provider allows the Company to recover **full direct damages** without limitation.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **waives indirect damages** (e.g., consequential losses) for the Provider but **preserves the first party’s (Company’s) right to claim direct damages** in specific scenarios (negligence, willful misconduct, etc.). This creates an **exception for first-party claims** where the harm falls under the enumerated categories (a)-(d), even though indirect damages are otherwise excluded.

The provided clauses (Sections 11.6, 11.7, 12.1, and 12.2) address this issue in the following ways:

### **1. Exclusion of Indirect Damages (Section 11.6)**
- The clause generally **waives liability** for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits) arising from the agreement.  
- However, it **carves out exceptions** where such damages **are recoverable**, including:  
  - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (Subsection E)**  
  - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (Subsection F)**  

This means that if a party engages in **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**, the other party **can still claim indirect damages** despite the general waiver.  

### **2. Liability Cap Exception (Section 11.7)**
- The agreement imposes an **overall liability cap** for claims.  
- However, this cap **does not apply** to:  
  - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (Subsection V)**  
  - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (Subsection VI)**  

Thus, if a party commits fraud or gross negligence, the liability cap **does not shield them** from full exposure, including indirect damages.  

### **3. Indemnification Obligations (Sections 12.1 & 12.2)**
- The indemnification clauses explicitly cover **Losses** (including legal fees and damages) arising from:  
  - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (Sections 12.1(b) and 12.2(b))  
  - **Breach of contract or misrepresentations**  
- Since indemnification claims are **exempt from the waiver of indirect damages (Section 11.6(F))** and the liability cap (Section 11.7(VI)), a party can still recover **full damages** (including consequential losses) for fraud or gross negligence via indemnification.  

### **Relevance to the Query**
The clauses **preserve liability for indirect damages** in cases of **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** by:  
1. **Explicitly excluding** such conduct from the **waiver of consequential damages** (Section 11.6(E)).  
2. **Exempting** such conduct from the **liability cap** (Section 11.7(V)).  
3. **Including** such conduct in **indemnification obligations**, which are **themselves carved out** from the waiver and cap (Sections 12.1(b), 12.2(b), and 11.6(F)).  

Thus, if a party commits fraud or gross negligence, the other party can **bypass the general limitations on damages** and seek **full recovery**, including indirect and consequential losses, either directly or through indemnification.

Here’s how the provided clauses address this:

### **1. Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 11.6)**  
The clause generally excludes liability for **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) but carves out exceptions where such damages **are** recoverable, including:  
- **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (Subsection E)**  
- **Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (Subsection F)**  

**Relevance to Query**:  
- The exclusion of indirect damages **does not apply** if the damages arise from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This ensures that a party engaging in such misconduct cannot shield itself from liability for consequential harm.  
- The carveout for indemnification obligations (Article 12) further ensures that indemnifiable claims (which may include indirect damages) are not barred by this waiver.  

---

### **2. Liability Cap (Section 11.7)**  
The contract imposes an **aggregate liability cap** but explicitly **excludes** from this cap:  
- **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (Subsection V)**  
- **Indemnification obligations (Subsection VI)**  

**Relevance to Query**:  
- Even where liability is otherwise capped, misconduct (fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct) and indemnification claims **are not subject to the cap**, preserving full liability exposure for these categories.  

---

### **3. Indemnification Obligations (Articles 12.1 & 12.2)**  
The indemnification clauses require each party to cover the other’s losses arising from:  
- **Breach of contract/material misrepresentations**  
- **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct**  
- Certain third-party claims (e.g., employee-related claims)  

**Relevance to Query**:  
- **Fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct** are **expressly included** as triggers for indemnification, meaning:  
  - A party guilty of such misconduct **must indemnify the other** for resulting losses (including indirect damages, per Section 11.6’s carveout).  
  - These losses are **exempt from the liability cap** (Section 11.7).  

---

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
1. **Indirect Damages Waiver Exception**:  
   - Fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct **override** the no-consequential-damages clause (Section 11.6(E)).  
   - Indemnification claims **also override** the waiver (Section 11.6(F)), ensuring recoverability of indirect damages tied to indemnifiable events (like misconduct).  

2. **Liability Cap Exception**:  
   - Misconduct and indemnification claims are **uncapped** (Section 11.7(V)–(VI)), exposing the liable party to full damages.  

3. **Indemnification Link**:  
   - Article 12 explicitly ties indemnification to misconduct, ensuring that losses (including indirect damages) stemming from fraud/gross negligence are **fully recoverable** outside the standard limitations.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clauses work together to ensure that:  
- A party engaging in **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** cannot hide behind the contract’s **limitations on indirect damages or liability caps**.  
- Such misconduct is **carved out** from protections and triggers **indemnification obligations**, allowing the aggrieved party to recover **full damages** (direct and indirect).

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### **1. General Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 11.6)**  
The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits) **unless** an exception applies. One such exception is:  
- **Subsection (E):** Damages arising from **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are **not waived**.  
- **Subsection (F):** Damages tied to **indemnification obligations (Article 12)** are also **not waived**.  

This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the other party can still claim **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits) that would otherwise be excluded.  

### **2. Liability Cap Exception (Section 11.7)**  
The contract imposes a **monetary cap** on liability **except** for certain carveouts, including:  
- **Subsection (V):** Claims involving **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are **not subject to the liability cap**.  
- **Subsection (VI):** **Indemnification obligations (Article 12)** are also **exempt from the cap**.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **preserves the right to recover indirect damages** (which are normally waived) when the harm results from **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**.  
- It also ensures that **indemnification claims** (e.g., third-party claims covered under Article 12) are **not restricted** by the general waiver of indirect damages or the liability cap.  
- This creates a **stronger deterrent** against bad-faith conduct while still limiting liability for ordinary breaches.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The **fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct exception** ensures that a party cannot hide behind the **waiver of indirect damages** or the **liability cap** if its actions were intentional or egregious. The **indemnification carveout** further ensures that third-party claims (covered under indemnity) remain fully recoverable.

"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout",469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The query concerns whether **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are exceptions to a waiver of indirect damages through an **indemnification carveout**. Here’s how the provided clause relates to the query:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification**  
The clause requires each party to indemnify the other for third-party claims arising from:  
- **Negligent or intentional acts/omissions** (including bodily injury or property damage).  
- **Proportional liability** applies if the indemnified party or a third party contributed to the harm.  

However, the clause **does not explicitly mention fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**. Instead, it broadly covers ""intentional acts or omissions,"" which could encompass **willful misconduct** (depending on jurisdiction and interpretation).  

### **2. Relevance to the Query**  
- **Fraud/Gross Negligence Carveout?**  
  - The clause does **not expressly exclude fraud or gross negligence** from indemnification.  
  - Some contracts explicitly state that indemnification **survives** even if indirect damages are waived for fraud/gross negligence. Here, that is **not clearly addressed**.  
  - If the contract elsewhere **waives indirect damages**, this indemnity clause may still apply to direct damages (e.g., third-party claims) unless fraud/gross negligence is explicitly excluded.  

- **Willful Misconduct & ""Intentional Acts""**  
  - The clause covers **intentional acts**, which could include **willful misconduct**.  
  - If the indemnified party suffers liability due to the other party’s **intentional wrongdoing**, indemnification may still apply (subject to proportional fault).  

### **3. Key Implications for the Query**  
- **No Explicit Carveout**: Since fraud/gross negligence are not excluded, indemnification may still apply unless another clause (e.g., a limitation of liability) overrides this.  
- **Proportional Liability**: If the indemnified party contributed to the harm (e.g., through its own negligence), recovery could be reduced.  
- **Indemnification vs. Waiver of Damages**: Even if indirect damages are waived elsewhere, this clause may still require indemnification for **direct damages** (e.g., third-party claims) arising from intentional acts.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause **does not clearly carve out fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** from coverage. However, its application depends on:  
1. Whether other contract clauses (e.g., limitation of liability) override it.  
2. Jurisdictional interpretation of ""intentional acts"" (whether it includes willful misconduct).  
3. Whether the damages sought are **direct** (indemnifiable) or **indirect** (potentially waived).

Here’s how the provided clauses address (or fail to address) this issue:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 12.3):**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for *indirect, consequential, or special damages* (including lost profits).  
   - **Exception:** The waiver **does not apply** to indemnification obligations (""Indemnifiable Loss""). This suggests that indirect damages may still be recoverable under indemnification claims.  

2. **Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4):**  
   - Caps each party’s total liability at a specified amount (""$[* * *]"").  
   - The cap applies to **all claims**, including those arising from *negligence* or indemnification (Section 12).  
   - **No explicit carveout for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.**  

### **Relevance to the Query:**
- **Indemnification Carveout (Section 12.3):**  
  The clause allows indirect damages to be claimed **only under indemnification**, but it does not explicitly tie this to fraud/gross negligence. If ""Indemnifiable Loss"" includes losses from fraud or misconduct (e.g., via definitions elsewhere in the agreement), the carveout could indirectly permit such claims.  

- **Liability Cap (Section 12.4):**  
  The cap applies even to indemnification claims, but it is silent on whether fraud/gross negligence would **override the cap**. Many jurisdictions prohibit limiting liability for intentional misconduct, but this clause does not explicitly address that.  

### **Potential Gaps/Issues:**
1. **No Express Exception for Misconduct:**  
   - The clause does not explicitly state that fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct **void the waiver of indirect damages** or the liability cap.  
   - In some jurisdictions, such exclusions may be **unenforceable** for intentional wrongdoing, but the clause does not clarify this.  

2. **Indemnification as a Loophole:**  
   - If ""Indemnifiable Loss"" includes losses from fraud/gross negligence (e.g., third-party claims), the indemnification carveout could allow recovery of indirect damages **despite the general waiver**.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **partially addresses** the query by allowing indirect damages under indemnification but does not explicitly tie this to fraud/gross negligence. The liability cap applies broadly, but its enforceability for intentional misconduct is questionable. For full clarity, the agreement should:  
- Explicitly state whether fraud/gross negligence **overrides the waiver and cap**.  
- Define ""Indemnifiable Loss"" to confirm if it includes misconduct-related claims.

seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses,ff35aa7411,"9. Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties waive and relinquish any claims, demands, causes of action or recoveries for punitive damages, exemplary damages, or statutory damages. Seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the sale of the products, including any lost revenues or profits, consequential and/or incidental damages, business interruption or damage to business reputation, regardless of the theory upon which any claim may be based, including any statutory causes of action or claims. In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","This clause is highly **seller-favorable** in waiving indirect damages, as it significantly limits the seller's liability in multiple ways that benefit the seller:

1. **Broad Waiver of Indirect Damages** – The seller explicitly disclaims liability for **indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages**, including lost profits, business interruption, and reputational harm. This means the buyer cannot recover these types of damages, even if they result from the seller’s breach or negligence.  

2. **Exclusion of Statutory and Punitive Damages** – The clause goes beyond just indirect damages by also waiving **punitive, exemplary, and statutory damages**, which are often sought in disputes to penalize wrongful conduct. This further shields the seller from higher-risk liabilities.  

3. **Strict Cap on Total Liability** – The seller’s maximum liability is limited to the **purchase price paid by the buyer** (or the price of the defective portion, if applicable). This means the buyer cannot recover more than what they paid, even if actual damages (e.g., lost business opportunities) far exceed that amount.  

4. **Survival of Limitation Even if Remedies Fail** – The clause states that the liability cap applies **even if the agreed-upon remedies (e.g., repair/replacement) fail**, reinforcing the seller’s protection.  

### **Why This is Seller-Favorable**  
- The buyer assumes nearly all risk for **business losses** stemming from the seller’s actions.  
- The seller avoids exposure to **open-ended financial risks** (e.g., large consequential damage claims).  
- Courts generally enforce such waivers if clearly drafted, as seen here.  

This type of clause is common in B2B contracts where sellers seek to **minimize unpredictable liabilities** while still offering basic remedies (e.g., refunds or replacements). Buyers, especially in high-stakes deals, may push back to carve out exceptions (e.g., for gross negligence or willful misconduct).

seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses,f52cb3b7ad,"IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER’S OR SELLER’S LIABILITY, ONE TO THE OTHER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE RESPECTIVE OTHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD 13 MILLION; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BAD FAITH, INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","This clause is relevant to the query about a **seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages** in the following ways:  

### 1. **Limitation of Liability (Seller-Favorable Cap)**  
   - The clause caps **both parties' liability** at **USD 13 million** for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, or other obligations.  
   - This benefits the **seller** by limiting their exposure to direct damages (e.g., costs of non-conforming goods/services) while also indirectly restricting **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) since such damages would typically fall under the broader ""liability arising out of"" the agreement.  

### 2. **No Explicit Waiver of Indirect Damages, but Implicit Effect**  
   - While the clause does **not explicitly waive indirect damages**, the **cap on liability** effectively limits the buyer’s ability to recover such damages unless they exceed the USD 13 million threshold.  
   - A true **seller-favorable waiver** would explicitly exclude **consequential, incidental, or indirect damages**, but this clause achieves a similar result by imposing a strict monetary limit.  

### 3. **Exceptions Favor the Seller**  
   - The carve-outs for **bad faith, willful misconduct, or third-party injury/property damage** ensure the seller is **not protected** in cases of egregious conduct.  
   - However, since most breaches (e.g., delivery delays, quality issues) would fall under the **capped liability**, the seller is shielded from excessive claims.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **seller-favorable** because:  
   - It imposes a **hard cap on liability**, indirectly limiting indirect damages.  
   - It does **not explicitly exclude indirect damages**, but the cap serves a similar protective function.  
   - The exceptions are narrow (focused on intentional misconduct or third-party harm), preserving the seller’s broader protections.  

For a stronger **waiver of indirect damages**, the clause could explicitly state:  
*""Neither party shall be liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, or punitive damages arising from breaches of this agreement.""*  
However, the current structure still heavily favors the seller by capping exposure.

Here’s how the clause aligns with a seller-favorable position:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Broad Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**  
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for **indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, or data), even if the party was advised of the possibility of such damages.  
   - This protects the seller from claims for business disruptions or downstream losses suffered by the buyer, which are typically harder to quantify and can be substantial.  
   - Exceptions (indemnification for third-party claims or breaches of confidentiality) are narrow, preserving the waiver’s broad protection.

2. **Carve-Out for Liquidated Damages (Seller Benefit)**  
   - The clause clarifies that the waiver does not limit the seller’s right to **liquidated damages** (Section 10.5.2), which are often a predefined, capped amount. This ensures the seller retains a predictable remedy for certain breaches without exposure to uncapped liability.

3. **Aggregate Liability Cap (Section 8.3)**  
   - The seller’s total liability (except for indemnification claims) is capped at a specified amount (redacted as `[***]`). This provides a financial safety net, preventing catastrophic exposure.  
   - Indemnification obligations (e.g., for third-party claims) are excluded from the cap, but the seller’s direct liability for breaches of the agreement is strictly limited.

### Why This is Seller-Favorable:
- **Risk Allocation:** The buyer bears the risk of indirect losses (e.g., lost profits), while the seller’s liability is confined to direct damages and capped.  
- **Predictability:** The seller can quantify maximum exposure (via the liability cap) and avoid open-ended consequential damage claims.  
- **Strategic Exceptions:** The exceptions (indemnity, confidentiality breaches) are narrowly tailored to address high-priority risks without undermining the overall waiver.  

### Contrast with Buyer-Favorable Terms:
A buyer-favorable version might:  
- Allow consequential damages for gross negligence/willful misconduct.  
- Exclude lost profits from the waiver.  
- Set a higher (or no) liability cap for the seller.  

This clause is **strongly protective of the seller** by systematically eliminating or capping high-risk liabilities.",5

Here’s how it aligns with the request:

### **1. Broad Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
The clause explicitly **excludes** liability for:  
- **Consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption)  
- **Incidental damages**  
- **Special damages**  
- **Other indirect damages**  

This is a strong **seller-protective provision**, as it shields the seller (and buyer, but typically sellers face higher risk) from claims for hard-to-quantify, downstream losses.  

### **2. Knowledge-Based Exception Removed**  
The clause states that indirect damages are excluded **even if the party knew such damages were likely**. This is **pro-seller** because it prevents the other party from arguing that foreseeability should create liability.  

### **3. Carve-Outs Favor the Seller**  
- **Direct damages** are capped at **$15 million**, which limits exposure.  
- The **only exception** to the indirect damages waiver is for third-party claims involving **personal injury or tangible property damage caused by a product** (likely tied to product liability laws, which are harder to contractually waive).  

### **4. Comparison to Buyer-Favorable Terms**  
A **buyer-favorable** version might:  
- Allow indirect damages for **breach of core obligations** (e.g., IP infringement).  
- Include **exceptions for gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  
- Permit indirect damages if **foreseeable**.  

This clause **omits those buyer protections**, making it **seller-favorable**.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause strongly favors the **seller** by:  
- **Eliminating most indirect damages claims** (even if foreseeable).  
- **Capping direct damages** at a defined amount.  
- **Limiting exceptions** to narrow scenarios (e.g., third-party bodily injury).

THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY BUYER TO SUPPLIER UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM.","This clause is a **seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages** because it limits the seller's (Supplier's) liability in several key ways that benefit the seller:

### 1. **Broad Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for **indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages**, which are typically the most significant and unpredictable types of claims (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, or data loss).  
   - This protects the seller from high-risk exposures that could arise from breaches or failures under the agreement.  

### 2. **No Exceptions for Negligence or Awareness**  
   - The waiver applies **even if the seller was advised of the possibility of such damages**, meaning the buyer cannot argue that the seller acted recklessly or knowingly.  
   - This strengthens the seller’s position by making the waiver nearly absolute.  

### 3. **Cap on Total Liability**  
   - The seller’s total liability is capped at the **amounts paid/payable by the buyer in the 12 months preceding the claim**.  
   - This ensures the seller’s exposure is limited to a predictable, contractually defined amount, reducing financial risk.  

### **Why This is Seller-Favorable**  
- The clause shifts risk to the buyer by eliminating recovery for consequential losses (which often exceed direct damages).  
- The liability cap prevents catastrophic exposure, even for direct damages.  
- It applies **mutually**, but in practice, sellers (Suppliers) are more likely to face claims for indirect damages (e.g., downstream losses from product failures), making this protection disproportionately beneficial to them.  

### **Buyer Considerations**  
A buyer might push back by:  
- Carving out exceptions for **gross negligence, willful misconduct, or IP breaches**.  
- Excluding **third-party claims** (e.g., indemnified claims from the buyer’s customers).  
- Negotiating a higher liability cap or removing it for certain breaches.

Below is an analysis of how the clause relates to the query:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause (Seller-Favorable)**
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - The clause explicitly waives claims for **indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, reputational harm).  
   - This is **seller-protective**, as it shields the seller from high-risk financial exposures beyond direct losses.  

2. **Cap on Liability**  
   - Seller’s total liability is **capped at the purchase price paid** (or the price of the defective portion, if lower).  
   - This further limits the buyer’s recourse, making it difficult to recover significant losses.  

3. **Waiver of Punitive/Statutory Damages**  
   - The clause also eliminates claims for **punitive, exemplary, or statutory damages**, which are often used to penalize bad actors.  

### **Why This is NOT Buyer-Favorable**
- A **buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages** would typically:  
  - **Exclude** the waiver of consequential damages for the buyer (allowing the buyer to claim lost profits or other indirect losses).  
  - **Include** a reciprocal waiver protecting the buyer from seller claims for indirect damages.  
  - **Remove or raise the liability cap** (or make it mutual).  

### **Suggested Buyer-Friendly Revisions**
To make this clause more **buyer-favorable**, the buyer could negotiate:  
1. **Carve-Outs for Buyer Claims**  
   - *Example:* *""Notwithstanding the above, Buyer shall not be precluded from claiming consequential damages arising from Seller’s breach of confidentiality, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.""*  

2. **Mutual Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - *Example:* *""Neither party shall be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, except for [specific exceptions].""*  

3. **Higher Liability Cap for Seller**  
   - *Example:* *""Seller’s liability shall not exceed [2-3x] the purchase price paid.""*  

### **Conclusion**  
The current clause is **heavily skewed in favor of the seller**, as it broadly waives indirect damages and imposes a strict liability cap. A **buyer-favorable** version would either **narrow the waiver** or **make it mutual**, while allowing exceptions for certain breaches.

Here’s a breakdown of how it aligns with a buyer-favorable approach:

### **1. Broad Waiver of Indirect Damages (Buyer Protection)**
   - **Section 8.2** explicitly excludes liability for **indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, lost revenue, business interruption, or data loss).  
   - This means the **buyer cannot be held liable** for these types of damages even if they result from a breach of contract, negligence, or other legal theories.  
   - **Exceptions** (where liability remains) are narrow:  
     - Third-party claims covered under indemnification (**Section 7.2**).  
     - Breaches of confidentiality (**Section 11.4**).  
     - Liquidated damages explicitly allowed under **Section 10.5.2**.  

   → This structure **protects the buyer** from unpredictable, large-scale financial exposure.

### **2. Overall Cap on Liability (Further Buyer Protection)**
   - **Section 8.3** imposes a **monetary cap** on total liability (except for indemnification claims).  
   - The exact cap is redacted ([***]), but if negotiated favorably, this ensures the buyer’s maximum exposure is **predictable and limited**.  

### **Why This is Buyer-Favorable**
- **Reduces Risk for Buyer**: The buyer is shielded from open-ended liability for consequential damages (which can be substantial in business disputes).  
- **Exceptions Favor Buyer**: The carve-outs (indemnity, confidentiality, liquidated damages) are typically areas where the buyer has more control or negotiated protections.  
- **Clear Limitations**: The clause prevents ambiguity by explicitly excluding certain damages, reducing litigation risk.  

### **Potential Buyer Considerations**
- If the buyer wants **even stronger protection**, they might:  
  - Push for a **lower liability cap** in **Section 8.3**.  
  - Ensure **indemnification obligations** (Section 7.2) are well-defined to avoid loopholes.  
  - Confirm that **liquidated damages** (Section 10.5.2) are reasonable and not excessive.  

### **Conclusion**
This clause is **buyer-favorable** because it:  
✔ **Eliminates liability for consequential damages** (protecting the buyer from large, unpredictable losses).  
✔ **Caps total liability** (providing financial certainty).  
✔ **Carves out only narrow exceptions** (keeping most risk with the seller).  

If the buyer wants further protection, they could negotiate a **lower cap** or **tighter indemnity terms**, but as written, this clause already leans in their favor.",5

Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Cap on Liability**:  
   - The clause imposes a **USD 13 million cap** on liability for both buyer and seller for breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants.  
   - This cap would typically include **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits, consequential damages) unless carved out elsewhere in the agreement.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - **Bad faith, intentional/willful misconduct** (protecting both parties equally).  
     - **Third-party claims for personal injury/property damage** (often a non-negotiable carveout).  
   - These exceptions are **neutral**—they don’t favor the buyer or seller specifically.  

3. **Relevance to ""Buyer-Favorable"" Waiver**:  
   - A **buyer-favorable** waiver of indirect damages would typically:  
     - **Exclude the buyer** from liability for indirect damages while **binding the seller**.  
     - Or, **carve out buyer-specific protections** (e.g., allowing the buyer to claim indirect damages for seller breaches but not vice versa).  
   - This clause is **not buyer-favorable** because:  
     - It applies the **same cap and exceptions to both parties**.  
     - It does not explicitly **exempt the buyer from indirect damages** or grant the buyer additional recourse.  

### Suggested Buyer-Friendly Revisions:  
To make the clause more buyer-favorable, you could:  
1. **Exclude buyer liability for indirect damages entirely** while retaining seller liability.  
   *Example*:  
   *""Notwithstanding the above, Buyer shall not be liable to Seller for any indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising under this Agreement.""*  

2. **Carve out buyer claims from the cap**:  
   *Example*:  
   *""The USD 13 million cap shall not apply to Buyer’s claims for indirect damages resulting from Seller’s breach.""*  

3. **Expand exceptions for buyer benefits**:  
   *Example*:  
   Add exceptions for *""Buyer’s lost profits or business interruption due to Seller’s breach.""*  

### Conclusion:  
The current clause is **neutral**—it limits liability symmetrically and does not specifically advantage the buyer. To align with a **buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages**, the clause would need explicit asymmetrical protections for the buyer.

However, the query specifically asks about a **buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages**, which implies a one-sided limitation where the buyer seeks protection from liability while retaining the right to claim such damages from the seller.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Current Structure (Mutual Waiver):**  
   - The clause is **neutral**, applying equally to both parties. Neither the buyer nor the seller can recover indirect damages from the other.  
   - The exception for third-party indemnity claims (e.g., lawsuits from unaffiliated parties) does not favor either side.  

2. **Buyer-Favorable Modifications Needed:**  
   - To make this clause **buyer-favorable**, it should be revised to:  
     - **Exempt the buyer** from the waiver, allowing the buyer to still claim indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) from the seller.  
     - **Maintain the seller’s waiver**, meaning the seller cannot claim indirect damages from the buyer.  
   - Example revision:  
     *""Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, **Seller** waives all claims for consequential, indirect, or punitive damages against Buyer, but **Buyer retains the right** to pursue such damages against Seller for breaches of this Agreement.""*  

3. **Key Buyer Protections Missing in Current Clause:**  
   - No carve-out for buyer claims (e.g., if seller’s breach causes lost revenue).  
   - No exclusion for seller’s gross negligence/willful misconduct (often negotiated in buyer-friendly terms).  

### **Conclusion:**  
The current clause is **not buyer-favorable** because it imposes a mutual waiver. To align with the query, the clause should be **asymmetrical**, protecting the buyer while restricting the seller’s recourse to indirect damages.

   - However, if the buyer is **less likely to cause indirect damages** (e.g., if the seller’s product failure could cause lost profits for the buyer), the waiver may **disproportionately benefit the seller** by shielding them from larger claims.  

3. **Exceptions to the Waiver**  
   - The clause **excludes** claims under **Section 9 (Representations, Warranties, and Indemnification)**, meaning indirect damages may still be recoverable for breaches of those obligations.  
   - It also **excludes third-party claims for personal injury or property damage**, meaning such claims are not subject to the waiver.  

### **Is This Clause Buyer-Favorable?**  
- **No, unless modified.** As written, this is a **mutual waiver**, not a one-sided buyer protection.  
- To make it **buyer-favorable**, the buyer could:  
  - **Exclude itself** from the waiver (e.g., ""Seller waives all indirect damages, but Buyer retains the right to claim them"").  
  - **Narrow the scope** of waived damages (e.g., allowing lost profits in cases of seller’s gross negligence).  
  - **Increase the direct damages cap** (currently $15M) to compensate for the lack of indirect damages.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **neutral** in its treatment of indirect damages. If the buyer wants a **favorable waiver**, it would need to negotiate a **one-sided or conditional exclusion** allowing it to recover indirect damages while restricting the seller’s ability to do so.
