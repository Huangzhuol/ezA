New York Governing Law,92b8288812,"The laws of the State of New York (excluding any laws that direct the application of another jurisdiction's law) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.","The clause you provided is directly responsive to the query about **""New York Governing Law""** in a contract. Here’s how it aligns with the query and why it is relevant:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Governing Law**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that **New York law** (excluding conflict-of-law rules) governs all matters related to the agreement, including:  
     - Validity, interpretation, and construction of the contract.  
     - Performance and enforcement of obligations.  
     - Disputes arising from the agreement or its contemplated transactions.  

2. **Exclusion of Conflict-of-Law Rules**:  
   - The clause excludes any New York laws that might otherwise apply another jurisdiction’s laws (e.g., via renvoi or choice-of-law principles). This ensures **exclusive reliance on New York substantive law**.  

3. **Comprehensive Scope**:  
   - It covers not just the agreement itself but also **all transactions contemplated by the agreement**, leaving no ambiguity about the breadth of New York law’s application.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The query seeks clarity on how New York law governs a contract. This clause provides a **clear, unambiguous statement** that New York law applies to all aspects of the agreement, which is critical for:  
  - **Predictability**: Parties know which jurisdiction’s laws will interpret the contract.  
  - **Enforcement**: Courts or arbitrators will apply New York law to resolve disputes.  
  - **Avoiding Conflicts**: By excluding other jurisdictions’ laws, it minimizes legal uncertainty.  

### Contrast with External Information:  
The external examples discuss **Delaware** as the jurisdiction for enforcement (e.g., Court of Chancery) and equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions). However, your clause focuses solely on **New York as the governing law**, not jurisdiction. This distinction is important because:  
- **Governing Law** = Which state’s laws apply to interpret the contract.  
- **Jurisdiction** = Which courts have authority to hear disputes.  
Your clause does not address jurisdiction (unlike the external examples), but it ensures New York law governs even if enforcement occurs elsewhere.  

### Practical Implications:  
- Parties often pair a **New York governing law clause** with a **separate forum selection clause** (e.g., specifying New York courts or federal courts for disputes).  
- New York is a preferred choice for commercial contracts due to its well-developed contract law and predictability.  

In summary, this clause **definitively answers the query** by establishing New York as the governing law for all contractual matters, excluding any competing laws from other jurisdictions.",5
New York Governing Law,149cfa46e3,"Any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including to its execution, performance or enforcement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws thereof.","The clause you provided is directly responsive to the query about **""New York Governing Law""** in a contract. Here’s how it aligns with the query and its relevance:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Governing Law**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the agreement (including disputes over execution, performance, or enforcement) will be governed by **New York law**, irrespective of conflict-of-law principles that might otherwise apply.  
   - This ensures predictability and consistency in legal interpretation, as New York law is well-developed for commercial contracts.

2. **Scope of Application**:  
   - It covers **all disputes** related to the agreement, including breach, enforcement, and performance. This broad scope avoids ambiguity about which law applies in litigation or arbitration.

3. **Conflict-of-Law Exclusion**:  
   - The clause overrides default conflict-of-law rules that might apply (e.g., if another jurisdiction has a ""closer connection"" to the dispute). New York law applies exclusively.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The query seeks clarity on how New York law governs the contract. This clause provides a definitive answer by:  
  - Designating New York as the **exclusive legal framework** for disputes.  
  - Rejecting alternative conflict-of-law analyses that might pull in other jurisdictions' laws.  

### Contrast with External Information:
The external excerpts discuss **Delaware** as the forum for enforcement (e.g., Delaware Court of Chancery) and equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions). However, your clause focuses on **substantive law** (New York) rather than procedural/jurisdictional rules. The two can coexist:  
- **Substantive Law**: New York law governs contract interpretation.  
- **Procedural Law/Forum**: A separate clause (like those in the external examples) could designate Delaware courts for litigation.  

### Practical Implications:
- **New York’s commercial law** is often chosen for its clarity and precedent in business disputes.  
- Parties can still agree to litigate in another forum (e.g., Delaware) while applying New York law.  

In summary, your clause is a **standard and enforceable choice-of-law provision** that directly addresses the query by mandating New York law for all aspects of the agreement.",5
New York Governing Law,a75e169141,"This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York.","The clause **""This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York""** is directly responsive to the query about **""New York Governing Law""** because it explicitly designates New York law as the applicable legal framework for interpreting and enforcing the contract. Here’s why this is relevant:

1. **Choice of Law**: The clause confirms that any disputes or legal issues arising from the agreement will be resolved under New York state law, including its statutes, common law, and judicial precedents. This avoids conflicts over which jurisdiction’s laws apply.

2. **Interpretation**: It ensures consistency in how the contract’s terms are construed, as New York courts (or other courts applying New York law) will use established state-specific principles to interpret ambiguous provisions.

3. **Contrast with Jurisdiction Clauses**: While the external information provided discusses **exclusive jurisdiction** (e.g., Delaware courts or federal courts for enforcement), the governing law clause is distinct. For example:
   - The external excerpts focus on *where* disputes are litigated (jurisdiction) and remedies like injunctions. 
   - The New York clause focuses on *which laws* govern, regardless of the forum. A contract could specify New York law but allow litigation in Delaware (though this may raise complexities).

4. **Practical Implications**: New York law is often chosen for its well-developed commercial legal framework. Parties might prefer it even if jurisdiction is elsewhere (as seen in the external examples, where Delaware courts enforce agreements potentially governed by another state’s law).

**Key Takeaway**: The clause answers the query by unequivocally selecting New York law as the contractual ""rulebook,"" while jurisdiction clauses (like those in the external texts) determine the physical forum for disputes. Both are critical but address different aspects of legal enforceability.",5
New York Governing Law,f3887246bf,"The laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.","The clause you provided is directly responsive to the query about **""New York Governing Law""** in a contract. Here’s how it aligns with the query and why it is relevant:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Governing Law**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that **New York law** (excluding its conflicts of law rules) governs all matters related to the agreement, including:  
     - Validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.  
     - Any disputes arising from the agreement or the transactions it contemplates.  

2. **Scope**:  
   - It covers **all aspects** of the agreement, ensuring consistency in legal interpretation and enforcement under New York law.  
   - The exclusion of conflicts of law principles prevents courts from applying the laws of another jurisdiction, even if a dispute has connections to other states or countries.  

3. **Comparison with External Information**:  
   - The external examples (e.g., Delaware jurisdiction in *maud_417* and *maud_102*) highlight how governing law clauses often pair with **jurisdiction/venue provisions** (e.g., specifying courts in a particular state).  
   - While your clause focuses on **choice of law** (New York), the external examples emphasize **enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctions in Delaware courts). These are complementary but distinct concepts.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause answers the query by clearly designating **New York law** as the controlling legal framework for the agreement.  
- It avoids ambiguity by rejecting conflicts of law principles, ensuring New York law applies uniformly.  
- Unlike the external examples (which focus on Delaware courts for enforcement), this clause does not address jurisdiction—only the substantive law.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Predictability**: Parties can rely on New York’s well-developed contract law precedents.  
- **Neutrality**: New York is a common choice for commercial contracts due to its neutrality and expertise in complex transactions.  
- **Enforcement**: While the clause does not specify courts, New York law would guide any litigation or arbitration, even if filed elsewhere (unless the agreement also includes a jurisdiction/venue clause).  

Would you like help drafting a companion clause for jurisdiction/venue to align with this governing law provision?",5
New York Governing Law,843fbeb743,"This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to conflict of laws principles. Both parties submit to personal jurisdiction in New York and further agree that any cause of action arising under this Agreement shall be brought in a court in New York City, NY.","The clause provided directly addresses the **""New York Governing Law""** query by specifying that the agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, excluding conflict of laws principles. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Governing Law**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that New York law will apply to the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement. This ensures consistency and predictability in legal disputes, as New York courts are well-versed in commercial matters.  
   - The exclusion of conflict of laws principles prevents the application of another jurisdiction’s laws, even if a dispute has connections to other states or countries.

2. **Jurisdiction and Venue**:  
   - The clause mandates that both parties submit to **personal jurisdiction** in New York and requires any disputes to be brought in **New York City courts**. This aligns with the query by designating New York as the exclusive forum for litigation, avoiding jurisdictional disputes.  

### Comparison to External Information:  
While the external examples focus on **Delaware** (common for corporate matters) and emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions), the provided clause is narrower:  
- It does not address equitable relief (like specific performance) but could implicitly allow for it under New York law.  
- Unlike the Delaware examples, it does not explicitly waive bond requirements for injunctions or reference federal courts.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause is a standard **New York choice-of-law and forum selection provision**, ensuring disputes are resolved under New York law in New York courts. It is simpler than the Delaware-centric examples but serves a similar purpose of legal certainty.  

Would you like to incorporate elements from the external examples (e.g., equitable remedies) into this clause?",5
England Governing Law,7511a4e3af,This agreement shall be governed by the Laws of England (English common and statutory Law).,"The clause **""This agreement shall be governed by the Laws of England (English common and statutory Law)""** is directly responsive to the query about **""England Governing Law""** because it explicitly designates the legal system that will interpret, enforce, and apply to the contract. Here’s why it is relevant:

1. **Choice of Law**:  
   - The clause specifies that English law (both common law and statutes) will govern the agreement. This means any disputes or interpretations of the contract will be resolved according to English legal principles, regardless of where the parties are based or where disputes arise.

2. **Contrast with External Information**:  
   - The external references discuss **Delaware law** and jurisdiction (e.g., Delaware Court of Chancery or federal courts in Delaware), which are irrelevant to this clause. The query focuses on **England**, and the clause clearly diverges from the Delaware-centric examples provided.

3. **Implications for Dispute Resolution**:  
   - While the external clauses emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** in Delaware courts, the England governing law clause does not address jurisdiction or enforcement procedures. It solely establishes the substantive legal framework (English law).  
   - If the parties wanted to align with the external examples, they would need additional clauses specifying English courts (e.g., the High Court of England and Wales) for jurisdiction and enforcement, similar to the Delaware-focused provisions.

4. **Practical Effect**:  
   - Under English law, remedies like injunctions or specific performance (mentioned in the external texts) would still be available, but their application would follow English legal standards and procedures. The clause ensures predictability by anchoring the contract to a well-defined legal system.

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause answers the query by definitively selecting **English law** as the governing law, but it does not address jurisdiction or enforcement mechanics (unlike the Delaware examples). If those details are needed, supplemental clauses would be required.",5
England Governing Law,7e61b9aeb0,This Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales.,"The clause **""This Agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales.""** directly addresses the **""England Governing Law""** query by specifying that the contractual relationship between the parties is subject to the legal framework of **England and Wales**. Here’s why this is relevant:

1. **Choice of Law**:  
   - The clause explicitly designates **English law** as the governing law for interpreting the agreement, resolving disputes, and determining the rights/obligations of the parties. This avoids conflicts over which jurisdiction’s laws apply.  

2. **Contrast with External Examples**:  
   - The external references (e.g., Delaware courts, U.S. federal law) highlight how governing law clauses vary by jurisdiction. Your clause diverges by selecting England/Wales instead of U.S. states like Delaware.  
   - Unlike the external examples, which emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) in Delaware courts, your clause implies that English courts (or arbitral tribunals, if specified elsewhere) would handle such enforcement.  

3. **Legal Implications**:  
   - English contract law principles (e.g., precedent, statutory interpretation under the **Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999**) will govern.  
   - Dispute resolution (e.g., litigation or arbitration) would typically occur in England unless another clause specifies venue.  

4. **Practical Relevance**:  
   - Ensures predictability for parties familiar with English legal traditions.  
   - May interact with other clauses (e.g., jurisdiction, arbitration) to create a cohesive dispute resolution framework.  

**Key Takeaway**: The clause is a straightforward declaration that English law controls the agreement, distinguishing it from other jurisdictional frameworks (like Delaware in the external examples). Additional clauses would address enforcement mechanisms (e.g., courts or arbitration).",5
England Governing Law,fdf90f378b,This Amendment and and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England.,"The clause you provided explicitly states that the **governing law** for the amendment (and any disputes or claims related to it) will be the **laws of England**. This directly addresses the query about **England Governing Law** by specifying that:  

1. **Applicable Law** – The agreement (and any disputes arising from it) will be interpreted and enforced under **English law**, not the laws of any other jurisdiction.  
2. **Scope** – It covers not just contractual disputes but also **non-contractual claims** (e.g., tort or statutory claims).  
3. **Formation & Subject Matter** – Even disputes about how the agreement was formed (e.g., validity, interpretation) fall under English law.  

### **Relevance to External Information**  
While the external references discuss **Delaware law** and **equitable remedies** (like injunctions), your clause is distinct because:  
- It does **not** specify an **exclusive jurisdiction** (unlike the Delaware examples, which mandate litigation in Delaware courts).  
- It focuses solely on **choice of law** (England), not where disputes must be resolved.  

### **Key Implications**  
- If a dispute arises, English legal principles (e.g., contract interpretation, remedies) will apply.  
- Parties could still litigate in another country’s courts, but those courts would apply **English law** to the dispute.  
- Unlike the Delaware examples, this clause does **not** prevent parties from seeking injunctions or equitable relief—it just ensures such claims are assessed under English legal standards.  

Would you like help drafting a complementary **jurisdiction clause** (e.g., specifying English courts as exclusive forum)?",5
England Governing Law,3cab4c15d9,"This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales, and all actions brought hereunder whether at law or in equity shall be brought in England.","The clause you provided specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of England and Wales and that any legal actions (whether at law or in equity) arising from the agreement must be brought in England. This directly addresses the query about ""England Governing Law"" by establishing:  

1. **Governing Law**: The agreement will be interpreted and enforced according to the laws of England and Wales, meaning English legal principles will apply to disputes, contractual obligations, and remedies.  

2. **Jurisdiction**: All legal proceedings must be initiated in England, ensuring a centralized forum for dispute resolution. This prevents parties from filing lawsuits in other jurisdictions, providing predictability and consistency.  

### Relevance to External Information:  
While the external excerpts discuss Delaware law and jurisdiction (focusing on equitable remedies like injunctions and specific performance), your clause serves a similar purpose but for England:  
- Like the Delaware provisions, it ensures disputes are resolved under a specific legal framework (English law).  
- It mandates exclusive jurisdiction in England, similar to how the external clauses designate Delaware courts (or federal courts in Delaware).  
- However, unlike the Delaware examples, your clause does not explicitly detail equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions), though English courts inherently have such powers under their legal system.  

### Key Difference:  
The external clauses emphasize *enforcement mechanisms* (e.g., injunctions for breaches), while your clause is broader, covering both governing law and jurisdiction. To align more closely with the external examples, you might add explicit language about equitable relief (e.g., ""Parties may seek injunctive relief in English courts to enforce obligations"").  

In summary, your clause answers the query by defining England as the legal and jurisdictional anchor for the agreement, though it omits procedural details found in the Delaware-centric examples.",5
England Governing Law,6a8b24fc6b,This Agreement is governed by English law.,"The clause **""This Agreement is governed by English law""** is directly responsive to the query about **""England Governing Law""** because it explicitly specifies that the agreement is subject to the laws of England. Here’s why this is relevant:

1. **Choice of Law**: The clause designates English law as the legal framework for interpreting, enforcing, and resolving disputes arising under the agreement. This means that English statutory and common law principles will apply to the contract, regardless of where the parties are based or where disputes might arise.

2. **Contrast with External Examples**:  
   - The external references (e.g., Delaware law and courts in the provided excerpts) highlight how governing law clauses typically pair with jurisdictional provisions (e.g., specifying courts in Delaware). However, the queried clause is simpler and focuses solely on the applicable law (England) without addressing jurisdiction or enforcement mechanisms.  
   - Unlike the external examples, which detail remedies like injunctive relief in specific courts (e.g., Delaware Court of Chancery), the clause here is concise and leaves procedural enforcement matters to general English legal principles unless supplemented elsewhere in the agreement.

3. **Implications**:  
   - Under English law, parties retain flexibility to seek remedies (e.g., damages, specific performance) as permitted under English contract law, unless the agreement includes additional clauses (like those in the external examples) that narrow or specify enforcement mechanisms.  
   - If the agreement lacks jurisdiction/exclusive forum clauses (unlike the Delaware examples), English courts may still assert jurisdiction based on the governing law clause, but other courts could also have authority depending on conflict-of-law rules.

**Key Takeaway**: The clause answers the query by confirming English law as the governing law, but its brevity suggests that other sections of the agreement (or default legal rules) would address enforcement specifics, unlike the more detailed external examples provided.",5
Clause with multiple governing laws,05ef7e7d77,"This Agreement and any and all matters arising directly or indirectly herefrom shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the [***] applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely in such state, including its statutes of limitation but without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.","The query concerns a **clause with multiple governing laws**, and the provided clause specifies a single governing law framework for the agreement. Here’s how it relates to the query and the external context:

### **Relevance to the Query**  
1. **Single Governing Law**:  
   The clause explicitly states that the agreement is governed by the internal laws of a specific state (redacted as `[***]`), **excluding conflict-of-law principles**. This creates a unified legal framework for interpretation, enforcement, and disputes, avoiding ambiguity from multiple jurisdictions.  

2. **Indirect Connection to Multiple Laws**:  
   While the clause itself designates one state’s laws, the phrase *""matters arising directly or indirectly herefrom""* could implicate other jurisdictions in practice (e.g., if a dispute involves cross-border performance or parties). However, the clause **rejects conflict-of-law rules**, reinforcing the chosen state’s laws as the sole reference.  

3. **Link to External Context**:  
   The external examples (e.g., *Maud_417* and *Maud_102*) highlight clauses addressing **enforcement** and **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) in specific courts (e.g., Delaware Chancery Court). Though those clauses focus on jurisdiction and remedies, they align with the governing law clause’s purpose: ensuring predictability by centralizing legal standards and dispute resolution.  

### **Key Implications**  
- **Consistency**: The clause avoids conflicts by mandating one state’s laws, even if ancillary issues (e.g., merger obligations) might involve other jurisdictions.  
- **Enforcement**: Like the external examples, it supports specific performance (e.g., injunctions) by clarifying the legal basis for enforcement.  
- **Limitation**: By excluding conflict-of-law principles, it prevents courts from applying foreign laws to override the chosen state’s rules.  

### **Why This Matters for ""Multiple Governing Laws""**  
If the query seeks to address scenarios where multiple laws could apply (e.g., cross-border contracts), this clause **mitigates complexity** by designating a single governing law. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where different provisions of the agreement might require distinct legal frameworks (e.g., IP laws vs. contract laws). For true ""multiple governing laws,"" a more nuanced approach (e.g., split clauses per subject matter) would be needed.  

**Conclusion**: This clause is relevant as it resolves potential multiplicity of laws by imposing a single governing law, aligning with the external examples’ emphasis on enforceability and jurisdictional clarity.",5
Clause with multiple governing laws,92b8288812,"The laws of the State of New York (excluding any laws that direct the application of another jurisdiction's law) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.","The query concerns a **clause with multiple governing laws**, and the provided clause explicitly designates **New York law** as the sole governing law for all matters related to the agreement, including validity, interpretation, enforcement, etc. Here’s how this clause is relevant to the query:

1. **Single Governing Law**:  
   The clause clearly states that **only New York law** applies, excluding any conflict-of-law rules that might otherwise refer to another jurisdiction’s laws. This avoids ambiguity or potential conflicts between multiple governing laws.

2. **Contrast with External Examples**:  
   The external references (e.g., *Maud_417* and *Maud_102*) discuss **jurisdiction** (e.g., Delaware courts) and **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) but do not explicitly address governing law. The provided clause, however, focuses solely on **choice of law**, not jurisdiction or enforcement procedures.  

3. **Relevance to Query**:  
   - If the query is about a clause that **combines governing law and jurisdiction**, this example does not do that—it is strictly a **choice-of-law clause**.  
   - If the query is about **avoiding multiple governing laws**, this clause achieves that by explicitly excluding any laws that might apply another jurisdiction’s rules.  

4. **Potential Interaction with Jurisdiction Clauses**:  
   While this clause governs substantive law, it does not address **which courts** have jurisdiction (unlike the external examples, which specify Delaware courts). A contract might pair this with a separate **forum selection clause** (e.g., ""All disputes shall be resolved in New York courts"").  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause is **not an example of multiple governing laws** but rather a **clear, singular choice-of-law provision**. If the query seeks a clause that blends or conflicts with multiple legal systems, this would not fit. However, if the goal is to see how a contract avoids multiple governing laws, this clause demonstrates that by explicitly selecting New York law and rejecting any conflict-of-law rules.  

Would you like me to draft a clause that *does* incorporate multiple governing laws (e.g., for different sections of an agreement)?",5
Clause with multiple governing laws,135342ef61,"This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its principles regarding conflicts of law. This Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to its conflicts of laws principles or the conflicts of laws principles of any other jurisdiction, and each of the parties hereto expressly attorns to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York.","The query relates to a clause that specifies **multiple governing laws** within the same contractual provision. Here’s how the provided clause is relevant to the query:

### Key Observations:
1. **Dual References to Governing Law**:  
   - The clause states twice that the Warrant/Agreement is governed by New York law:  
     - First: *""governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York""*.  
     - Second: *""construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York""*.  
   - While both statements align (both designate New York law), the repetition could create ambiguity or redundancy, which might necessitate clarification in drafting.

2. **Conflict of Laws Principles**:  
   - Both iterations explicitly **reject** the application of New York’s conflict of laws principles (and those of other jurisdictions). This ensures predictability by avoiding potential conflicts with foreign laws.  

3. **Jurisdictional Attornment**:  
   - The clause includes an **express attornment** to New York courts, reinforcing the parties’ intent to submit to New York’s jurisdiction. This aligns with the external examples (e.g., Delaware courts in *maud_417*), where exclusive jurisdiction is specified for enforcement.  

### Relevance to External Examples:  
- The external clauses (e.g., *maud_417* and *maud_102*) emphasize **specific performance** and **exclusive jurisdiction** (e.g., Delaware courts). While the Warrant clause focuses on New York, it similarly aims to:  
  - Provide legal certainty by designating a single governing law.  
  - Preempt conflicts of laws issues.  
  - Establish a clear forum for disputes (New York courts).  

### Potential Issue:  
- Unlike the external examples, the Warrant clause does not address **irreparable harm** or **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions). If the Warrant involves high-stakes obligations (like mergers), adding such provisions (as seen in *maud_102*) could strengthen enforceability.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause is relevant to the query because it demonstrates a **redundant but consistent** approach to governing law and jurisdiction, with a clear rejection of conflicts principles. However, it could be refined by:  
1. Eliminating repetitive language.  
2. Incorporating equitable relief terms (if applicable) for breaches, as seen in the external examples.  

Would you like suggestions for redrafting to streamline or enhance enforceability?",5
Clause with multiple governing laws,f3887246bf,"The laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all of the transactions it contemplates, including without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement.","The clause you provided establishes a **single governing law** (New York law) for all matters related to the agreement, including its validity, interpretation, and enforcement. However, the **query asks about clauses with *multiple* governing laws**, which suggests a scenario where different laws might apply to different aspects of the agreement (e.g., substantive law vs. procedural law, or distinct jurisdictions for enforcement).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Contrast with Multiple Governing Laws**:  
   - Your clause is a straightforward example of a **unified choice-of-law provision**, applying New York law comprehensively.  
   - The query likely seeks clauses where, for example:  
     - One jurisdiction’s law governs interpretation, while another governs enforcement.  
     - A default law is specified, but exceptions exist for certain provisions (e.g., Delaware law for equitable remedies).  

2. **Connection to External Examples**:  
   - The provided external clauses (e.g., *Maud_417*) highlight **exclusive jurisdiction** in Delaware courts for enforcement (e.g., injunctions), even if another law governs the agreement. This creates a *de facto* multiplicity:  
     - New York law might govern interpretation, but Delaware courts handle enforcement.  
     - Such clauses often pair a general governing law (like your NY clause) with a separate jurisdictional rule for disputes.  

3. **Key Takeaway**:  
   - Your clause is **not an example of multiple governing laws** but illustrates how a single-law clause might interact with jurisdictional provisions (like those in the external examples) to create layered legal frameworks.  

If the query aims to draft or analyze a clause with *multiple* governing laws, your clause could serve as a baseline, with modifications to split applicability (e.g., “New York law governs interpretation, but Delaware law governs equitable remedies”). Would you like help drafting such a bifurcated clause?",4
Clause with multiple governing laws,29d5d669bf,"THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED ACCORDING TO AND GOVERNED BY THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, EXCLUDING ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD LEAD TO THE APPLICATION OF A SUBSTANTIVE LAW OTHER THAN THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.","The clause you provided is a **Governing Law** clause, which specifies that the agreement and the parties' rights and obligations under it will be interpreted and governed by **Delaware substantive law**, excluding Delaware's conflict-of-law principles to the extent they would lead to applying another jurisdiction's laws.  

### **Relevance to the Query on ""Clause with Multiple Governing Laws""**  
While your clause does **not** explicitly mention multiple governing laws, it does address a scenario where conflicts of law could arise by:  
1. **Explicitly rejecting conflicts-of-law principles** that might otherwise apply a different jurisdiction's law.  
2. **Ensuring uniformity** by mandating that **only Delaware substantive law** governs the agreement, even if another jurisdiction's law might otherwise apply under general conflict-of-law rules.  

### **Connection to External References**  
The external references (e.g., *Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction* and *Section 8.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction*) discuss:  
- **Enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctive relief in Delaware courts).  
- **Jurisdictional exclusivity** (e.g., disputes must be resolved in Delaware state or federal courts).  

Your clause complements these by ensuring that **Delaware law** (not another state's law) will apply to interpret the agreement, reinforcing the parties' intent to centralize legal disputes under Delaware law and jurisdiction.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
Your clause is **not** a true ""multiple governing laws"" clause (where different laws apply to different sections), but it **preemptively resolves potential conflicts** by mandating Delaware law exclusively. This aligns with the enforcement and jurisdiction clauses in the external references, creating a cohesive legal framework centered on Delaware law and courts.

Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks,6dd55572fe,This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflict or choice of law principles.,"The clause you provided specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, **excluding** the application of conflict of law or choice of law principles. This is directly relevant to the query about ""Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks"" because:

1. **Exclusion of UCC or Uniform Laws**:  
   - By stating that the agreement is governed solely by California law (without reference to conflicts/choice of law rules), the clause implicitly excludes the application of the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)** or other uniform laws (e.g., Uniform Arbitration Act) unless California’s version of those laws expressly incorporates them.  
   - The UCC is a regulatory framework that typically applies to transactions involving goods, negotiable instruments, or secured transactions. By limiting governance to California law, the parties avoid potential overlaps or conflicts with the UCC’s default rules (unless California’s statutes adopt them).  

2. **Relevance to External References**:  
   - The external examples (e.g., Delaware Chancery Court enforcement) highlight clauses where parties agree to specific legal forums and remedies (e.g., injunctive relief). Your clause similarly narrows the legal framework but focuses on **substantive law** (California) rather than procedural/jurisdictional rules.  
   - Unlike the external examples, your clause does not address enforcement mechanisms but ensures predictability by avoiding conflicts with other states’ laws or federal frameworks like the UCC.  

3. **Key Implication**:  
   - The clause ensures that only California’s **non-UCC statutory and common law** (e.g., contract interpretation, equity principles) applies, unless the UCC is expressly adopted by California in a relevant context (e.g., sales of goods under Cal. Com. Code).  

**Drafting Note**: If the intent is to **explicitly** exclude the UCC, consider adding:  
*""This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of law principles and the Uniform Commercial Code.""*

Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks,c2714a9a64,"This Agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions enforced in accordance with, the laws of California without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.","The query asks about a **governing law clause that excludes the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or other similar regulatory frameworks**. The provided clause states:

> *""This Agreement shall be governed by, and its provisions enforced in accordance with, the laws of California without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.""*

### Relevance to the Query:
1. **Exclusion of UCC/Regulatory Frameworks**  
   - The clause specifies that California law governs the agreement **without reference to conflicts of laws principles**.  
   - While it does not explicitly exclude the UCC, California’s commercial code (which incorporates the UCC) would generally apply to transactions involving goods unless the parties expressly opt out.  
   - If the parties intend to **exclude the UCC**, they should explicitly state:  
     *""This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of California, excluding its Uniform Commercial Code and any other similar regulatory frameworks.""*  

2. **Comparison with External References**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., *Maud_417* and *Maud_102*) focus on **jurisdiction and equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) but do not address UCC exclusion.  
   - The given clause is more general and does not explicitly limit statutory frameworks like the UCC, unlike what the query seeks.  

3. **Key Takeaway**  
   - The clause is **partially relevant** but insufficient for a strict exclusion of the UCC or similar laws.  
   - To fully align with the query, it should be **revised to expressly disclaim** the UCC or other regulatory schemes if that is the intent.  

### Suggested Revision for Explicit Exclusion:  
*""This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, excluding its conflict of laws principles, the Uniform Commercial Code, and any other similar regulatory frameworks.""*

Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks,27eaf01d0a,"THE INTERPRETATION AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS CONTRACT SHALL BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND CONTROLLED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DOCTRINES GOVERNING CHOICE OF LAW.","The clause you provided specifies that the contract will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, **excluding the application of choice-of-law doctrines**. This is directly relevant to your query about **excluding the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or other similar regulatory frameworks** because:

1. **Exclusion of UCC by Implication**  
   - The UCC is a standardized set of business laws adopted (with some variations) by U.S. states, including Texas.  
   - By stating that Texas law governs **""without regard to the doctrines governing choice of law,""** the clause emphasizes that only Texas's **substantive** laws (not conflicts-of-law principles) apply.  
   - If the parties intended to **exclude the UCC**, they would typically do so explicitly (e.g., ""excluding the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in Texas""). However, the absence of such language means the UCC may still apply **unless it conflicts with the contract’s express terms**.  

2. **Relevance to the External Examples**  
   - The provided external clauses focus on **jurisdiction, equitable remedies, and enforcement** (e.g., Delaware Chancery Court, specific performance).  
   - Your clause, by contrast, is purely a **choice-of-law provision** and does not address dispute resolution forums or remedies.  
   - If the parties wanted to **further exclude the UCC or other frameworks** (e.g., CISG for international contracts), they would need explicit language, such as:  
     *""This Agreement shall be governed by Texas law, excluding (i) the Uniform Commercial Code and (ii) any conflicts-of-law principles that might apply the law of another jurisdiction.""*  

3. **Practical Effect**  
   - Without an express UCC exclusion, Texas’s version of the UCC could still govern aspects like sales of goods (UCC Article 2) or negotiable instruments (UCC Article 3), unless the contract terms override them.  
   - The clause **does not exclude statutory or regulatory frameworks** (e.g., securities laws, antitrust laws) that might apply independently.  

### Suggested Revision for Explicit UCC Exclusion:  
If the intent is to **fully exclude the UCC and similar frameworks**, consider:  
> *""This Agreement shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of Texas, excluding (a) its conflict-of-law rules, (b) the Uniform Commercial Code, and (c) any other uniform or model laws that might otherwise apply.""*

In order to operate your Franchised Business under this Agreement, we hereby license use of such data back to you, at no additional cost, solely for the term of this Agreement and for your use in connection with operating the Franchised Business.","The **Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks** query seeks to understand how the clause operates independently of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or analogous regulatory regimes. Here’s how the provided clause is relevant:

### **1. Non-Exclusive Licensing and Proprietary Rights**  
The clause (Sections 9.3.6.1–9.3.6.3) establishes a **non-exclusive licensing framework** for Proprietary Marks, allowing the licensor to:  
- Use the marks themselves,  
- Grant additional licenses to third parties, and  
- Develop competing systems under similar marks.  

**Relevance to Governing Law:**  
- The UCC (Article 2) governs sales of goods and may apply to certain licensing agreements if they involve tangible goods. However, this clause focuses on **intellectual property (trademarks, franchise systems, and proprietary methods)**, which are typically governed by **contract law, trademark law, and common law principles** rather than the UCC.  
- By explicitly defining the scope of rights (e.g., perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide), the parties avoid default UCC rules (e.g., implied warranties or merchantability under § 2-314) that might otherwise apply to goods-related transactions.  

### **2. Perpetual Rights and No Payment Obligations**  
Section 9.4 grants the franchisor a **perpetual, non-exclusive right** to use franchisee-submitted ideas/methods without compensation.  

**Relevance to Governing Law:**  
- The UCC does not govern **uncompensated IP assignments** or **perpetual licensing**—these are contractual matters under state common law or statutory IP law.  
- The clause ensures enforceability **independent of UCC doctrines** (e.g., consideration requirements under contract law may still apply, but UCC gap-fillers like § 2-204 would not).  

### **3. Exclusion of Implied UCC Terms**  
The clause **explicitly defines rights** (e.g., no payment for ideas, no franchisee rights to derivative marks), negating UCC-implied terms (e.g., good faith under § 1-304) that might otherwise create unintended obligations.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is structured to **avoid UCC applicability** by:  
- Focusing on **IP licensing** (not goods),  
- Defining rights **exhaustively** (leaving no gaps for UCC default rules), and  
- Relying on **general contract law** (or specific IP statutes) for enforcement.  

Thus, it aligns with the query’s intent to **exclude UCC or similar frameworks** in favor of tailored contractual terms.

Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks,80d287bc4a,"Without reference to choice or conflict of law principles, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA.","The clause you provided specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, **without reference to choice or conflict of law principles**. This directly addresses the query regarding **""Governing Law excluding UCC or other similar regulatory frameworks""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Exclusion of the UCC and Other Uniform Laws**  
   - The **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)** is a standardized set of laws governing commercial transactions, adopted (with variations) by U.S. states.  
   - By stating that the agreement is governed **solely by California law** (and not referencing conflicts of law principles), the clause ensures that **only California’s general contract law applies**, not necessarily the UCC or other uniform laws (unless California’s version of the UCC is inherently part of its general contract law).  
   - If the parties intend to **exclude the UCC explicitly**, they might further clarify (e.g., ""excluding the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in California"").  

### 2. **Rejection of Conflict of Law Principles**  
   - The phrase **""without reference to choice or conflict of law principles""** prevents courts from applying another jurisdiction’s laws (e.g., if a dispute arises in a state other than California).  
   - This reinforces that **only California’s substantive law** (not other states’ or federal law, unless mandatory) governs the agreement.  

### 3. **Comparison to External Clauses**  
   - The external examples (e.g., Delaware jurisdiction clauses) focus on **enforcement** (injunctions, specific performance) but do not explicitly exclude the UCC.  
   - Your clause is **broader** in limiting the governing law strictly to California’s statutes and common law, potentially sidelining the UCC unless California’s UCC is directly applicable.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause ensures that **California law controls**, minimizing the influence of external frameworks like the UCC or other states’ laws. If the intent is to **explicitly exclude the UCC**, additional language (e.g., ""excluding the Uniform Commercial Code"") could be added for absolute clarity.

Most Favored Nation Clause,47921871a2,"This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.","The **Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause** is a provision in a contract that ensures one party receives the most favorable terms offered by the other party to any third party. While the provided clause does not explicitly mention an MFN clause, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### 1. **Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**  
   - The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by **California law**, excluding conflicts of laws and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  
   - If an MFN clause were included in the agreement, its interpretation and enforcement would be subject to California law, which could influence how courts assess fairness, discrimination, or breach of the MFN provision.  

### 2. **Enforcement and Remedies (Connection to External Information)**  
   - The external references discuss **specific performance, injunctions, and equitable relief** in case of breaches (e.g., failure to consummate a merger).  
   - If an MFN clause were breached (e.g., one party granted better terms to a third party), the injured party might seek similar remedies (injunctive relief or specific performance) under California law, akin to the Delaware examples provided.  

### 3. **Jurisdictional Implications**  
   - While the clause does not address jurisdiction (unlike the external examples, which designate Delaware courts), an MFN dispute in California would still rely on the state’s legal framework for contract enforcement.  
   - California courts may look to precedents on MFN clauses in commercial contracts, ensuring consistency with the governing law clause.  

### Key Takeaway  
The **governing law clause** indirectly supports the enforceability of an MFN provision by:  
- Defining the legal system that interprets the MFN clause.  
- Aligning with broader principles (like those in the external examples) that allow equitable remedies for contractual breaches, which could include MFN violations.  

For a direct MFN clause analysis, you would need explicit language, but this clause sets the legal foundation for how such a provision would operate.

Most Favored Nation Clause,2eff6f9356,"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.","The **Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause** is a provision in a contract that ensures one party receives the most favorable terms offered to any other party in similar agreements. While the provided clause does not explicitly mention an MFN clause, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### **1. Governing Law and Interpretation**  
The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by **California law**, excluding conflicts of laws and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. This is important for an MFN clause because:  
- **Enforceability**: The validity and interpretation of an MFN clause may depend on California contract law principles.  
- **Consistency**: If an MFN clause exists elsewhere in the agreement, its application must align with California’s legal standards.  

### **2. Conflict with Jurisdiction Clauses in External References**  
The external references (e.g., *Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction*) discuss **Delaware as the exclusive jurisdiction** for disputes, including injunctive relief. If this agreement contains an MFN clause, a conflict could arise if:  
- The MFN clause grants one party more favorable dispute resolution terms (e.g., California vs. Delaware jurisdiction).  
- A court must decide whether California law permits enforcement of an MFN clause that might override jurisdictional preferences.  

### **3. Implications for Remedies**  
The external references emphasize **specific performance and injunctive relief** in Delaware courts. If an MFN clause in this agreement provides for different remedies (e.g., arbitration in California), the governing law clause would determine whether such terms are enforceable.  

### **Conclusion**  
While this clause does not directly address an MFN provision, it sets the legal framework (**California law**) that would govern how an MFN clause is interpreted and enforced. If an MFN clause exists elsewhere in the agreement, this clause ensures that California law—not Delaware or international standards—controls its application.

Most Favored Nation Clause,829065c4f5,"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to its conflict or choice of law rules or principles. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.","The **Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause** is a provision in a contract that ensures one party receives the most favorable terms offered to any other party in similar agreements. While the provided clause does not explicitly mention an MFN clause, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### **Relevance to Most Favored Nation Clause:**
1. **Governing Law & Dispute Resolution:**  
   - The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of **New York** and **California**, excluding conflict of laws rules.  
   - If an MFN clause were included in this agreement, its interpretation and enforcement would be subject to these chosen laws.  
   - Courts in these jurisdictions would determine whether the MFN clause applies and how it interacts with other contractual terms.

2. **Consistency in Legal Interpretation:**  
   - An MFN clause often requires uniform treatment across agreements.  
   - The choice of law (New York/California) ensures that any disputes over the MFN clause’s scope or enforcement would be resolved under a predictable legal framework.  

3. **Exclusion of Conflicting Laws:**  
   - The clause explicitly excludes **conflict of laws principles** and the **UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)**.  
   - This prevents external legal systems from overriding the agreed-upon terms, which could be crucial if the MFN clause is challenged.  

### **Connection to External Information:**
The external references discuss **specific performance** and **injunctive relief** in case of breaches (e.g., failure to consummate a merger). If an MFN clause were breached, similar equitable remedies (like injunctions) could apply under the governing law specified in the clause.  

### **Conclusion:**  
While the clause itself does not contain an MFN provision, its **choice of law and exclusion of conflicting rules** ensures that any MFN clause in the agreement would be interpreted and enforced consistently under **New York or California law**, without interference from external legal systems. This provides legal certainty—a key consideration when drafting or enforcing an MFN clause.

Most Favored Nation Clause,665e0ae8f1,"The Parties agree that the venue for any action, injunctive application or dispute determinable by a court of law arising out of this Agreement and that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, without giving effect to choice of law or arbitration provisions, and that the federal and state courts therein shall have jurisdiction over the subject matter and the Parties.","The **Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause** typically ensures that a party receives the best available terms offered to any other party in similar agreements. While your provided clause does not explicitly mention an MFN provision, it is relevant to the query in the context of **enforcement mechanisms and jurisdictional preferences**, which are often critical in MFN clauses to ensure equitable treatment.

### Relevance to MFN Clauses:
1. **Jurisdictional Certainty & Enforcement**  
   - The clause specifies that disputes will be resolved in **North Carolina courts** under **North Carolina law**, excluding arbitration or choice-of-law conflicts.  
   - In an MFN context, this ensures that all parties are subject to the same legal standards and enforcement mechanisms, preventing one party from gaining an advantage by litigating in a more favorable jurisdiction.  

2. **Injunctive Relief & Specific Performance**  
   - The external references (e.g., *Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction*) highlight that parties may seek **injunctions or specific performance** to enforce contractual obligations.  
   - If an MFN clause requires equal treatment, this enforcement mechanism ensures no party can circumvent obligations by breaching the agreement, preserving parity.  

3. **Consistency in Legal Remedies**  
   - The clause aligns with the external examples by emphasizing **exclusive jurisdiction** and **waiver of bond requirements** for injunctive relief.  
   - For an MFN clause, uniform remedies (like injunctions) prevent one party from leveraging disparate legal systems to undermine agreed terms.  

### Key Takeaway:  
While not an MFN clause itself, this provision supports MFN principles by:  
- Establishing a **neutral, consistent legal framework** for disputes.  
- Ensuring **enforceability of equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions), which are critical to maintaining parity under MFN terms.  

If the MFN clause in question requires uniform dispute resolution or enforcement, this jurisdictional clause would be a foundational component to uphold those obligations.

This Agreement is governed by, and will be construed in accordance with, the laws of British Columbia, Canada.","The **Most Favored Nation (MFN) Clause** typically ensures that a party receives treatment no less favorable than that given to other parties in similar agreements. While the provided clause does not explicitly mention an MFN provision, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### **1. Governing Law and Jurisdiction Implications for MFN Clauses**  
- The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by **British Columbia law** and that disputes will be resolved in **British Columbia courts**.  
- If an MFN clause exists elsewhere in the agreement, this jurisdictional clause could impact how disputes related to the MFN provision are adjudicated.  
- Courts in British Columbia would interpret the MFN clause (if present) under **B.C. contract law principles**, which may differ from other jurisdictions (e.g., Delaware in the external examples).  

### **2. Comparison with External Examples (Delaware Jurisdiction Clauses)**  
- The external examples emphasize **exclusive jurisdiction in Delaware courts** (including equitable remedies like injunctions).  
- In contrast, the given clause provides **non-exclusive jurisdiction** in British Columbia, meaning parties could potentially litigate elsewhere unless restricted.  
- If an MFN clause requires uniform enforcement (e.g., ensuring no party gets better dispute resolution terms), the **choice of jurisdiction and governing law** could affect its application.  

### **3. Potential Relevance to MFN Enforcement**  
- If an MFN clause requires that no party receives more favorable **dispute resolution terms**, the **non-exclusive jurisdiction** here could be scrutinized.  
- For example, if another party in a related agreement has **exclusive jurisdiction** (like in the Delaware examples), the MFN clause might require alignment to prevent discrepancies.  

### **Conclusion**  
While the clause itself does not contain an MFN provision, its **governing law and jurisdiction terms** could influence how an MFN clause (if present elsewhere in the agreement) is interpreted and enforced. The **non-exclusive jurisdiction** aspect may be particularly relevant if the MFN clause seeks to ensure uniform dispute resolution mechanisms across agreements.

Renewal clause that requires notice to Renew,ee70d57af2,"This Agreement will automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a ""Renewal Term""), unless either Party notifies the other at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable, of its intention not to renew this Agreement (a ""Termination Notice"").","The clause you provided is directly responsive to the query about a **renewal clause that requires notice to renew**. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

1. **Automatic Renewal**:  
   The clause states that the agreement will **automatically renew** at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term (on a year-to-year basis) unless action is taken to prevent renewal. This establishes the default renewal mechanism.

2. **Notice Requirement for Non-Renewal**:  
   To stop the automatic renewal, either party must provide a **Termination Notice** at least **30 days before** the end of the current term. This satisfies the query’s requirement for a clause that mandates advance notice to avoid renewal.

3. **Clarity on Timing and Procedure**:  
   The clause specifies:  
   - **When notice must be given** (30 days prior to term expiration).  
   - **What constitutes valid notice** (a formal ""Termination Notice"").  
   - **Applicability to all terms** (Initial Term and any Renewal Term).  

### Relevance to External Information:  
While the external references discuss **termination clauses** (e.g., post-termination obligations or fees), they do not address renewal mechanisms. Your clause fills this gap by explicitly governing **renewal** and the **notice requirement to opt out**, making it distinct from termination-related provisions.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause ensures continuity of the agreement unless a party proactively declines renewal by adhering to the notice requirement, which is precisely what the query seeks.",5
Renewal clause that requires notice to Renew,30aebe87b8,"This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the <omitted> Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about a **renewal clause that requires notice to renew**. Here's how:

1. **Automatic Renewal with Notice Requirement**:  
   The clause states that the agreement will automatically renew for additional one-month periods **unless** either party (Customer or i-on) provides notice of non-renewal. This creates a **notice-based renewal mechanism**—the agreement continues unless affirmative action (notice) is taken to stop it.

2. **Notice Timing**:  
   The clause specifies that notice must be given **at least 15 days before** the end of the current term (initial or renewal). This ensures both parties have clarity on whether the agreement will continue and time to plan accordingly.

3. **Contrast with External Information**:  
   The external examples discuss termination fees and post-termination restrictions (e.g., prohibitions on alternative acquisitions within 12 months). These are unrelated to renewal clauses. Your clause, however, focuses purely on the **procedural requirement for renewal**—highlighting the importance of notice to prevent automatic extension.

### Key Relevance:  
The clause exemplifies a **common renewal structure** where continuation is conditional on the absence of notice. It answers the query by showing how parties can contractually mandate advance notice to avoid unintended renewals.

Here's how:

1. **Automatic Renewal**: The clause states that the agreement will automatically renew for additional one-month periods unless either party (Customer or i-on) provides notice of non-renewal. This means the agreement continues without explicit action unless a party opts out.

2. **Notice Requirement**: To prevent automatic renewal, a party must give notice of its intention **not to renew** at least **15 days before the end of the current term** (initial or renewal). This ensures clarity and avoids unintended renewals.

3. **Comparison to External Information**:  
   - The external examples discuss termination clauses (e.g., post-termination obligations or fees), but your clause focuses on **renewal mechanics**.  
   - Unlike termination clauses, which often involve penalties or conditions after ending an agreement, your renewal clause is proactive—it ensures parties actively decide whether to continue the agreement.

### Key Relevance:  
The clause satisfies the query by detailing:  
- **How renewal works** (automatically unless notice is given).  
- **The notice requirement** (timing and method to stop renewal).  

This is distinct from termination clauses (like those in the external examples), which deal with ending an agreement rather than continuing it.

1. **Automatic Renewal with Notice Requirement**:  
   The clause states that the agreement will renew automatically for successive 3-year terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least **90 days before the end of the current term** (Initial Term or Renewal Term). This aligns with the query by explicitly requiring advance notice to prevent renewal.

2. **Condition for Non-Renewal**:  
   The clause specifies that renewal is the default outcome unless affirmative action (written notice) is taken to stop it. This creates a clear procedural requirement for termination via non-renewal, which is the focus of the query.

3. **Link to Termination Provisions**:  
   The clause also references termination rights under **Article 11**, which may include other grounds for ending the agreement (e.g., breach, mutual consent). This distinguishes non-renewal (which requires notice) from other termination mechanisms.

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts discuss termination (e.g., Article IX in *maud_680*), your clause focuses on **renewal** and its conditions. The external context highlights termination procedures, but your clause complements such provisions by addressing how the agreement continues unless actively terminated via notice.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause satisfies the query by detailing:  
- **Automatic renewal** unless notice is given.  
- **Timing requirement** (90 days’ notice).  
- **Distinction** between non-renewal and other termination methods.

1. **Automatic Renewal**:  
   - The agreement will renew for successive terms (each a **""Renewal Term""**) unless terminated under **Section 25** or if a party provides a **written notice of non-renewal**.  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on renewal conditioned on notice.

2. **Notice Requirement**:  
   - To avoid automatic renewal, either party must give **written notice of non-renewal** at least **[***] (a specified period)** before the end of the current term.  
   - This satisfies the query’s requirement for a clause that **mandates notice to renew (or not renew)**.

3. **Termination Exception**:  
   - The clause carves out an exception if the agreement is terminated under **Section 25**, which may involve other termination triggers (e.g., breach, mutual agreement).  
   - This adds nuance, showing renewal is secondary to termination rights.

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts don’t directly address renewal, they highlight contractual mechanics like:  
- **Written consent requirements** (e.g., ""prior written consent"" in *maud_854*), reinforcing the importance of formal notice.  
- **Termination triggers and timelines** (e.g., *maud_392*), which parallel the structure of the renewal clause (e.g., deadlines for actions).  

### Why It Answers the Query:  
The clause is a **clear example of a renewal provision** where:  
- Renewal is **automatic unless** a party acts (via notice).  
- The **notice period** is specified, ensuring predictability.  
- It distinguishes between **renewal** and **termination**, addressing potential overlaps.  

This matches the query’s need for a clause where renewal hinges on notice (or lack thereof).",5
Clause that requires notice to terminate auto-renew,ee70d57af2,"This Agreement will automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal term on a year to year basis (each, a ""Renewal Term""), unless either Party notifies the other at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal Term, as applicable, of its intention not to renew this Agreement (a ""Termination Notice"").","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about a **""notice requirement to terminate auto-renewal""** in a contract. Here's how it addresses the query:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **Auto-Renewal Mechanism**:  
   The agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms (""Renewal Terms"") unless action is taken to stop it. This creates an ongoing contractual relationship unless terminated.

2. **Notice Requirement for Termination**:  
   To prevent auto-renewal, either party must provide a **Termination Notice** to the other party **at least 30 days before** the end of the current term (Initial Term or Renewal Term). This establishes a clear procedural requirement to terminate the auto-renewal.

3. **Timing and Formality**:  
   The clause specifies:  
   - **When notice must be given** (30 days prior to term expiration).  
   - **How notice is effective** (by formal ""Termination Notice"").  
   - **What the notice accomplishes** (prevents renewal for the next term).

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause explicitly answers the query by outlining the **notice obligation** to terminate auto-renewal. Without such notice, the contract continues indefinitely.  
- It contrasts with the ""External Information"" examples (which discuss termination fees or post-termination effects) by focusing **solely on the procedural step** needed to stop renewal.  
- The 30-day notice period ensures both parties have advance warning to negotiate or transition, reducing disputes over unintended renewals.

### Why This Clause Stands Out:
While the external examples describe complex termination scenarios (e.g., fees, acquisition proposals), your clause is a **straightforward, preventive measure** for auto-renewal. It prioritizes clarity and mutual agreement, avoiding ambiguity about how to end the contractual relationship. 

**In summary:** This clause is a direct response to the query, providing a clear, actionable rule for terminating auto-renewal with proper notice.",5
Clause that requires notice to terminate auto-renew,30aebe87b8,"This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the <omitted> Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about a **""notice requirement to terminate auto-renewal""** in a contract. Here's why:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **Auto-Renewal Mechanism**:  
   The agreement states that it will **automatically renew** for successive one-month periods unless terminated by either party. This creates a continuous contractual relationship unless affirmative action is taken to stop it.

2. **Notice Requirement for Termination**:  
   To prevent auto-renewal, either party (Customer or i-on) must provide **advance notice** of their intent not to renew. The notice must be given:  
   - **At least 15 days** before the end of the current term (initial or renewal period).  
   - This ensures both parties have clarity on whether the agreement will continue or expire.

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   The clause explicitly addresses the **conditions under which auto-renewal can be stopped**:  
   - **Who can act**: Either party.  
   - **How to act**: By providing written notice.  
   - **Timing**: Strict deadline (15 days prior to term end).  

### Comparison to External Information:  
While the external examples discuss termination fees and post-termination restrictions (e.g., 12-month waiting periods for alternative deals), your clause focuses on **procedural requirements to halt auto-renewal**. It is more narrowly tailored to the query, as it:  
- Specifies the **notice period** (15 days).  
- Clarifies that **non-renewal is the outcome** of proper notice.  
- Avoids complex conditions (e.g., fees or penalties) seen in the external examples.  

### Why This Matters:  
This clause ensures **predictability** for both parties by:  
- Preventing unintended renewals (via the notice requirement).  
- Allowing either side to exit the agreement cleanly if they comply with the timeline.  

In summary, your clause is a **clear, standalone provision** governing auto-renewal termination, distinct from the broader termination scenarios in the external examples. It directly answers the query by outlining the notice obligation and its timing.",5
Clause that requires notice to terminate auto-renew,8463d5d208,"This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the<omitted>Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about a **""notice requirement to terminate auto-renewal""** in a contract. Here's why:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **Auto-Renewal Mechanism**:  
   The agreement automatically renews for successive one-month periods unless terminated by either party. This creates a continuous contract unless action is taken.

2. **Notice Requirement for Termination**:  
   To prevent auto-renewal, either party (Customer or i-on) must provide advance notice to the other party of their intent **not to renew**.  
   - **Timing of Notice**: The notice must be given **at least 15 days before** the end of the current term (initial or renewal).  

3. **Purpose**:  
   This ensures both parties have clarity on whether the agreement will continue and avoids unintended renewals due to inaction. It aligns with the query’s focus on **terminating auto-renewal through notice**.

### Comparison to External Information:  
While the external examples discuss termination fees (e.g., Section 7.3) or post-termination effects (e.g., Article IX), your clause is more narrowly focused on **procedural requirements to stop auto-renewal**. It does not address fees or consequences post-termination but strictly governs the **process** of opting out of renewal.

### Why It Answers the Query:  
The clause explicitly outlines:  
- **How** to terminate auto-renewal (by giving notice).  
- **When** the notice must be given (15 days prior to term end).  
- **Who** can act (either party).  

This is a clear, standalone provision addressing the need for notice to terminate auto-renewal, distinct from broader termination clauses in the external examples.  

**Key Takeaway**: The clause ensures neither party is bound by unintended renewals by mandating timely communication.",5
Clause that requires notice to terminate auto-renew,38d6b61e69,"This agreement shall terminate:
a. Automatically if any public authority cancels or declines to renew the Agency's license or Certificate of Authority.
b. Immediately if either party gives detailed written notice to the other of alleged gross and willful misconduct, fraud or material misrepresentation.","The provided clause does not directly address the query regarding a **notice requirement to terminate auto-renewal**. However, it does outline termination conditions that may be relevant in a broader contractual context. Here's the relevance:

1. **Termination Conditions vs. Auto-Renewal Notice**:  
   - The clause specifies two termination scenarios (license cancellation and misconduct), but it does not mention **auto-renewal** or any notice requirement to prevent automatic renewal.  
   - The query seeks a clause that explicitly requires notice to terminate an auto-renewing agreement, which is absent here.  

2. **Indirect Relevance**:  
   - If the agreement includes an **auto-renewal provision elsewhere**, this termination clause would govern how the contract ends **after** renewal (e.g., via misconduct or regulatory action).  
   - The requirement for **written notice** in subsection (b) (for misconduct) shows the parties' intent to formalize termination communications, which *could* imply a similar formality for auto-renewal termination (though not stated).  

3. **Gap Identified**:  
   - For the query, a more relevant clause would explicitly state:  
     *""This agreement shall auto-renew for successive [term] periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least [X days] before the renewal date.""*  
   - The external references (e.g., *Article IX* in `maud_680`) suggest termination procedures but do not clarify auto-renewal notice.  

**Conclusion**: This clause is **not directly responsive** to the query but highlights termination mechanics that could coexist with an auto-renewal structure elsewhere in the contract. To fully address the query, a separate auto-renewal notice provision would be needed.

Clause that requires notice to terminate auto-renew,6352d8c837,"This Agreement shall be automatically renewed for successive three (3) year terms thereafter (each a ""Renewal Term"" and together with the Initial Term, the ""Term"") until and unless (i) either Party provides the other Party written notice of non-renewal no later than ninety (90) days prior the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term or (ii) earlier terminated as provided in this ARTICLE 11.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about a **""notice requirement to terminate auto-renewal""** in a contract. Here's why:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **Auto-Renewal Mechanism**:  
   The agreement automatically renews for successive 3-year terms (""Renewal Terms"") unless specific conditions are met. This creates an ongoing contractual relationship unless actively terminated.

2. **Notice Requirement for Non-Renewal**:  
   To prevent auto-renewal, either party must provide **written notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the end of the current term** (Initial Term or any Renewal Term). This is the core of the query—it explicitly outlines the notice obligation to terminate the auto-renewal feature.

3. **Alternative Termination**:  
   The clause also acknowledges that the agreement may be terminated earlier under other provisions in **Article 11**, but this does not negate the notice requirement for non-renewal.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **answers the query directly** by specifying:  
  - **Who must act**: Either party.  
  - **How to act**: Written notice.  
  - **Timing**: At least 90 days before the term ends.  
  - **Effect**: Prevents auto-renewal for the next term.  

- The external information (e.g., termination procedures in Article IX) is less relevant here because your clause is self-contained and focuses solely on **terminating auto-renewal via notice**, not general termination or abandonment.

### Practical Implications:
- Parties must calendar the 90-day deadline to avoid unintended renewals.  
- The clause ensures mutual awareness of continuation/termination, promoting contractual certainty.  

In summary, this clause is a **clear example of a notice provision governing auto-renewal termination**, which is precisely what the query sought.",5
Termination for Convenience,8a8d5a3c28,"Both Parties agree that during the Term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following the termination, both Parties will not (i) solicit, encourage, or take any other action, which is intended, directly or indirectly, to induce any employee to terminate his or her employment with a Party; or (ii) interfere in any manner with the contractual or employment relationship between the Parties and any their employees.","The clause you provided is a **non-solicitation** provision, which restricts both parties from soliciting or interfering with each other's employees during the term of the agreement and for two years after termination. While this clause does not directly address **Termination for Convenience**, it is relevant in the broader context of post-termination obligations.  

### Relevance to **Termination for Convenience**:  
1. **Post-Termination Effects** – Even if one party terminates the agreement for convenience (without cause), this clause ensures that certain restrictions (non-solicitation of employees) remain enforceable after termination.  
2. **Survival of Obligations** – Many contracts specify that certain clauses (like non-solicitation, confidentiality, or indemnification) survive termination. If this clause is intended to survive, it would apply regardless of whether termination was for convenience or cause.  
3. **Consistency with External References** – The external references mention restrictions on actions between signing and termination (e.g., not interfering with employees without consent). Your clause extends similar protections **beyond termination**, reinforcing continuity in business relationships.  

### Key Consideration:  
If the agreement includes a **Termination for Convenience** clause, it should clarify whether provisions like this non-solicitation clause remain binding post-termination. If not explicitly stated, courts may assess enforceability based on reasonableness (duration, scope, and necessity).

Termination for Convenience,431ff9409a,"Upon termination of this Agreement by Customer in whole or in part or upon the termination of any Facility Addendum, in each case, pursuant to Section 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 or 7.6, and on a terminated-Product-by-terminated-Product basis, at Customer's option and pursuant to Customer's instructions, Manufacturer shall provide Customer with sufficient inventory of such terminated Product to ensure business continuity according to then-current terms and pricing (subject to Section 3) until the earlier of: (i) Customer's identification of, and securing of Regulatory Approval for, another supplier of such terminated Product or (ii) unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Facility Addendum as the ""Inventory Tail Period"" for such Product, a time period that reflects Customer's reasonable needs of such Product as mutually agreed upon by the Parties in good faith.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Termination for Convenience Provisions**
   - The clause explicitly addresses termination by the Customer under Sections 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, or 7.6 (which may include termination for convenience, among other grounds). It details the post-termination obligations, such as:
     - **Inventory Provision**: Manufacturer must supply sufficient inventory of terminated Products to ensure business continuity until Customer secures an alternative supplier or for an agreed ""Inventory Tail Period.""
     - **Purchase of Work-in-Progress/Materials**: Customer may purchase WIP or Product Materials within 90 days post-termination.
     - **Disposal of Quarantined Product**: Specifies cost responsibility for disposal (e.g., Manufacturer bears costs if termination is due to its breach or negligence).

### 2. **Post-Termination Support**
   - The clause requires Manufacturer to provide **Technical Support** (e.g., training, troubleshooting) to facilitate the transfer of production to another facility, ensuring a smooth transition. This is typical in termination-for-convenience clauses to mitigate disruption.

### 3. **Facility Disposition (Change of Control/Asset Sale)**
   - If Manufacturer sells or transfers a Facility, Customer has the right to:
     - Terminate the related Facility Addendum **for cause** within 6 months, or
     - Receive **free Technical Support for 2 years** to transfer production.  
   - This protects Customer’s interests if Manufacturer’s actions (e.g., divestiture) indirectly force termination.

### 4. **Assignment of Contracts/Licenses**
   - Upon termination, Manufacturer must assist in assigning material contracts/licenses to Customer if requested (subject to third-party consent). This facilitates continuity for Customer post-termination.

### Comparison to External Examples
   - The external examples focus on **termination fees** tied to acquisition-related terminations (e.g., if a party enters an alternative deal post-termination). Your clause, however, is more operational, addressing:
     - **Inventory/Supply Continuity** (unlike financial penalties in the external examples).
     - **Cooperation Obligations** (e.g., Technical Support, contract assignments), which are absent in the fee-centric external clauses.
   - Both your clause and the external examples, however, include **time-bound triggers** (e.g., 90-day purchase window, 12-month fee liability in external clauses).

### Key Relevance to Query
Your clause exemplifies **termination-for-convenience mechanics** in a supply/manufacturing context, emphasizing:
- **Customer’s flexibility** to exit with minimal disruption.
- **Manufacturer’s obligations** to support transition (inventory, WIP, licenses).
- **Cost allocation** based on termination cause (e.g., breach vs. convenience).

Unlike the external examples (focused on fees for post-termination deals), your clause prioritizes **operational continuity**, which is critical in manufacturing agreements where physical goods and regulatory approvals are involved.

Below is a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Termination Rights & Business Continuity**  
- The clause allows the **Customer** to terminate the agreement (or a Facility Addendum) **at its discretion** under Sections 7.3–7.6 (which likely include termination-for-convenience provisions).  
- Upon termination, the **Manufacturer must supply sufficient inventory** to ensure business continuity until:  
  - Customer secures a new supplier (with Regulatory Approval), **or**  
  - A mutually agreed **""Inventory Tail Period""** expires.  
- This ensures a smooth transition, minimizing disruption to the Customer’s operations.  

### **2. Post-Termination Obligations**  
- **Purchase of Work-in-Process & Materials**:  
  - Customer has **90 days post-termination** to buy any WIP or Product Materials exclusively procured for it.  
  - If termination is due to **Manufacturer’s breach** (e.g., gross negligence), Manufacturer bears disposal costs for quarantined Product.  
- **Technical Support & Transition Assistance**:  
  - Manufacturer must provide **reasonable support** (e.g., training, troubleshooting) to facilitate transfer to a new supplier.  
  - If a **Facility Disposition** occurs, Customer may terminate the related Facility Addendum **for cause** or demand **free technical support** for up to **2 years** to transition production.  

### **3. Assignment of Contracts & Licenses**  
- Upon request, Manufacturer must **assign material contracts/licenses** (where permissible) to Customer within **90 days** of termination, easing the shift to a new supplier.  

### **Comparison to External References**  
While the external examples focus on **termination fees tied to acquisition deals**, this clause instead details **practical post-termination logistics** (inventory, materials, support, and assignments). It reflects a **customer-friendly termination-for-convenience framework**, ensuring minimal operational disruption.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Flexibility for Customer**: Broad termination rights under Sections 7.3–7.6.  
- **Transition Safeguards**: Inventory supply, WIP purchases, and technical support mitigate post-termination risks.  
- **Cost Allocation**: Manufacturer bears costs if termination stems from its breach or Facility Disposition.

Termination for Convenience,0323b9143c,"Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, upon 30 days' prior written notice of such termination; provided, (a) that, with respect to the Services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A, unless otherwise indicated therein, those Services may not be terminated independently except in accordance with an agreed Migration Plan and, (b) any unamortized costs associated with Provider's purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will be passed through to the Terminating Party.","The query relates to **""Termination for Convenience,""** and the provided clause outlines the conditions under which either party (Company or RGHI) can terminate certain services without cause (i.e., for convenience). Here’s how the clause is relevant:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **Termination Rights**  
   - The **Company** can terminate **Transition Services** for convenience.  
   - **RGHI** can terminate **Reverse Transition Services** for convenience.  
   - **30 days' prior written notice** is required unless otherwise agreed or stated in the Exhibits.  

2. **Exceptions & Restrictions**  
   - **Services in Section G1 of Exhibit A** cannot be independently terminated unless an agreed **Migration Plan** is in place.  
   - **Unamortized costs** (e.g., licenses or other expenses incurred specifically for providing the services) must be reimbursed by the **Terminating Party**.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**
- The clause provides a **structured framework** for termination for convenience, ensuring that:  
  - The terminating party gives **proper notice**.  
  - Certain **critical services** (like those in Section G1) are protected from abrupt termination.  
  - The **provider of the services** is compensated for unrecovered costs.  

- The **external information** (from MAUD documents) discusses **termination fees** in the context of acquisition-related terminations, but the clause here is broader, covering **general service terminations** rather than deal-specific scenarios.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause is relevant because it defines **when and how** a party can terminate services for convenience, ensuring fairness and financial accountability. Unlike the external examples (which focus on **acquisition-related termination fees**), this clause governs **ongoing service agreements** with specific notice periods and cost-recovery mechanisms.

Termination for Convenience,494bebe771,"Customer acknowledges that the Termination for Convenience Fee and the Termination for Cause Fee are each a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty. If M&I terminates this Agreement following an Event of Default on the part of Customer, or if Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1 above without complying with the notification requirements set forth in Section 11.1, then Customer shall pay M&I a termination fee (""Termination for Cause Fee"") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value, payable as set forth in Section 11.1 above. Customer may terminate this Agreement during the Term upon at least one (1) years' written notice to M&I, provided that Customer pays M&I an early termination fee (""Termination for Convenience Fee"") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value.","The clause provided is highly relevant to the query about **""Termination for Convenience""** as it explicitly outlines the conditions, obligations, and financial implications associated with terminating an agreement for convenience. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause Related to Termination for Convenience:
1. **Definition of Termination for Convenience**:  
   The clause allows the **Customer** to terminate the agreement during the term **without cause** (i.e., for convenience) by providing at least **one (1) year's written notice** to M&I. This contrasts with termination for cause (e.g., due to an Event of Default).

2. **Termination Fee Structure**:  
   - The Customer must pay a **""Termination for Convenience Fee""**, calculated as a percentage (REDACTED) of the **Estimated Remaining Value** of the agreement.  
   - This fee is framed as **liquidated damages** (a pre-agreed reasonable estimate of damages) rather than a penalty, which aligns with the legal enforceability of such clauses.  

3. **Comparison to External Information**:  
   The external excerpts from Section 7.02 discuss a **Termination Fee** tied to an ""Acquisition Transaction"" within 12 months of termination. While the context differs (M&A vs. general contracts), both clauses:  
   - Impose financial consequences for termination under specific conditions.  
   - Treat the fee as liquidated damages (not a penalty), ensuring enforceability.  
   - Highlight the importance of timing (e.g., 1-year notice in the clause vs. 12-month restriction in the external text).  

4. **Legal Intent**:  
   The clause emphasizes that the fee is a **reasonable approximation of damages** (e.g., lost revenue for M&I due to early termination), which mirrors the rationale in the external examples where fees compensate for broken deals.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- The clause directly answers how **Termination for Convenience** operates in practice:  
  - It requires **advance notice** (1 year) and **payment of a fee**.  
  - It distinguishes between termination for convenience vs. cause, similar to how the external text distinguishes termination scenarios.  
- The **liquidated damages** language mitigates disputes over actual damages, a common feature in termination clauses (as seen in the external examples).  

### Practical Implications:  
- **For the Customer**: Early termination is possible but costly, discouraging arbitrary exits.  
- **For M&I**: The fee compensates for lost expected value, akin to the ""Termination Fee"" in the external M&A context.  

In summary, this clause is a **concrete example** of how contracts structure Termination for Convenience provisions, aligning with broader legal principles (e.g., liquidated damages) seen in other contexts like M&A agreements.",5
Non-compete bound by time and territory,1c8a2e7fbf,"you and your Principal Owners must enter into a non-competition agreement wherein you agree not to engage in a competitive business for a period of two (2) years after the Transfer and within twenty-five (25) miles of your Franchise Premises or any other The Joint Corp.

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, you agree not to engage in a competitive business for a period of two (2) years after the termination or expiration and within twenty-five (25) miles of your Franchise Premises or any other The Joint Corp. Location franchise location.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about a **non-compete bound by time and territory** because it explicitly defines both the **temporal (time) and geographical (territory) restrictions** on competitive activities. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **Time Bound (Temporal Scope)**  
   - The clause imposes a **2-year non-compete period** after two triggering events:  
     - **After the Transfer** (likely a sale or transfer of the franchise).  
     - **After termination/expiration of the Agreement** (regardless of the reason).  
   - This mirrors the external examples (e.g., the 12-month restriction in the ""Company Termination Fees"" provision), though with a longer duration (2 years vs. 12 months).  

### 2. **Territory Bound (Geographical Scope)**  
   - The clause restricts competition within a **25-mile radius** of:  
     - The franchisee’s **Franchise Premises**.  
     - Any other **The Joint Corp. Location franchise**.  
   - This creates a clear territorial boundary, similar to how the external examples define limits (though theirs are tied to transactions rather than physical locations).  

### 3. **Prohibited Activities**  
   - The clause broadly defines competitive activities, including:  
     - Working for a competitor.  
     - Holding ownership or financial interests in a competing business.  
     - Serving in managerial, advisory, or other roles for competitors.  
   - This ensures the non-compete is **enforceable** by specifying what constitutes a violation.  

### **Comparison to External Examples**  
While the external examples focus on **post-termination fees for competing transactions** (e.g., mergers/acquisitions), your clause is a **direct non-compete covenant** with:  
- **Stricter duration** (2 years vs. 12 months).  
- **Explicit geographical limits** (25 miles vs. no territory mentioned in the external examples).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is a **classic non-compete** with clear **time (2 years) and territory (25 miles)** restrictions, making it directly responsive to the query. It goes further than the external examples by detailing prohibited conduct and applying to franchisees, owners, and even family members.

Non-compete bound by time and territory,555c8639d5,"Gulf Oil and Gulf India each agree during the Non-Compete Period not to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of any businesses involved in, or otherwise competing with, the business of the Combined Business from any entity on Schedule 1 hereto. Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending two years after the Closing Date (the ""Non- Compete Period""), it shall not, other than solely through its direct or indirect ownership of Buyer's capital stock or any other interests in Buyer, directly, or indirectly, including through or on behalf of a subsidiary, anywhere in the world, excluding India: (i) own, manage, operate or control any business which competes with any Combined Business or (ii) be or become a shareholder, partner, member or owner of any Person who is engaged in any Combined Business;","The clause provided is highly relevant to the query about a **non-compete bound by time and territory** because it explicitly defines both the temporal (time) and geographic (territory) scope of the non-compete obligations. Here's the breakdown:

### **1. Time Bound (Non-Compete Period)**  
The clause specifies:  
- **Start Date:** Effective Date (typically the date the agreement becomes enforceable).  
- **End Date:** Two years after the Closing Date (the ""Non-Compete Period"").  
- This creates a **fixed duration** (2 years post-closing) during which the restrictions apply.  

### **2. Territory Bound (Geographic Scope)**  
The clause restricts competitive activities:  
- **""Anywhere in the world, excluding India""** → This means the non-compete applies **globally except India**.  
- India is carved out as an exception, likely because the parties (Gulf Oil and Gulf India) have agreed to allow competition there.  

### **3. Prohibited Activities**  
The clause restricts:  
- **Direct or indirect** ownership, management, or control of competing businesses.  
- **Investment or association** with entities engaged in the Combined Business.  

### **Comparison with External References**  
The external references (from MAUD) also discuss restrictions on competitive activities but focus on:  
- **Time-bound restrictions** (between agreement date and termination/Effective Time).  
- **Requiring prior written consent** for certain actions.  

However, the provided clause is **more explicit** in defining:  
- A **fixed 2-year period** (vs. an open-ended ""until termination"").  
- A **global restriction with a carve-out (India)** (vs. no specified territory in the MAUD excerpts).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is a **strong example of a non-compete bound by both time (2 years) and territory (worldwide, excluding India)**. It ensures that Gulf Oil and Gulf India cannot engage in competitive activities for a defined period in specified regions, protecting the Combined Business from unfair competition post-transaction.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Time Bound (Restricted Period)**  
   - The clause restricts the employee's competitive activities **during the Restricted Period**, which is a predefined timeframe (though not explicitly stated in the excerpt, it is typically defined elsewhere in the contract).  
   - For certain provisions (e.g., sub-paragraph 14.2(f)), the restriction applies **indefinitely** (e.g., prohibitions on using the name ""Bicycle"" or similar).  

### 2. **Territory Bound (Restricted Territory)**  
   - The non-compete applies **only within the Restricted Territory**, a defined geographic area where the Company or Group Companies operate.  
   - Sub-sections (a), (b), and (c) explicitly state that the restrictions apply **""in the Restricted Territory""**, ensuring the clause is geographically limited.  

### 3. **Scope of Restricted Activities**  
   - The clause prohibits:  
     - Direct or indirect employment/engagement with a competitor (**14.2(a)**).  
     - Conducting business with Restricted Customers or Prospective Customers (**14.2(b)-(c)**).  
     - Soliciting employees (**14.2(d)**).  
     - Misrepresenting association with the Company post-termination (**14.2(e)**).  
     - Using a confusingly similar business name (**14.2(f)**).  

### 4. **Reasonableness & Enforceability**  
   - The restrictions are tied to **legitimate business interests** (protecting customer relationships, goodwill, and workforce stability).  
   - The geographic and temporal limitations help ensure the clause is **reasonable and enforceable** under common law principles (e.g., not overly broad).  

### Comparison with External Information  
   - The external references (e.g., MAUD clauses) discuss **temporary restrictions during a merger process**, while this clause is a **post-employment non-compete**. However, both:  
     - Are bound by **time** (Restricted Period vs. ""until Effective Time"").  
     - Define **prohibited activities** (e.g., solicitation, competition).  
     - Include **territorial limits** (Restricted Territory vs. no explicit mention in MAUD).  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause is a **classic non-compete** with clear **time and territory bounds**, ensuring it balances the Company’s protection with the employee’s right to work post-termination. Its enforceability hinges on the reasonableness of the **duration, geographic scope, and activities restricted**.

If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query about **""Non-compete bound by time and territory""** in the following ways:  

### **1. Territorial Restriction (Geographic Scope)**  
The clause specifies that Hydraspin will offer the Distributor the **first opportunity** to become the **exclusive distributor** for any **new territory in the United States**. This implies a territorial restriction where the Distributor has a **right of first refusal** within a defined geographic area (the U.S.), which is a common feature in non-compete and exclusivity agreements.  

### **2. Time-Bound Obligation**  
The clause imposes a **10-business-day window** for the Parties to negotiate exclusivity terms. If no agreement is reached within this period, Hydraspin is no longer obligated to contract with the Distributor for that territory. This creates a **time-bound condition** similar to non-compete clauses that limit activities for a specific duration.  

### **3. Exclusivity & Non-Compete Implications**  
While not a traditional non-compete clause, this provision functions similarly by:  
- **Restricting Hydraspin** from freely contracting with other distributors in the new U.S. territory before offering the opportunity to the existing Distributor.  
- **Limiting the Distributor’s competitive rights** if they fail to secure the exclusivity agreement within the allotted time.  

### **Comparison with External References**  
The external references discuss **termination fees** and **superior proposal obligations**, which are more about deal protections than non-competes. However, they share a conceptual similarity in that they impose **time-sensitive restrictions** (e.g., 2-business-day notice periods, 12-month termination fee triggers).  

### **Conclusion**  
Your clause is **relevant to non-compete principles** because it:  
- Defines a **territorial scope** (U.S. expansion rights).  
- Imposes a **time limit** (10-day negotiation window).  
- Creates an **exclusivity condition** that restricts competitive actions.

### **1. Territorial Restriction (Geographic Scope)**  
- The clause specifies that **Hydraspin will offer the Distributor the ""first opportunity"" to become the exclusive distributor** for any **new territory in the United States**.  
- This implies a **territorial limitation**, as Hydraspin is bound to give the Distributor priority in a defined geographic area (the U.S.) before engaging with other distributors.  
- If Hydraspin does not reach an exclusivity agreement with the Distributor within **10 business days**, it is free to engage with others, reinforcing that the territorial restriction is **time-bound**.

### **2. Time-Bound Restriction (Exclusivity Window)**  
- The clause imposes a **10-business-day window** for negotiations on exclusivity.  
- If no agreement is reached within this period, Hydraspin is **no longer obligated** to contract with the Distributor for that territory.  
- This creates a **temporal limitation** on the Distributor’s right of first refusal, functioning similarly to a **non-compete duration clause**.

### **Comparison with External References**  
- The external references discuss **termination clauses** (e.g., entering a competing agreement within **12 months** of termination) and **notice periods** (e.g., **2 business days** for amendments).  
- Similarly, your clause imposes a **strict deadline (10 business days)** for exclusivity negotiations, acting as a **time-bound restriction** on the Distributor’s rights.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is a **hybrid of territorial and temporal restrictions**, functioning as a **soft non-compete**:  
- **Territory:** U.S. market (new territories).  
- **Time:** 10-business-day negotiation window before Hydraspin can seek other distributors.  

This aligns with the query by demonstrating how contractual obligations can be **bound by both time and territory**, similar to traditional non-compete clauses but framed as a **right of first refusal** instead of an outright prohibition.

Exclusivity bound by time and territory,05ef7e7d77,"This Agreement and any and all matters arising directly or indirectly herefrom shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the [***] applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely in such state, including its statutes of limitation but without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.","The query concerns **""Exclusivity bound by time and territory,""** which typically refers to contractual restrictions limiting a party's ability to operate, compete, or engage in certain activities within a specific geographic area or time period. The provided clause, while not explicitly addressing exclusivity, is highly relevant to such provisions because it establishes the **governing law and enforcement framework** for the agreement, which directly impacts how exclusivity obligations (if any) would be interpreted and enforced. Here’s how:

### Key Relevance to Exclusivity:
1. **Governing Law**  
   - The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by the laws of a particular state (redacted as `[***]`). This is critical for exclusivity terms because:  
     - The enforceability of territorial or time-bound restrictions (e.g., non-compete clauses) depends on the chosen jurisdiction’s laws. Some states (like California) heavily restrict non-compete agreements, while others (like Delaware) may enforce them more broadly.  
     - Statutes of limitation (explicitly referenced in the clause) determine how long a party has to bring a claim for breach of exclusivity obligations.  

2. **Enforcement Mechanism**  
   - The clause mandates that the agreement be **construed and enforced** under the chosen state’s laws. This ties to the external information provided, which emphasizes:  
     - **Specific performance** and **injunctive relief** (e.g., court orders to stop breaches) as remedies for violations (e.g., breaching territorial exclusivity).  
     - The parties’ waiver of bond requirements for injunctions, streamlining enforcement.  

3. **Conflict of Law Exclusion**  
   - By excluding conflict of law principles, the clause ensures that **only the chosen state’s laws** apply, avoiding unpredictable outcomes if another jurisdiction’s laws might invalidate exclusivity terms.  

### Practical Implications for Exclusivity:
- If exclusivity is breached (e.g., a party operates in a prohibited territory or time), the aggrieved party can seek injunctions or specific performance **in the designated state’s courts** (or federal courts, per the external snippets).  
- The clause’s focus on **internal laws** (not international or other state laws) provides predictability for exclusivity disputes.  

### Connection to External Information:
The external snippets highlight Delaware’s role in enforcing merger-related obligations (like exclusivity) through equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions). While the clause does not name Delaware, its structure mirrors the enforcement logic in the external texts, ensuring exclusivity terms are actionable under the chosen jurisdiction’s laws.  

### Conclusion:
This clause is a **foundational pillar** for exclusivity provisions because it:  
1. Dictates which state’s laws govern the scope and validity of exclusivity.  
2. Ensures breaches can be swiftly remedied (via injunctions or specific performance).  
3. Prevents jurisdictional conflicts that might weaken exclusivity protections.  

For a full exclusivity analysis, you’d need to review the agreement’s substantive exclusivity terms (e.g., non-compete clauses), but this clause ensures those terms are enforceable under a predictable legal framework.",5
Exclusivity bound by time and territory,8424ab4201,"This Agreement and all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any breach hereof are governed by and construed under the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law principles that would require the application of the Laws of a different state.","The query concerns **""Exclusivity bound by time and territory,""** which typically refers to contractual provisions limiting a party's rights or obligations to a specific duration (time) and geographic scope (territory). While the provided clause does not directly address exclusivity, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### 1. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**  
The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by **New York law** and that disputes will be resolved under New York law. This indirectly affects exclusivity in two ways:  
   - **Territorial Implication**: By designating New York law, the parties agree that any legal interpretation or enforcement of exclusivity provisions (if present elsewhere in the contract) will be determined by New York courts or arbitral tribunals. This creates a ""legal territory"" for dispute resolution.  
   - **Choice of Law**: The exclusion of other states' laws ensures consistency in how exclusivity clauses (e.g., non-compete or territorial restrictions) are interpreted, as New York law will apply uniformly.  

### 2. **Enforcement of Exclusivity Provisions**  
The external references (e.g., *Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction*) highlight that parties often seek **injunctive relief** to enforce exclusivity obligations (e.g., preventing breaches of non-compete clauses). The governing law clause ensures that New York courts (or federal courts in New York, if applicable) would handle such disputes, which may influence:  
   - The **standard for granting injunctions** (e.g., New York's approach to irreparable harm in exclusivity cases).  
   - The **validity of time/territory restrictions** (e.g., New York’s reasonableness test for non-compete clauses).  

### 3. **Link to External Context**  
The external excerpts emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches. If the agreement includes exclusivity terms (e.g., a party being barred from operating in a region for a set time), this clause ensures that New York courts would adjudicate whether such terms are enforceable under New York law.  

### Key Takeaway  
While the clause itself does not create exclusivity, it **establishes the legal framework** (New York law) for interpreting and enforcing any exclusivity terms elsewhere in the contract. This is critical for disputes over:  
- Whether a territorial or time-bound restriction is valid.  
- Whether a breach of exclusivity warrants injunctive relief.

Exclusivity bound by time and territory,ea85d96226,"This Agreement and all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or any breach hereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.","The query concerns **""Exclusivity bound by time and territory,""** which typically refers to contractual restrictions limiting a party's ability to operate (e.g., compete, sell, or provide services) within a specific geographic area or time period. While the provided clause does not directly address exclusivity, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### 1. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**  
The clause specifies that the agreement is governed by **New York law** and that disputes will be resolved under New York law, excluding conflicts of law principles. This is critical for exclusivity provisions because:  
- **Enforceability**: New York courts (or arbitral tribunals applying New York law) will determine whether exclusivity clauses (e.g., non-compete or territorial restrictions) are valid under New York law.  
- **Predictability**: Parties can rely on New York's legal precedents regarding the reasonableness of time/territory restrictions in exclusivity clauses (e.g., whether a 5-year global non-compete is enforceable).  

### 2. **Dispute Resolution for Breach of Exclusivity**  
If a party violates an exclusivity provision (e.g., by operating in a prohibited territory or time), the clause ensures that:  
- **Forum Selection**: Disputes will be resolved under New York law, which may influence remedies (e.g., injunctive relief, as highlighted in the external information).  
- **Alignment with External Clauses**: The external excerpts emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches. New York courts are experienced in granting such relief for exclusivity breaches if the terms are reasonable.  

### 3. **Indirect Support for Exclusivity Enforcement**  
While not explicit, the clause indirectly supports exclusivity by:  
- **Deterring Breaches**: A clear legal framework discourages parties from violating territorial/time-bound exclusivity.  
- **Harmonizing with Remedies**: The external clauses stress specific performance/injunctions for breaches—tools often used to enforce exclusivity.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause does not create exclusivity but establishes the legal framework for enforcing it. For a complete analysis, the actual exclusivity terms (e.g., duration, geographic scope) and their interplay with New York law would need review.

Exclusivity bound by time and territory,b3497945c4,"[***], neither Valeant nor its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, [***] in the Territory other than the Product; provided that if the Agreement is terminated by Dova pursuant to [***], then any Tail Period shall be immediately terminated if either Valeant or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, [***] in the Territory other than the Product during such Tail Period.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **""Exclusivity bound by time and territory""** because it establishes exclusivity obligations for Valeant and its Affiliates, with specific limitations on **time** and **territory**. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **Exclusivity Bound by Time**  
   - The clause restricts Valeant and its Affiliates from engaging in certain activities **until a specified event occurs** (likely tied to the Agreement's termination or a defined ""Tail Period"").  
   - The **Tail Period** is a post-termination timeframe where exclusivity may still apply, but it can be **immediately terminated** if Valeant or its Affiliates violate the exclusivity terms.  
   - This is similar to the external examples where restrictions apply until the **""Effective Time""** or **termination of the Agreement** (e.g., *""between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and valid termination""* in `maud_65`).  

### 2. **Exclusivity Bound by Territory**  
   - The clause explicitly references **""the Territory""**, meaning the exclusivity obligation is geographically limited.  
   - Valeant and its Affiliates are prohibited from certain activities **only within the defined Territory**, unless an exception (like the Product) applies.  
   - This mirrors the territorial restrictions seen in other agreements (e.g., *""in the Territory other than the Product""*).  

### 3. **Conditional Exclusivity & Termination**  
   - The clause includes a **condition** where exclusivity can be voided if Valeant or its Affiliates act outside the permitted scope (e.g., engaging in prohibited activities in the Territory during the Tail Period).  
   - This resembles the external examples where actions require **prior written consent** (e.g., *""without the prior written consent of Parent""* in `maud_65`).  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- The clause enforces **temporal exclusivity** (limited by Agreement duration + Tail Period) and **geographic exclusivity** (limited to the Territory).  
- It includes **termination triggers** (similar to `maud_65` and `maud_484`) that can void exclusivity if violated.  
- The structure aligns with standard exclusivity clauses in M&A and licensing agreements, where restrictions are tied to both **time** and **territory**.

### Relevance of the Provided Clause to the Query:  
The clause you provided is a **governing law and jurisdiction clause**, which specifies that:  
1. **Israeli law governs** the agreement and any disputes (including enforcement).  
2. It **excludes conflict-of-law rules** that might apply foreign laws.  

While this clause does not directly address exclusivity by time/territory, it is **indirectly relevant** because:  
- **Enforcement of Exclusivity**: If the agreement includes exclusivity terms (e.g., a party is barred from operating in a region for a set time), disputes about breaches would be resolved under Israeli law and courts.  
- **Territorial Scope**: The clause implicitly defines the legal ""territory"" for enforcement (Israel), which could interact with exclusivity terms (e.g., if exclusivity is tied to Israeli jurisdiction).  
- **Remedies**: Like the external examples (which mention injunctions for breaches), Israeli law would determine available remedies (e.g., injunctions to enforce exclusivity).  

### Key Connection:  
The clause ensures that any exclusivity obligations (if present elsewhere in the contract) are interpreted and enforced under Israeli law, creating a predictable legal framework for territorial/time-bound restrictions. For example:  
- If Party A violates an exclusivity clause by operating in a forbidden territory, Party B would sue in Israeli courts under Israeli law.  
- The clause prevents a party from avoiding exclusivity obligations by arguing that another jurisdiction’s laws should apply.  

### Suggested Enhancement:  
To fully address ""exclusivity bound by time and territory,"" the agreement should also include:  
1. **Explicit exclusivity terms** (e.g., ""Party X shall not compete in Region Y for Z years"").  
2. **Remedies for breach** (e.g., injunctive relief, as seen in the external examples).

### **1. Similarity in Purpose (Restrictive Covenant)**  
Both the clause and the external examples (from the provided information) involve **restrictive covenants** that limit certain business activities to protect a party’s interests.  
- The **external examples** (e.g., *Section 5.3 No Solicitation* and *Section 6.3 No Solicitation by the Company*) restrict solicitation of **acquisition proposals** (i.e., preventing third parties from interfering with a pending deal).  
- **Your clause** restricts solicitation and hiring of **employees** (i.e., preventing poaching of talent between SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings).  

While the focus differs (customers vs. employees), the **legal structure** is similar:  
- A **defined restricted period** (e.g., *""during the term of this Agreement and for 12 months thereafter""*).  
- **Exceptions** (e.g., *general solicitations not specifically targeting the other party*).  

### **2. Key Differences**  
- **Scope of Restriction**:  
  - Your clause: **Employee non-solicit** (preventing recruitment).  
  - External examples: **Business non-solicit** (preventing competitive deals).  
- **Parties Bound**:  
  - Your clause: **Mutual restriction** (both SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings are bound).  
  - External examples: **One-sided restriction** (the Company is restricted from soliciting third-party deals).  

### **3. Relevance to ""No-Solicit of Customers""**  
If the query is about drafting or interpreting a **no-solicitation clause for customers**, your clause provides a **template structure** that could be adapted:  
- **Timeframe**: Similar to *""during the term + 12 months after""*.  
- **Exceptions**: Like *general advertising not targeting specific customers*.  
- **Enforceability**: Courts often scrutinize such clauses for reasonableness (as seen in the external examples, which include carve-outs).  

### **Conclusion**  
Your clause is **not directly about customers**, but it shares **structural similarities** with no-solicit clauses in M&A agreements (e.g., defined periods, exceptions). If drafting a **customer non-solicit**, you could use this as a model but adjust the scope to cover **client relationships** instead of employees.

No-Solicit of Customers,77df66b5ca,"Each Party agrees that, during the [***] ([***]) [***] period starting from the Effective Date, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates or otherwise induce or attempt to induce such employees to terminate their employment with such other Party or such other Party's Affiliates; provided, however, that general public solicitations and advertisements not directed at employees of the other Party, and the extension of offers to persons who respond to such general solicitations and advertisements, will not be deemed violations of this provision.","The clause you provided is a **No-Solicit of Employees** provision, which restricts a party from soliciting or hiring employees of the other party for a specified period after the **Effective Date**. While your query is about **No-Solicit of Customers**, the two concepts are related in that they both impose restrictions on competitive behavior between the parties post-agreement.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Similar Restrictive Covenants** – Both clauses (No-Solicit of Customers and No-Solicit of Employees) are designed to protect a party’s business interests by preventing the other party from poaching key resources (customers or employees).  
2. **Temporal Limitation** – The clause you provided specifies a fixed period (redacted as `[***]`) during which solicitation is prohibited, similar to how the external reference (Section 6.3) restricts solicitation until the **Effective Time** or termination of the agreement.  
3. **Indirect vs. Direct Solicitation** – Both clauses prohibit **direct and indirect** solicitation (e.g., through third parties or general inducement).  
4. **Exceptions** – The clause allows **general public solicitations** (e.g., job postings not targeting the other party’s employees), just as the external reference permits certain exceptions (e.g., confidentiality agreements under Section 6.3(b)).  

### **Key Difference:**  
- Your clause focuses on **employee solicitation**, whereas the external reference (Section 6.3) pertains to **acquisition-related solicitation** (preventing the company from seeking competing buyout offers).  

### **Conclusion:**  
While not identical, the **No-Solicit of Employees** clause aligns with the broader theme of restrictive covenants seen in the **No-Solicit of Customers** context. Both serve to prevent unfair competitive practices during and after the agreement’s term. If you need a **No-Solicit of Customers** clause, it would similarly restrict a party from actively targeting the other party’s clients for business, often with comparable exceptions (e.g., general marketing not directed at specific customers).

No-Solicit of Customers,0b81bda9eb,"Consultant will not, during the Term, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, directly or indirectly:<omitted>(ii) solicit, participate in or promote the solicitation of any of the Company's clients, customers, or prospective customers with whom Consultant had a Material Contact (hereinafter defined) and/or regarding whom Consultant received Confidential Information, for the purpose of providing products or services (""Competitive Products/Services"").","The clause you provided is a **No-Solicit of Customers** provision, which restricts the Consultant from soliciting the Company's clients, customers, or prospective customers during the term of the agreement and for one year afterward. This is directly relevant to your query in the following ways:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **Scope of Restriction:**  
   - The Consultant is prohibited from **directly or indirectly** soliciting the Company's clients, customers, or prospective customers.  
   - The restriction applies to those with whom the Consultant had **""Material Contact""** (likely defined elsewhere in the agreement) or about whom they received **Confidential Information**.  

2. **Timeframe:**  
   - The restriction applies **during the Term** of the agreement and for **one (1) year after termination**.  

3. **Purpose of the Restriction:**  
   - The clause aims to prevent the Consultant from **diverting business opportunities** from the Company by offering **Competitive Products/Services** to the same customers.  

### **Comparison with External References:**
The external references (from M&A agreements) discuss **No-Solicitation** in the context of **acquisition proposals**, where a company may engage with third parties if a **Superior Proposal** emerges, despite general restrictions.  

- While those clauses focus on **corporate transactions** (allowing exceptions for fiduciary duties), your clause is a **post-employment restrictive covenant** aimed at **protecting customer relationships** from competitive solicitation.  
- Both types of clauses serve to **protect business interests**, but yours is narrower (applies only to the Consultant) rather than permitting exceptions for board-approved deals.  

### **Relevance to Your Query:**
- Your clause is a **standard No-Solicit of Customers** provision in a **consulting or employment agreement**, ensuring that the Consultant does not **poach clients** after the relationship ends.  
- Unlike the M&A-related clauses (which allow exceptions for superior proposals), this clause is **absolute**—it does not permit solicitation under any circumstances during the restricted period.

No-Solicit of Customers,34cf501a88,"Distributor shall be entitled to advertise, promote, market or<omitted>solicit any Customers that have a business presence outside the Territory, except that Distributor shall not conduct solicitation activities in any outside territory where Hydraspin is bound to an exclusive distributor agreement with a third party, provided that Hydraspin has notified Distributor in writing of its arrangements with the other distributor and of the territory which is subject to exclusivity in favor of the other distributor.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query **""No-Solicit of Customers""** in the following ways:

### **1. Scope of No-Solicit Obligation**  
The clause restricts the **Distributor** from soliciting customers in territories where **Hydraspin** has an exclusive distributor agreement with a third party. This aligns with the broader concept of **no-solicitation clauses**, which are common in contracts to prevent one party from actively pursuing customers or business relationships that are protected under an agreement.

### **2. Conditions for Enforcement**  
The restriction applies **only if**:  
- Hydraspin has an **exclusive distributor agreement** in the outside territory.  
- Hydraspin has **notified the Distributor in writing** about the exclusivity arrangement.  

This is similar to the external references (e.g., MAUD provisions), where exceptions to no-solicitation clauses are permitted under certain conditions (e.g., fiduciary duty exceptions in M&A contexts).

### **3. Comparison with External References**  
- The **MAUD provisions** (e.g., Section 6.03(b)) allow exceptions to no-solicitation rules if certain conditions are met (e.g., a **Superior Proposal** in M&A deals).  
- Similarly, your clause allows exceptions—**Distributor can solicit customers outside the Territory unless Hydraspin has an exclusive agreement in place and has provided notice**.  

### **4. Key Differences**  
- The **MAUD provisions** deal with **M&A transactions** (restricting a company from soliciting competing acquisition offers).  
- Your clause deals with **distribution agreements** (restricting a distributor from poaching customers in exclusive territories).  

### **Conclusion**  
Your clause is a **no-solicitation restriction** tailored to **distribution agreements**, ensuring that the Distributor does not interfere with Hydraspin’s exclusive arrangements in other territories. It is **less complex** than M&A no-solicit clauses but follows a similar principle: **restricting solicitation unless an exception applies (here, the absence of an exclusive agreement or proper notice).**

No-Solicit of Customers,ae1ddd57be,"Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former<omitted>employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period. Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the ""Non-Solicit Period""), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business.","The clause you provided is a **non-solicitation of employees** provision, which is distinct from the **no-solicitation of customers** query but falls under the broader umbrella of restrictive covenants in contracts. Here’s how it relates to your query and the external context:

### **Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Scope of Solicitation Restrictions**  
   - Your query focuses on **customer solicitation**, but the provided clause addresses **employee solicitation**. Both are common restrictive covenants in M&A or employment agreements, often appearing together in contracts to protect business interests (e.g., customer relationships and workforce stability).  
   - The external references (e.g., *maud_803* and *maud_645*) discuss **no-solicitation of acquisition proposals** (a ""no-shop"" clause), which is unrelated to employees or customers but shows how solicitation clauses are structured in M&A contexts.

2. **Key Similarities in Drafting**  
   - Like no-solicit clauses for customers, this clause:  
     - Defines a restricted period (*Non-Solicit Period = 3 years post-Closing*).  
     - Prohibits **direct/indirect** solicitation (e.g., targeting employees of the ""Combined Business"").  
     - Includes exceptions (e.g., general public job postings, ex-employees terminated ≥6 months prior).  

3. **Contrast with Customer Non-Solicit**  
   - A **customer non-solicit** would similarly restrict poaching clients but would:  
     - Define ""customers"" (e.g., those transacting within a prior timeframe).  
     - Allow exceptions (e.g., passive advertising, pre-existing relationships).  
   - Your clause’s structure (exceptions, timebound restrictions) could serve as a model for drafting a customer-focused version.

### **Practical Implications**  
- This clause protects the **Buyer’s workforce** post-acquisition, just as a customer non-solicit would protect its client base.  
- The strict prohibition on targeted hiring (even via general solicitations) mirrors how customer non-solicits often bar *targeted* outreach to specific clients.  

### **Suggested Next Steps**  
If you need a **customer no-solicit clause**, adapt this framework by:  
1. Replacing ""employees"" with ""customers"" or ""clients.""  
2. Specifying restricted actions (e.g., ""solicit for competing business"").  
3. Carving out permissible conduct (e.g., responses to RFPs, public marketing).

No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,77df66b5ca,"Each Party agrees that, during the [***] ([***]) [***] period starting from the Effective Date, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates or otherwise induce or attempt to induce such employees to terminate their employment with such other Party or such other Party's Affiliates; provided, however, that general public solicitations and advertisements not directed at employees of the other Party, and the extension of offers to persons who respond to such general solicitations and advertisements, will not be deemed violations of this provision.","The query concerns a **No-Solicit of Employees** clause that is either **not bound by time** or is **longer than 12 months**. The provided clause imposes a **fixed duration** for the no-solicitation restriction (though the exact length is redacted as `[***]`), which contrasts with the query's focus on clauses that are either **time-unlimited** or **exceed 12 months**.

### Relevance to the Query:
1. **Duration Comparison**  
   - The clause specifies a defined period (redacted) starting from the **Effective Date**, meaning it is **time-bound**.  
   - The query seeks clauses that are either **perpetual (no time limit)** or **longer than 12 months**, so this clause would only be relevant if the redacted duration is **more than 12 months**.  

2. **Scope of Restriction**  
   - The clause prohibits **direct or indirect solicitation** of employees from the other party or its affiliates.  
   - It includes an exception for **general public solicitations** (e.g., job postings not targeting the other party’s employees).  
   - This is a **standard no-poach provision**, but the query may be looking for broader or stricter terms (e.g., no carve-outs, longer duration).  

3. **External Context**  
   - The external references (e.g., *Maud_803*) discuss **no-solicitation in M&A contexts** (e.g., preventing acquisition-related poaching until deal closing).  
   - However, the provided clause is **employment-focused**, not tied to M&A, so it may not fully align with the external examples.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause is **partially relevant** to the query if:  
- The redacted period is **more than 12 months** (making it fit the ""longer than 12 months"" criterion).  
- If the duration is shorter or unspecified, it does **not** address the query’s focus on **unlimited or extended restrictions**.  

For a stronger match, the query may need clauses with:  
- **No expiration date** (e.g., ""shall not solicit at any time"").  
- **Explicitly stated long-term restrictions** (e.g., ""for 24 months"").  
- **Broader prohibitions** (e.g., no exceptions for general solicitations).

The provided clause is relevant because it:  

1. **Imposes a Time-Bound Restriction** – The **Non-Solicit Period** lasts for **three years** after the Closing Date, which exceeds the 12-month threshold mentioned in the query.  

2. **Contains Exceptions** – The clause allows solicitation under certain conditions (e.g., hiring employees terminated at least six months prior or using general solicitations not specifically targeting employees), but still **prohibits direct solicitation and hiring** during the three-year period.  

3. **Aligns with the Query’s Focus** – The query seeks clauses where employee non-solicitation is either **unlimited in duration** or **longer than 12 months**, and this clause fits the latter category.  

### Key Takeaways:  
- The **three-year restriction** is stricter than typical 6-12 month non-solicits.  
- The clause balances **prohibitions** (direct solicitation/hiring) with **permitted actions** (general solicitations, hiring long-terminated employees).  
- It is **explicitly time-bound** (unlike an indefinite restriction), but the duration is notably long.  

Thus, this clause is a strong example of a **No-Solicit provision exceeding 12 months**, which directly addresses the query.",5
No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,87addb8ad7,"Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations).","The query concerns whether a **no-solicit of employees** clause is **bound by time or limited to a duration longer than 12 months**. The provided clause explicitly addresses this by imposing a **time-bound restriction** on soliciting or hiring employees of the other party:

1. **Duration**:  
   - The restriction applies **during the term of the Agreement** and **for 12 months after termination**.  
   - This confirms the clause is temporally limited (not perpetual) and aligns with the query’s focus on whether such clauses exceed 12 months.  

2. **Comparison to External Examples**:  
   - The external clauses (e.g., *Maud_275* and *Maud_803*) govern **acquisition-related solicitations** (not employee poaching) and are tied to specific deal timelines (e.g., until termination or closing).  
   - By contrast, the clause here is **narrower** (focused on employees) and **shorter in duration** (12 months post-termination vs. indefinite or deal-contingent periods in M&A contexts).  

3. **Relevance to Query**:  
   - The clause demonstrates a **common 12-month post-termination limit** for employee no-solicits, suggesting such durations are standard.  
   - It also includes a **carve-out for general solicitations** (e.g., public job postings), which mitigates overbreadth concerns.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause is **explicitly time-bound** (12 months post-agreement) and thus **not open-ended or ""longer than 12 months""** unless explicitly negotiated otherwise. This aligns with typical market practice for employee non-solicits.",5
No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,a804319d22,"Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the ""Non-Solicit Period""), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. <omitted>

The provided clause is relevant to the query for the following reasons:

### 1. **Duration (Time Bound)**  
   - The clause imposes a **three-year Non-Solicit Period**, which is significantly longer than the typical **12-month** restriction often seen in employment or M&A agreements.  
   - This directly addresses the query's concern about a no-solicit provision that exceeds the standard 12-month limit.  

### 2. **Scope of Restriction**  
   - The clause prohibits Sellers from:  
     - **Inducing, soliciting, or recruiting** employees of the **Combined Business** (Buyer or its subsidiaries).  
     - **Hiring** any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.  
   - This is broader than some no-solicit clauses that only restrict direct solicitation, as it also covers indirect attempts (e.g., through third parties).  

### 3. **Exceptions (Carve-Outs)**  
   - The clause includes **permitted solicitations**, such as:  
     1. Hiring **former employees** whose employment ended at least **six months prior** to solicitation.  
     2. **General solicitations** (e.g., public job postings) that are not specifically targeted at the Combined Business’s employees.  
   - These exceptions mitigate the otherwise strict prohibition, but the **three-year ban on hiring** remains enforceable.  

### 4. **Comparison to External References**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **MAUD_803** and **MAUD_645**) focus on **no-solicitation of acquisition proposals** (not employees) and are time-bound to the **Effective Time** or **Pre-Closing Period**.  
   - By contrast, the provided clause is **employee-specific** and imposes a **fixed three-year post-closing restriction**, making it more relevant to the query.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is a strong example of a **long-term (three-year) no-solicit restriction on employees**, which aligns with the query’s focus on provisions that exceed the typical 12-month limit. The exceptions provide some flexibility, but the core prohibition remains stringent and time-bound.

No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,f4f18fbcb1,"During the term hereof and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, each Party agrees not to, either directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of any other person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity hire, solicit, contract for, attempt to solicit, or cause to be solicited, the employment or services of any current or previous employee of the other Party (unless a period of sixty months has elapsed from the last date that such employee was employed by such party) without the prior written consent of such other Party.","The query concerns a **No-Solicit of Employees** clause that is either **not bound by time** or **extends beyond 12 months**. The provided clause is relevant because:  

1. **Duration Beyond 12 Months** – The clause imposes a **five (5)-year restriction** on soliciting employees, which is significantly longer than the 12-month threshold mentioned in the query.  

2. **No Time Limit for Certain Employees** – The clause also includes a carve-out for employees who have been separated from the company for **60 months (5 years)**. This means that for employees who left **more than 5 years ago**, the restriction no longer applies, but for all others, the **5-year ban remains in effect**.  

3. **Comparison with External References** – The external references discuss restrictions tied to the **Effective Time** or **termination of the agreement**, but they do not specify a fixed duration like the clause in question. This makes the clause stricter in terms of time-bound restrictions.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query:**  
- The clause **exceeds the 12-month limit** (it lasts 5 years).  
- It **does not fully lack a time limit**, but it applies for a **very long duration** before expiring.  
- The **60-month carve-out** means the restriction is not indefinite, but it is still much longer than typical 6-12 month no-solicit clauses.  

Thus, this clause is a strong example of a **long-term (5-year) no-solicit provision**, which aligns with the query’s focus on extended or indefinite restrictions.",5
Non-Disparagement,4e171b11c4,"Subject to applicable law, each of the Parties covenants and agrees that, during the Standstill Period, neither Party nor any of its subsidiaries, Affiliates, successors, assigns, principals, partners, members, general partners, officers, key employees or directors (collectively, ""Representatives""), shall in any way, directly or indirectly, in any capacity or manner, whether written or oral, electronically or otherwise (including, without limitation, in a television, radio, internet, newspaper, magazine interview, or otherwise through the press, media, analysts or other persons or in any document or report filed with the SEC), publicly disparage, impugn, make ad hominem attacks on or otherwise defame or slander or make, express, transmit, speak, write, verbalize or otherwise publicly communicate in any way (or cause, further, assist, solicit, encourage, support or participate in any of the foregoing), any public communication or statement of any kind, whether verbal, in writing, electronically transferred or otherwise, that might reasonably be construed to be disparage, derogate or impugn, the other Party or such other Party's Representatives (including any current officer or director of a Party or a Parties' subsidiaries who no longer serves in such capacity following the execution of this Agreement), employees, stockholders (solely in their capacity as stockholders of the applicable Party), or any of their businesses, products or services, in any manner that would reasonably be expected to damage the business, or reputation of the other Party or of its Representatives (including former officers and directors), directors (or former directors), employees, stockholders (solely in their capacity as stockholders of the applicable Party); provided that, with respect to any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding between the Parties, nothing in this Section 5 shall prevent either Party from disclosing any facts or circumstances with respect to any such litigation, arbitration or other proceeding.","The **Non-Disparagement** clause you provided is directly responsive to your query, as it establishes a mutual obligation between the parties to refrain from making negative public statements about each other during the **Standstill Period**. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Scope of Prohibited Conduct**:  
   - The clause prohibits **disparagement**, **ad hominem attacks**, **defamation**, or **slander** in any form (written, oral, electronic, media, SEC filings, etc.).  
   - It covers not only the parties themselves but also their **Representatives** (e.g., subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees).  

2. **Protected Parties**:  
   - Extends protection to the other party’s **business, reputation, products, services, employees, stockholders, and former officers/directors**.  
   - Ensures that public communications do not harm the other party’s interests.  

3. **Exceptions**:  
   - Allows factual disclosures in **litigation, arbitration, or legal proceedings** between the parties.  
   - Subject to **applicable law** (e.g., defamation laws, regulatory requirements).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause aligns with the broader contractual intent seen in the **external information** (e.g., restrictions on solicitation and confidentiality in M&A contexts). While the external excerpts focus on **Acquisition Proposals** and **Representatives’ conduct**, your clause specifically addresses **reputational harm** through public statements.  
- Both contexts emphasize **controlling communications** (e.g., prohibiting disparagement vs. prohibiting solicitation of competing bids) to protect transactional integrity or business relationships.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Standstill Period**: Likely tied to a specific timeline (e.g., during negotiations or post-transaction), similar to the temporal limits in the external examples (e.g., until termination of the agreement).  
- **Enforceability**: Violations could lead to claims for breach of contract or defamation, depending on jurisdiction.  

In summary, this **Non-Disparagement** clause is a **reputational safeguard**, ensuring parties avoid public criticism that could undermine trust or damage business interests, while carving out necessary exceptions for legal proceedings. It complements the restrictive covenants seen in the external materials by addressing a different but equally critical aspect of contractual conduct.",5

Each party agrees that it will use all reasonable commercial efforts to prevent its employees from making any Disparaging Communications regarding the other party and/or the other party's products, services, officers, directors, shareholders, employees or investors; provided, however, that nothing in this Section (11), subparagraph (j) shall restrict or impede the exercise of any rights or remedies of a Party under this Agreement.","The provided clause is a **Non-Disparagement** provision, which directly addresses the query by imposing mutual obligations on the parties (Agent and Kallo) to avoid making negative or harmful statements about each other during the term of the agreement and for **two years thereafter**. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **Scope of Prohibition**:  
   - The parties are barred from making any written or oral communication (""Communication"") to third parties (e.g., customers, suppliers, competitors) that could disparage or reflect negatively on the other party, its products, services, or stakeholders (officers, employees, etc.).  
   - This includes opinions, judgments, or factual representations that could harm the other party’s reputation (""Disparaging Communication"").

2. **Duration**:  
   - The restriction applies during the term of the agreement and extends for **two years post-termination**, ensuring ongoing protection of reputational interests.

3. **Employee Accountability**:  
   - Each party must use **reasonable commercial efforts** to prevent its employees from making disparaging remarks, though the clause does not impose strict liability for employee actions.

4. **Exceptions**:  
   - The clause explicitly carves out the right to exercise legal rights or remedies under the agreement (e.g., litigation, arbitration), ensuring it does not stifle legitimate disputes.

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause is a **standalone Non-Disparagement obligation**, distinct from the external examples provided (which relate to **No-Solicitation** clauses).  
- While the external information discusses restrictions on soliciting third parties or sharing confidential information, this clause focuses solely on **protecting reputational integrity** by prohibiting harmful communications.  
- It balances restrictive covenants with carve-outs for legal enforcement, similar to the exceptions seen in the No-Solicitation clauses (e.g., allowing confidential proposals to the board).  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Reputation Management**: Prevents public criticism that could damage business relationships or market perception.  
- **Enforceability**: The specificity (defining ""Disparaging Communication"") and temporal limit (two years) enhance enforceability.  
- **Alignment with Broader Agreement**: Complements other restrictive covenants (like confidentiality or non-solicitation) by safeguarding intangible interests (goodwill, brand value).  

In summary, this clause directly responds to the query by establishing clear, time-bound prohibitions against disparagement, with safeguards for legitimate business needs.",5
Non-Disparagement,a399eeff41,"The Client and the Designer both agree to never to disparage or speak ill of the other party to anyone and or post negative or disparaging comments Online regarding any of the Designer's products, services, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees or shareholders, and will take reasonable steps to prevent and will not knowingly permit any of their respective employees or agents to, disparage or speak ill of such persons. The Client and Designer both agree not to post on defamatory websites or review websites any negative posts concerning each other, the names of our companies, and our employees.","The **Non-Disparagement** clause in the provided contract is directly relevant to the query because it establishes mutual obligations between the **Client** and the **Designer** to refrain from making negative or harmful statements about each other, their businesses, or associated individuals (employees, affiliates, etc.). Here’s how it aligns with the broader context of non-disparagement clauses, including the external references:

### Key Relevance Points:
1. **Mutual Restriction on Negative Statements**  
   - Both parties agree not to **disparage** or **speak ill** of each other, mirroring the restrictions seen in the external examples (e.g., prohibitions on actions without prior consent in M&A contexts).  
   - The clause extends to **online posts**, **review websites**, and **defamatory platforms**, which is stricter than the general corporate examples provided (where restrictions are tied to business operations).

2. **Scope of Coverage**  
   - The clause protects not just the parties but also their **affiliates, employees, and representatives**, similar to how the external examples reference subsidiaries and require consent for actions affecting broader entities.  
   - It explicitly includes **products, services, and corporate reputation**, ensuring comprehensive protection akin to the corporate agreements’ focus on business interests.

3. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Both parties must take **reasonable steps** to prevent their employees/agents from violating the clause, reflecting the external examples’ emphasis on controlling subsidiary/third-party actions (e.g., ""cause each Company Subsidiary not to"").  

4. **Enforcement and Permitted Exceptions**  
   - Unlike the external examples (which allow exceptions with consent or legal requirements), this clause is absolute, with no carve-outs for disclosures required by law or approved by the other party. This suggests a stricter, more personal agreement.  

### Comparison to External References:  
- The corporate examples (e.g., M&A contexts) focus on **business conduct** and require **parent consent** for restricted actions, while this clause is a **mutual personal/business conduct rule** with no exceptions.  
- Both contexts, however, share the goal of **protecting reputation** and preventing harm to associated entities.  

### Practical Implications:  
This clause is broader in some ways (covering online speech) but narrower in others (lacking exceptions for legal compliance). It’s particularly relevant to **service-based contracts** where public perception is critical, whereas the external examples govern **corporate transactions**.  

Would you like any refinements to align this clause with corporate-style exceptions (e.g., carve-outs for legal requirements)?",5
Non-Disparagement,9cc5d7efc1,"Any assignment in derogation of the foregoing shall be null and void. Neither party may<omitted>assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement to any person or entity without the
other's written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that the withholding of consent of assignment to a competitor of the other party shall be deemed reasonable.","The query relates to **Non-Disparagement**, but the provided clause pertains to **Assignment and Transfer** restrictions in an agreement. While the two concepts are distinct, I can explain their relevance based on the context provided:

### **Relevance to Non-Disparagement (Indirect Connection)**  
1. **Consent Requirement & Reasonableness Standard**  
   - The clause states that neither party can assign the agreement without the other party’s written consent, which **""shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.""**  
   - This mirrors language in the external examples (e.g., *""consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned""*), suggesting a broader contractual principle that may also apply to **non-disparagement clauses**.  
   - If a non-disparagement clause exists, parties might similarly be restricted from making harmful statements unless an exception (e.g., mutual consent) applies.  

2. **Competitor Exception as a Parallel Concept**  
   - The clause explicitly allows withholding consent for assignments to **competitors**, deeming it reasonable.  
   - Similarly, a non-disparagement clause might include exceptions (e.g., disparagement toward competitors may be permitted if the agreement carves it out).  

### **Key Difference**  
- **Assignment Clause**: Governs transfer of contractual rights.  
- **Non-Disparagement Clause**: Prohibits harmful statements about the other party.  

### **Why This Clause Was Retrieved**  
The external examples highlight a recurring theme: **unreasonable withholding of consent is prohibited**. This standard could extend to non-disparagement terms (e.g., one party may not unreasonably block the other from making factual statements). However, the provided clause itself does not address disparagement directly.

Non-Disparagement,0a7a0ec21c,"Neither Party shall do or cause to be done any act or thing that may in any way adversely affect any rights of the other Party in and to such other Party's Marks or any registrations thereof or that, directly or indirectly, may reduce the value of such Marks or detract from any Mark's reputation, including challenging the ownership, validity or enforceability of such Marks.","The clause you provided is a **non-disparagement provision** (or a related protection clause) in the context of intellectual property (specifically, trademarks or ""Marks""). Here’s how it aligns with the query and why it’s relevant:

### **Relevance to Non-Disparagement:**
1. **Prohibition on Harmful Acts**:  
   The clause explicitly prohibits either party from taking actions that could harm the other party's Marks, including acts that might **disparage or undermine** their value, reputation, or legal standing (e.g., challenging ownership or validity). This is a form of non-disparagement, as it prevents negative statements or actions that could damage the other party's brand or intellectual property.

2. **Indirect Disparagement**:  
   While not a classic ""non-disparagement"" clause (which typically bars negative public statements), this provision covers **functional equivalents**, such as:  
   - Legal challenges to the Marks (e.g., disputing validity in court).  
   - Public acts that could diminish the Marks' reputation (e.g., associating them with inferior products).  

3. **Enforcement Mechanism**:  
   The external information (Section 10.12) highlights that breaches of the agreement (including this clause) may entitle parties to **injunctive relief** (e.g., court orders to stop disparaging acts) without needing to prove monetary damages. This reinforces the clause’s enforceability, similar to how non-disparagement clauses are typically upheld.

4. **Alignment with Broader Agreement**:  
   The clause supports the agreement’s goal of protecting mutual interests (like the Merger referenced in the external text) by ensuring neither party’s intellectual property is undermined, which could disrupt business value or goodwill.

### **Key Takeaway:**  
This clause is a **specialized non-disparagement provision focused on intellectual property**. It prevents parties from harming each other’s Marks through legal challenges or reputational harm, with remedies akin to traditional non-disparagement enforcement (e.g., injunctions).  

If you need a stricter ""classic"" non-disparagement clause (e.g., prohibiting negative public statements), you might add language explicitly covering verbal/written remarks. However, this clause achieves a similar protective effect in the IP context.",5

If the Company does not timely deliver a ROFO Purchase Notice it shall be deemed to have waived all of its rights with respect to the offer contained in the ROFO Sale Notice.","The query relates to **ROFR (Right of First Refusal), ROFO (Right of First Offer), and ROFRN (Right of First Negotiation)**—common contractual mechanisms that govern transfer restrictions and preferential purchase rights in agreements involving equity or asset sales.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query**  
The provided clause extensively details the **ROFR and ROFO** mechanisms applicable to the **Farids Group** concerning the transfer of shares. Here’s how it aligns with the query:  

1. **ROFR (Right of First Refusal)**  
   - The clause mandates that before the Farids Group can transfer shares (**ROFR Shares**) to a third party, they must first offer those shares to the **Company** (or its designee) under the same terms.  
   - The Company has **3 business days** to respond with a **ROFR Purchase Notice**; failure to do so waives its rights.  
   - If the Company declines, the Farids Group may proceed with the third-party sale within a **3-business-day ROFR Transfer Period**.  

2. **ROFO (Right of First Offer)**  
   - For **144 Sales** (likely Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act), the Farids Group must issue a **ROFO Sale Notice** at least **48 hours** before initiating the sale.  
   - The Company has until **8:00 a.m. (NY time)** on the proposed sale date to submit a **ROFO Purchase Notice** if it wishes to buy the shares.  
   - If the Company does not respond, the Farids Group may sell the shares in the open market, but **not below the ROFO Sale Price**.  

3. **Key Restrictions & Procedures**  
   - **Frequency Limitation**: The Farids Group cannot issue more than **one ROFR/ROFO Sale Notice every 30 days**.  
   - **Material Changes Trigger New Notice**: If a proposed transfer fails (e.g., not completed within the ROFR/ROFO Transfer Period), a **new notice must be issued**, restarting the process.  
   - **Competitor Restrictions**: Transfers to **material competitors** require additional scrutiny and advance notice (**5 business days** for ROFR, **48 hours** for ROFO).  

### **Connection to External References**  
While the external references discuss **Superior Proposal** dynamics in M&A (e.g., notice periods for competing bids), the clause here focuses on **preemptive rights in share transfers**. Both contexts involve:  
- **Notice requirements** (e.g., 4-day notice for Superior Proposals vs. 3-day ROFR response).  
- **Material modifications resetting timelines** (similar to how financial term changes in a Superior Proposal trigger a new 2-day notice).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is a **detailed ROFR/ROFO framework** governing how the Farids Group must offer shares to the Company before selling to third parties, with strict timelines, notice requirements, and restrictions on competitor sales. It directly answers the query by illustrating how **ROFR and ROFO** operate in practice, including procedural safeguards and consequences for non-compliance.

Rofr/Rofo/Rofn,d90ac097df,"XSPA shall give prompt written notice to Calm each time it offers, proposes to offer, or has received an offer to enter into any agreement or arrangement under which XSPA or any of its affiliates would sell, offer for sale, market, promote or undertake any similar action with respect to any meditation or sleep digital products or similar products at any Store outside the Territory (each, a ""ROFR Notice"").<omitted>If Calm exercises its ROFR within the ROFR Period, the Parties shall enter into an amendment or addendum to this Agreement to include such additional region and/or Stores.<omitted>If Calm does not exercise its ROFR within the ROFR Period, XSPA may enter into such agreement or arrangement with respect to the applicable region and/or Stores set forth in the ROFR Notice with any third party; provided that, such agreement or arrangement are on the same terms offered to Calm (it being understood that in the event XSPA modifies such terms, XSPA shall provide a new ROFR Notice to Calm in accordance with this Section \u200b3.02).<omitted>Throughout the Term and for a period of six (6) months after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Calm shall have a right of first refusal to expand the rights and obligations described in this Agreement to any Stores outside the Territory (the ""ROFR"").<omitted>Calm shall have thirty (30) business days (the ""ROFR Period"") from receipt of a ROFR Notice to exercise its ROFR with respect to the region and/or Stores described in the ROFR Notice.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **ROFR (Right of First Refusal), ROFO (Right of First Offer), and ROFN (Right of First Negotiation)** because it explicitly defines and operationalizes a **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)** in a contractual context. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance to ROFR/ROFO/ROFN:
1. **Definition of ROFR**:  
   - The clause clearly establishes Calm's **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)** to expand the agreement's scope to new regions or stores outside the Territory.  
   - This is a classic ROFR structure where the holder (Calm) must be given the opportunity to match any third-party offer before XSPA can proceed.

2. **Mechanics of ROFR**:  
   - **Notice Requirement**: XSPA must provide a **ROFR Notice** to Calm when it receives or proposes an offer for expansion.  
   - **Exercise Window**: Calm has **30 business days (ROFR Period)** to exercise its ROFR after receiving the notice.  
   - **Matching Terms**: If Calm exercises the ROFR, the parties must amend the agreement to include the new region/stores. If Calm declines, XSPA may proceed with a third party **only on the same terms** offered to Calm.  

3. **Modification Triggers New ROFR**:  
   - The clause includes a critical provision: if XSPA later modifies the terms of the third-party offer, it must issue a **new ROFR Notice** to Calm. This mirrors the external examples (e.g., material amendments to a ""Superior Proposal"" requiring renewed notice periods).  

4. **Temporal Scope**:  
   - The ROFR is active during the **Term and for 6 months post-termination**, ensuring Calm retains priority even after the agreement ends.  

### Connection to External Examples:  
The external snippets discuss:  
- **Material amendments** triggering renewed notice obligations (e.g., 2-business-day notice for modified Superior Proposals).  
- **Termination rights** tied to superior proposals (similar to ROFR dynamics where the holder’s refusal allows third-party deals).  

Your clause similarly ties **modified terms** to a renewed ROFR process, ensuring the holder (Calm) retains its priority right. This parallels the ""material amendment"" logic in the external examples but applies it to ROFR mechanics.  

### Why This Matters for ROFR/ROFO/ROFN:  
- **ROFR**: Your clause is a textbook example, emphasizing notice, matching rights, and term modifications.  
- **ROFO vs. ROFR**: Unlike a Right of First Offer (ROFO), where the holder gets the first chance to make an offer, this clause focuses on **matching** existing third-party terms (ROFR).  
- **ROFN**: Not directly applicable here, as there’s no obligation to negotiate exclusively with Calm first.  

### Summary:  
This clause is a **detailed ROFR provision** that aligns with broader contractual concepts (like notice periods and material changes) seen in the external examples. It demonstrates how ROFRs are structured to protect the holder’s priority while allowing the grantor (XSPA) flexibility—provided the holder’s rights are respected.

Rofr/Rofo/Rofn,051c3e266c,"All communication with the National Football League (the ""NFL""), its 32 Member Clubs, NFL Legends and Gold Jackets shall be made exclusively and directly through PFHOF. For the avoidance of doubt, PFHOF has the exclusive and sole relationship with the NFL, its 32 Member Clubs, NFL Legends and Gold Jackets for any and all PFHOF and HOFV activities; provided, however, that any communication relating to any investment by the NFL in any Village Media Company project, may be made directly through the President of PFHOF or the Chief Executive Officer of HOFV; and, provided further, that the Village Media Company shall have the right to present opportunities related to any of the above for approval by PFHOF.","The query relates to **ROFR/ROFO/ROFN** (Right of First Refusal/Right of First Offer/Right of First Negotiation), which are contractual rights granting a party priority in purchasing, offering, or negotiating an asset before others.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to ROFR/ROFO/ROFN:**  
1. **Exclusive Communication Rights (Implied ROFR-like Control):**  
   - The clause mandates that **all communication** with the NFL, its clubs, and related entities must go through **PFHOF**, effectively giving PFHOF control over interactions that could involve commercial opportunities (e.g., investments, partnerships).  
   - This resembles a **ROFR/ROFO** mechanism because PFHOF has the **exclusive right to manage relationships** (akin to a right to ""first"" engagement), preventing other parties (e.g., Village Media Company) from bypassing PFHOF unless explicitly allowed (e.g., for NFL investments).  

2. **Conditional Exceptions (Similar to ROFR Waivers):**  
   - The clause carves out exceptions where direct communication is permitted (e.g., NFL investments via PFHOF’s President or HOFV’s CEO).  
   - This mirrors how **ROFR clauses often include exceptions** (e.g., permitted transfers, third-party consents). Here, PFHOF’s ""consent"" is structurally similar to a ROFR waiver.  

3. **Approval Rights (ROFN Element):**  
   - Village Media Company must **present opportunities to PFHOF for approval**, which aligns with a **Right of First Negotiation (ROFN)**—PFHOF gets the first chance to review/approve proposals before external action is taken.  

### **Connection to External References:**  
- The external examples highlight contractual restrictions requiring **consent** (e.g., ""otherwise consented to by Labrador in writing"") or exceptions for permitted actions.  
- Similarly, this clause restricts actions (communication) unless PFHOF approves or an exception applies, reinforcing a **ROFR/ROFO-like framework** where PFHOF holds priority rights.  

### **Conclusion:**  
While not explicitly labeled as a ROFR/ROFO/ROFN, the clause functionally operates like one by:  
- Granting **PFHOF exclusive control** over key relationships (akin to a right of first refusal).  
- Requiring **PFHOF’s approval** for certain opportunities (similar to a right of first negotiation).  
- Allowing **exceptions only under defined conditions** (common in ROFR clauses).  

This aligns with the query’s focus on contractual mechanisms that prioritize one party’s rights over others.",5
Rofr/Rofo/Rofn,983ac1cfab,"All communication with the National Football League (the ""NFL""), its 32 Member Clubs, NFL Legends and Gold Jackets shall be made exclusively and directly through PFHOF.<omitted>For the avoidance of doubt, PFHOF has the exclusive and sole relationship with the NFL, its 32 Member Clubs, NFL Legends and Gold Jackets for any and all PFHOF and HOFV activities; provided, however, that any communication relating to any investment by the NFL in any Village Media Company project, may be made directly through the President of PFHOF or the Chief Executive Officer of HOFV; and, provided further, that the Village Media Company shall have the right to present opportunities related to any of the above for approval by PFHOF.","The query mentions **ROFR/ROFO/ROFN** (Right of First Refusal/Right of First Offer/Right of First Negotiation), which are contractual rights that give a party priority in purchasing, receiving offers, or negotiating for certain assets or opportunities before others.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to ROFR/ROFO/ROFN:**  
1. **Exclusive Communication & Control** – The clause establishes that **PFHOF** has the **exclusive and sole relationship** with the NFL, its Member Clubs, and related entities for all PFHOF and HOFV activities. This implies that any business dealings (including potential investments, partnerships, or commercial opportunities) must go through PFHOF first, which could function similarly to a **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)** or **Right of First Offer (ROFO)** by giving PFHOF control over such engagements.  

2. **Exception for Direct Communication (Investment-Related)** – The clause allows **direct communication** only for NFL investments in Village Media Company projects, but only through specific executives (President of PFHOF or CEO of HOFV). This suggests that while PFHOF retains oversight, certain investment-related discussions may bypass full ROFR/ROFO restrictions if conducted through authorized channels.  

3. **Village Media Company’s Right to Present Opportunities** – The clause states that Village Media Company can **present opportunities** to PFHOF for approval. This resembles a **Right of First Negotiation (ROFN)**, where PFHOF has the first opportunity to review and approve (or reject) proposed deals before they proceed.  

### **Comparison to External References:**  
- The external clauses (e.g., *""Golden shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to""* without consent) similarly restrict actions unless exceptions apply (consent, legal requirements, etc.).  
- The PFHOF clause functions similarly by restricting direct NFL communications unless under specified conditions (investment-related discussions or prior approval).  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause effectively **implements a form of ROFR/ROFO/ROFN** by:  
- Requiring PFHOF’s **exclusive control** over NFL-related dealings (akin to ROFR).  
- Allowing **limited exceptions** under strict conditions (similar to carve-outs in ROFR clauses).  
- Granting PFHOF **approval rights** over opportunities (resembling ROFN).

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance to ROFR/ROFO/ROFN:
1. **Definition of ROFR**:  
   The clause grants **Calm** a **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)** to expand the agreement's scope to stores outside a defined ""Territory."" This means XSPA must first offer any opportunity to Calm before entering into a similar agreement with a third party.

2. **Mechanics of ROFR**:  
   - **Notice Requirement**: XSPA must provide a **ROFR Notice** to Calm when it receives or proposes an offer for covered products outside the Territory.  
   - **Exercise Window**: Calm has **30 business days (ROFR Period)** to accept or reject the offer.  
   - **Binding Effect**: If Calm exercises the ROFR, the parties must amend the agreement to include the new region/stores.  

3. **Modification Triggers New ROFR**:  
   Similar to the ""material amendment"" concept in the external examples (e.g., changes to a ""Superior Proposal"" requiring a new notice period), this clause states that if XSPA modifies the terms of the third-party offer, it must issue a **new ROFR Notice** to Calm. This mirrors the external examples where material changes reset notice obligations (e.g., reducing the notice period to 2 business days for amended proposals).

4. **Comparison to ROFO/ROFN**:  
   - **ROFO (Right of First Offer)**: The clause functions like a ROFR (not ROFO), as it is triggered by an existing third-party offer rather than requiring XSPA to offer the opportunity to Calm *before* seeking third parties.  
   - **ROFN (Right of First Negotiation)**: Not applicable here, as the clause does not grant Calm exclusive negotiation rights before XSPA engages with others.

### Link to External Context:  
The external examples highlight contractual mechanisms for **notice obligations** and **material changes** (e.g., reduced notice periods for amended proposals). Similarly, this ROFR clause:  
- Imposes a notice requirement (ROFR Notice).  
- Resets the process if terms change (new ROFR Notice).  
- Specifies a fixed response period (30 days, akin to the 2-day notice reduction in the external examples).  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a **classic ROFR provision** that ensures Calm has priority to match third-party offers under defined conditions. Its structure aligns with broader contract principles seen in the external examples (e.g., material changes triggering renewed obligations). It does not create a ROFO or ROFN but is a clear example of how ROFRs are implemented in agreements.  

**Practical Implication**: If XSPA later modifies terms with a third party, Calm retains its ROFR rights, ensuring fairness and transparency—much like the ""Superior Proposal"" safeguards in the external excerpts.",5
Change Of Control,03c6d7e0ef,"For purposes of this Agreement, ""Change in Control"" means a merger or consolidation of the party with, or any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of such party to, any other person, corporation or entity, unless as a result of such merger, consolidation or sale of assets the holders of such party\'s voting securities prior thereto hold at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the surviving or successor corporation after such transaction.","The **""Change in Control""** clause is highly relevant to the query because it defines a critical trigger event in contractual agreements, particularly in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) or corporate transactions. Here’s how it connects to the broader context:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Definition of Trigger Event**:  
   The clause specifies what constitutes a ""Change in Control"" (e.g., merger, consolidation, or asset sale) and sets conditions under which such an event would legally qualify. This is foundational for determining rights, obligations, or termination triggers in contracts (e.g., acceleration of vesting, payment clauses, or termination rights).

2. **Link to ""Material Adverse Change"" (External Context)**:  
   - The external information defines **""Company Material Adverse Change""** (MAC), which often interacts with ""Change in Control"" clauses. For example:
     - A MAC may exempt certain changes (e.g., market-wide events) from triggering a breach if a Change in Control occurs.  
     - Conversely, a Change in Control might itself be excluded from constituting a MAC (as seen in clauses (C) and (D) of the external text, which exclude transaction-related impacts from MAC definitions).  
   - The clause ensures that only specific, qualifying transactions (where prior shareholders retain <50% control) are deemed a Change in Control, avoiding ambiguity.

3. **Protection for Parties**:  
   - The **50% voting power threshold** ensures continuity of control for existing shareholders. If met, the transaction may not trigger certain contractual consequences (e.g., default provisions or change-of-control payments).  
   - This aligns with the MAC exceptions in the external text (e.g., actions required by the agreement or consented to by Parent are excluded from MAC assessments).

4. **Alignment with Broader Contractual Framework**:  
   - In M&A agreements, ""Change in Control"" clauses often work alongside MAC clauses to allocate risk. For instance:  
     - A MAC might allow a buyer to walk away if adverse changes occur pre-closing.  
     - A Change in Control clause could define post-transaction governance (e.g., survival of rights if control shifts).  

### Practical Implications:
- **Due Diligence**: Parties assess whether a potential Change in Control meets the 50% threshold to avoid unintended triggers.  
- **Negotiation**: The clause’s specificity (e.g., ""substantially all assets"") may be debated to narrow/broaden its scope.  
- **Risk Mitigation**: The external MAC exceptions (e.g., for industry-wide changes) may influence how ""Change in Control"" is interpreted if linked to material adverse effects.  

In summary, the clause provides a clear, objective standard for control shifts, which is critical for enforcing other contractual terms (like MAC clauses) and ensuring transactional certainty. Its relevance lies in defining the boundary between ordinary corporate actions and transformative events that warrant contractual consequences.",5
Change Of Control,7b8bc71173,"For purposes of this Agreement, ""Change in Control"" means a merger or consolidation of the party with, or any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of such party to, any other person, corporation or entity, unless as a result of such merger, consolidation or sale of assets the holders of such party's voting securities prior thereto hold at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the surviving or successor corporation after such transaction.","The **""Change in Control""** clause defines the circumstances under which a significant change in ownership or control of a party (e.g., a company) occurs, typically triggering specific rights or obligations under the agreement. Here’s how it relates to the query and the provided external information:

### **Relevance to the Query (""Change of Control"")**  
1. **Definition of Change in Control**  
   - The clause specifies that a **merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all assets** constitutes a Change in Control, unless the original shareholders retain **at least 50% of voting power** in the surviving entity.  
   - This is a common legal threshold to determine whether control has effectively shifted to a new entity or person.

2. **Connection to ""Company Material Adverse Change"" (External Info)**  
   - The external information defines **""Company Material Adverse Change"" (MAC)** as events that could materially harm the company’s business, financial condition, or ability to complete a transaction.  
   - A **Change in Control** could itself be a **triggering event** for assessing whether a MAC has occurred (e.g., if the merger disrupts operations or financial stability).  
   - Conversely, some **MAC exclusions** (e.g., general economic downturns, industry changes) may still apply even if a Change in Control happens, unless the impact is **disproportionately adverse** to the company.

3. **Practical Implications**  
   - If a **Change in Control** occurs, parties may need to assess whether it causes a **MAC** (e.g., if the transaction harms the company disproportionately compared to peers).  
   - The **50% voting power retention** acts as a safeguard—if original shareholders retain control, the transaction may not be deemed a full Change in Control, potentially avoiding MAC-related consequences.

### **Key Takeaways**  
- The **Change in Control clause** sets the legal threshold for ownership shifts.  
- The **MAC definition** (from external info) helps determine whether such a change has materially adverse effects.  
- Together, these clauses help parties manage risks in mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales by defining when control shifts and what constitutes a material negative impact.

Change Of Control,408907bf9f,"[ * ] expected to experience, or [ * ] is experiencing, such Change of Control shall notify [ * ] in writing of this before or within [ * ] after the Change of Control. For the avoidance of doubt, if following [ * ] there is a transfer of shareholding or interests in Distributor to any existing or new shareholder(s) which results in any person or persons subsequently gaining Control of Distributor, then Google may exercise its right to terminate in accordance with this clause 5.4. [ * ] may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if there is a Change of Control of [ * ]. In this Clause the term ""Control"" shall mean the possession by any person(s) directly or indirectly of the power to direct or cause the direction of another person and ""Change of Control"" is to be construed accordingly. For the avoidance of doubt, a Change of Control shall be deemed an assignment hereunder unless [ * ] does not exercise its [ * ].","The **""Change of Control""** clause you provided is relevant to the query in several ways, particularly in the context of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and corporate transactions. Here’s how it connects to the external information and the broader legal implications:

### **1. Definition and Triggering Events**  
- The clause defines **""Control""** and **""Change of Control""** (CoC) broadly, capturing situations where a person or entity gains the power to direct another entity (e.g., through share transfers, mergers, or acquisitions).  
- This aligns with the external references (e.g., **""Superior Proposal""**, **""Alternative Acquisition Agreement""**) where a change in control could result from a competing acquisition offer.  

### **2. Notification Obligations**  
- The clause requires the party undergoing a CoC (**Distributor** in this case) to notify the other party (**Google**) **before or within [ * ] after** the event.  
- This is similar to provisions in the external documents (e.g., **Section 5.03** and **Section 8.1(j)**), where a company must follow specific procedures (e.g., board approval, notice to the other party) before accepting a **Superior Proposal** or terminating an agreement due to a CoC.  

### **3. Termination Rights**  
- The clause grants **Google** the right to **terminate immediately upon written notice** if a CoC occurs.  
- This mirrors termination rights in the external references (e.g., **Section 8.1(j)**), where a company can terminate an agreement to accept a **Superior Offer**, provided certain conditions (e.g., board approval, payment of termination fees) are met.  

### **4. Assignment Restrictions & Anti-Avoidance**  
- The clause clarifies that a CoC is **deemed an assignment** unless the non-affected party (**Google**) does not exercise its termination right.  
- This prevents circumvention of assignment restrictions (common in M&A deals) by structuring transactions as share transfers rather than direct asset sales.  

### **Key Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause ensures that **Google retains control** over its contractual relationship if the **Distributor undergoes a material ownership change** (e.g., acquisition by a competitor).  
- It complements the external references by providing a **standardized CoC mechanism**, similar to how **Superior Proposals** trigger termination rights in M&A agreements.  

### **Conclusion**  
This **Change of Control clause** is a **protective mechanism** that:  
1. **Defines triggering events** (similar to **Superior Proposals** in M&A).  
2. **Imposes notification duties** (like in **Section 5.03**).  
3. **Grants termination rights** (akin to **Section 8.1(j)**).  
4. **Prevents assignment circumvention** (ensuring contractual stability).  

Thus, it serves a similar function to the **termination and board recommendation provisions** in the external M&A documents but is tailored to a **distribution/commercial agreement** rather than a merger.",5
Change Of Control,57189aba97,"A change of control shall be deemed an assignment requiring consent hereunder provided that any transfer or assignment that results in Seller's and Buyer's current common parent, Reynolds Group Holdings Limited, ceasing to control either party shall not require consent of the other party. This Agreement, its rights and obligations, is not assignable or transferable by either Party, in whole or in part, except with the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.","The clause you provided addresses the concept of **""Change of Control""** in the context of assignment and consent requirements in a contract. Here’s how it relates to the query and the external information:

### Relevance to the Query (""Change of Control""):
1. **Definition of Change of Control as Assignment**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that a **change of control** (e.g., a merger, acquisition, or other transaction altering the controlling entity of a party) will be treated as an **assignment** under the agreement.  
   - This means that if either the Seller or Buyer undergoes a change of control, it triggers the same consent requirements as a direct assignment of the agreement.

2. **Exception for Common Parent**:  
   - The clause carves out an exception: if the change of control involves **Reynolds Group Holdings Limited** (the current common parent of both Seller and Buyer) ceasing to control either party, **no consent** is required from the other party.  
   - This suggests that internal restructuring within the Reynolds Group hierarchy is exempt from consent obligations.

3. **General Assignment Restrictions**:  
   - The clause reiterates that the agreement is **not assignable or transferable** without the **prior written consent** of the other party, which cannot be ""unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.""  
   - This aligns with the external information (e.g., MAUD clauses), where consent is required for certain actions during the agreement term, and such consent must not be unreasonably withheld.

### Connection to External Information:
- The external excerpts (e.g., MAUD clauses) emphasize that during the agreement period, the Company (and its subsidiaries) cannot take certain actions (including assignments or changes of control) without the **prior written consent of the Parent**, which must not be unreasonably withheld.  
- Your clause mirrors this structure but specifically addresses **change of control** as a subset of assignment, with a tailored exception for the common parent entity.  
- Both your clause and the external examples highlight the importance of **consent mechanisms** and the standard of **reasonableness** in withholding/delaying consent.

### Key Takeaways:
- The clause ensures that **changes in ownership or control** are treated as assignments, protecting the non-transferability of the agreement unless consented to.  
- The exception for Reynolds Group Holdings Limited reflects negotiated flexibility for corporate group reorganizations.  
- The language aligns with broader M&A contract norms (as seen in the external MAUD clauses), where consent is a gatekeeper for fundamental changes to contractual relationships.

Change Of Control,a4721ad55b,"In the event a party undergoes a Change of Control Event as defined in Section 14.5, the other party may terminate the Agreement upon thirty (32) days written notice to the party undergoing the Change of Control.","The clause you provided is relevant to the **""Change of Control""** query because it establishes the conditions under which one party can terminate an agreement if the other party experiences a **Change of Control Event** (as defined in Section 14.5 of the agreement). Here’s how it connects to the broader context:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Termination Rights Due to Change of Control**  
   - The clause allows the non-affected party to terminate the agreement if the other party undergoes a **Change of Control Event** (e.g., acquisition, merger, or significant ownership shift).  
   - This is similar to the termination provisions in the external references (e.g., **Section 8.05** in `maud_655`), where termination fees or rights are triggered by acquisition-related events.

2. **Notice Period Comparison**  
   - Your clause requires **32 days' written notice** for termination after a Change of Control.  
   - The external reference (`maud_399`) mentions shorter notice periods (e.g., **4 Business Days** for a Superior Proposal withdrawal), suggesting flexibility based on urgency.  
   - This highlights that termination rights tied to corporate changes can vary in timing and conditions.

3. **Link to Acquisition-Related Triggers**  
   - The external materials discuss **termination fees** and **alternative acquisition agreements** (e.g., `maud_655`), which often accompany Change of Control clauses.  
   - Your clause does not mention fees but focuses on **termination rights**, which could be part of a broader framework where financial consequences (like those in `maud_655`) apply.

4. **Potential Overlap with ""Acquisition Proposal"" Definitions**  
   - The external definition of **""Acquisition Proposal""** (where a 50% ownership threshold applies in `maud_655`) may align with how **""Change of Control Event""** is defined in your agreement (Section 14.5).  
   - If a Change of Control involves an acquisition meeting certain thresholds, similar termination or fee obligations could arise.

### Practical Implications:
- Your clause provides a **unilateral termination right** to the non-affected party, whereas the external examples focus on **mutual termination** or **fee obligations** post-termination.  
- The **32-day notice period** is longer than some deal-specific timelines (e.g., 4 days in `maud_399`), suggesting it may apply to less urgent scenarios or allow for renegotiation.  

### Suggested Considerations:
- If the agreement includes **termination fees** (like in `maud_655`), you may want to cross-reference them with this clause.  
- Clarify whether the **Change of Control Event** definition (Section 14.5) aligns with thresholds like the **50% ownership** rule in the external examples.  

In summary, your clause is a **protective mechanism** against unwanted corporate changes, while the external references show how such events can trigger financial or procedural consequences. Together, they illustrate common contractual responses to **M&A risks**.",5
Anti-Assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates,2c5e257df7,"Except as otherwise provided herein, a Party shall not have the right to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether through a merger, sale of stock, or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party; except that, either Party shall be permitted, without any need for the other Party's consent, to assign this Agreement (a) in whole or in part to an Affiliate (provided, however, that once such Person is no longer an Affiliate of the assigning Party, such former Affiliate shall assign this Agreement back to the assigning Party), provided that the assigning Party provides the other Party notice of any such assignment provided further that failure to provide such notice of such assignment shall not render such assignment void; or (b) to a Third Party in connection with sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assigning Party's business or assets relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether by Change of Control, merger, sale of assets or otherwise; provided, however, that, with respect to clause (b), (i) any assignment of this Agreement shall be void and have no effect unless and until the assignee assumes the <omitted> obligations of the assigning Party in a written instrument, a copy of which is provided to the other Party; and (ii) any assignment of this Agreement must be accompanied by a simultaneous assignment of the Other Agreements to the same assignee, and the assigning Party's interest in the Purchased Assets to the same assignee unless otherwise agreed by Conformis in advance, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.","The query asks for an **anti-assignment clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates** (and not for other types of assignments).

1. **General Anti-Assignment Rule**:  
   - The clause prohibits any assignment of rights or obligations under the agreement without the **prior written consent of the other Party**, unless an exception applies.  

2. **Exception for Affiliates (with Notice Requirement)**:  
   - A Party may assign the agreement **to an Affiliate without consent**, but **must provide notice** to the other Party.  
   - The notice requirement is **only for assignments to Affiliates** (clause (a)), not for assignments under clause (b) (e.g., sale of business/assets).  
   - Importantly, failure to provide notice **does not invalidate the assignment**—it is merely a procedural requirement.  

3. **Other Exceptions (No Notice Required)**:  
   - Assignments to a **Third Party** in connection with a sale of business/assets (clause (b)) are allowed **without notice**, but they require:  
     - The assignee to assume obligations in writing.  
     - Compliance with additional conditions (e.g., simultaneous assignment of related agreements).  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause **explicitly requires notice only for affiliate assignments**, aligning with the query. Assignments under other exceptions (e.g., sale of business) have different conditions but **do not require notice**.  

Thus, this is a valid example of an **anti-assignment clause where notice is mandated solely for affiliate assignments**.",5

2. **Exception for Affiliates (Notice Required)**:  
   - A Party **may assign the agreement to an Affiliate without consent**, but **must provide notice** to the other Party.  
   - The notice requirement is **not a condition for validity** (failure to notify does not void the assignment).  

3. **Other Exceptions (No Notice Required)**:  
   - Assignments to a **Third Party** in connection with a sale of business/assets are also permitted **without notice**, but they require:  
     - The assignee to assume obligations in writing.  
     - Simultaneous assignment of related agreements/assets (unless waived).  

### **Relevance to Query**

Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1.","The query asks for an **anti-assignment clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates**. The provided clause fits this description because it:  

1. **Prohibits General Assignments Without Consent**:  
   - The clause states that neither party can assign the agreement or any interest under it without the **prior written consent of the other party**, unless an exception applies.  

2. **Permits Assignment to Affiliates Without Prior Consent (But Requires Notice)**:  
   - Under **subsection (a)**, a party may assign its rights and obligations to an **Affiliate** without needing prior consent, provided:  
     - The affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations.  
     - The assigning party remains liable.  
   - However, the last sentence imposes a **notice requirement**:  
     > *""Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1.""*  
     - This means that while **prior consent** is not required for affiliate assignments, **notice must still be given afterward**.  

3. **Contrast with Third-Party Assignments**:  
   - Subsection (b) allows assignment to a **Third Party** only in connection with a permitted transfer of the **License Agreement** (implying additional conditions apply).  
   - The notice requirement applies here as well, but the key distinction is that **affiliate assignments are explicitly permitted without prior approval**, whereas third-party assignments are more restricted.  

### Relevance to Query:  
The clause matches the request because it:  
- **Requires notice for affiliate assignments** (but not prior consent).  
- **Strictly prohibits non-affiliate assignments without consent** (unless under specific conditions).

### **Relevance to the Query:**
1. **General Anti-Assignment Restriction**  
   - The clause states that **no Party may assign its rights or obligations under the Agreement without the other Party's prior written consent**, unless an exception applies.  
   - This aligns with the query's focus on restrictions on assignment.

2. **Exception for Affiliates (No Consent Needed, but Notice Required)**  
   - The clause **explicitly permits assignments to Affiliates** without requiring prior consent, as long as:  
     - The affiliate agrees to be bound by the Agreement.  
     - The assigning Party remains liable for obligations.  
   - However, it **requires prompt notice** to the other Party when such an assignment occurs.  
   - This matches the query's requirement of **notice only for affiliate assignments** (rather than consent).  

3. **Other Exceptions (Third-Party Assignments with Conditions)**  
   - The clause also allows assignment to a **Third Party** in connection with a permitted transfer under the **License Agreement**, but this is a separate condition not directly relevant to the query.  

### **Comparison with External References:**  
The external clauses (from MAUD documents) also discuss restrictions on assignments/transfers but **require prior consent** (not just notice) for most actions. In contrast, your clause **only requires notice for affiliate assignments**, making it more permissive in that regard.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause is **directly responsive** to the query because it:  
- **Prohibits assignments without consent** (general rule).  
- **Allows affiliate assignments without consent** but **mandates notice** (specific exception).  
- Does not impose a notice requirement for non-affiliate assignments unless they fall under the License Agreement exception.

### Relevance of the Provided Clause:  
The clause you provided is an **anti-assignment clause with a specific carve-out for affiliates**, but it does **not** explicitly require **only notice** for assignments to affiliates. Instead, it:  
1. **Prohibits assignments** generally unless the assignee assumes the obligations in writing.  
2. **Explicitly restricts Network Affiliate** (likely an affiliate of one of the parties) from assigning or transferring rights **without prior written consent** (not just notice).  
3. Specifies that consent **cannot be unreasonably withheld**.  

### How It Relates to the Query:  
- The clause **does address assignments involving affiliates** (Network Affiliate), but it **requires consent, not just notice**.  
- The query seeks a clause where **notice alone suffices for affiliate assignments**, whereas this clause imposes a stricter **consent requirement**.  

### Suggested Improvement:  
To align with the query, the clause could be revised to say:  
*""Neither party may assign this Agreement without the other party’s prior written consent, except that either party may assign this Agreement to an affiliate upon written notice to the other party, provided that the assignee assumes all obligations hereunder.""*

Revenue/Profit Sharing,b6f92d635c,Revenue Share as specified in this CONTENT DISTRIBUTION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT.<omitted>The revenue share for the Program is stated in Exhibit B.,"The clause you provided pertains to **Revenue/Profit Sharing** by specifying that the revenue share for the program under the **Content Distribution and License Agreement** is detailed in **Exhibit B**.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Direct Reference to Revenue Sharing** – The clause explicitly mentions a ""revenue share,"" which directly addresses the query about how profits or revenues are divided between the parties.  
2. **Incorporation by Reference** – While the exact percentage or structure of the revenue share is not stated in the clause itself, it points to **Exhibit B** for the specific terms, indicating that the financial arrangement is contractually defined elsewhere in the agreement.  
3. **Connection to External Context** – The external references (e.g., termination clauses, competing proposals) may indirectly affect revenue sharing if the agreement is terminated or altered due to a competing transaction. For example:  
   - If the agreement is terminated under **Section 8.3(e)** due to a **Company Competing Proposal**, the revenue-sharing arrangement may cease or be modified.  
   - If an **Acquisition Proposal** (as referenced in **Section 7.3(b)**) leads to a change in control, the revenue-sharing terms in **Exhibit B** could be impacted.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause confirms that revenue sharing is a defined part of the agreement, but its exact mechanics depend on **Exhibit B** and could be influenced by termination or acquisition-related provisions elsewhere in the contract.

     - Net revenue from certain offers (gross revenue minus third-party costs, capped at $0.01 per email).

2. **Exclusions**:
   - Revenue from **Sponsorship tiles** is retained by the party to whom they are allocated (no sharing).
   - Revenue from Untargeted Offers placed **outside** the Co-Branded Application is **not shared equally**.

3. **Variable Revenue Sharing**:
   - Excite@Home pays e-centives a **percentage of net revenue** (redacted, but structured as gross revenue minus purchase price and capped sales costs) from e-centives package sales.
   - If Excite@Home exceeds thresholds for delivering user data records, e-centives pays Excite@Home a **percentage of net revenue** (gross minus third-party commissions) from offers to excess users.

### Relevance to External Information:
While the external clauses (from MAUD documents) focus on **termination fees** tied to competing proposals, they highlight contractual mechanisms for financial adjustments post-termination. In contrast, the provided clause is a **proactive revenue-sharing framework** during the agreement’s term. Both contexts involve:
- **Financial allocations** between parties (revenue sharing vs. termination fees).
- **Triggers for payments** (e.g., revenue generation vs. termination events).
- **Definitions of net/gross revenue** (e.g., deductions for costs).

### Key Takeaway:
The clause answers the query by detailing **how revenue and profits are split** between parties for specific activities, including formulas (e.g., net revenue calculations), exceptions, and performance-based adjustments. Unlike the external examples (which address penalties), this clause governs ongoing collaboration economics.

Revenue/Profit Sharing,ad86c9a9b4,"Net revenue from business operations created by Holding Company for the alliance will be distributed by Holding Company equally - 50/50 - to TKCI and SIC:
SIC's original business concepts and plans, as well as opportunities brought to the table through its connections, and third-party contracts, are ways that we anticipate business could be generated, and revenues created; TKCI's advisory and management services and capital resources will provide the critical structure and business mechanism to carry concepts through to revenue.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about **Revenue/Profit Sharing** as it outlines a specific arrangement for distributing net revenue generated by the Holding Company within the alliance. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Revenue Sharing Mechanism**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that net revenue from business operations created by the Holding Company will be split **equally (50/50)** between **TKCI** and **SIC**. This is a clear example of a revenue/profit-sharing agreement, which is the core focus of the query.

2. **Sources of Revenue Generation**:  
   - The clause identifies the contributions of each party that justify the revenue split:  
     - **SIC** contributes **business concepts, plans, connections, and third-party contracts** to generate revenue.  
     - **TKCI** provides **advisory services, management, and capital resources** to operationalize these concepts.  
   - This delineates how each party’s role ties into the revenue-sharing structure.

3. **Alignment with External Context**:  
   - While the external information provided (e.g., clauses about conducting business ""in the ordinary course"") doesn’t directly address revenue sharing, it underscores the importance of **preserving business relationships** and **operating consistently** during agreements.  
   - Your clause complements this by specifying how revenue from collaborative efforts is handled, ensuring clarity and fairness in the alliance’s financial operations.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause answers the query by **defining the terms of revenue distribution** (50/50 split) and **justifying the split based on each party’s contributions**.  
- It also implicitly highlights the need for **cooperation** (like the external clauses) to ensure revenue-generating activities proceed smoothly.  

If the query seeks to draft or analyze a revenue-sharing provision, this clause serves as a concrete example of how to structure such an agreement, balancing contributions and rewards between parties.

""Hydraspin Share"" means, with respect to Net Revenue, the percentage of Net Revenue that Hydraspin is entitled to receive, as follows: (i) for the first ten (10) Products installed, 92.5% of Net Revenue, and (ii) for the eleventh (11th) Product installed and all Products installed thereafter, 85% of Net Revenue. With respect to each Revenue Event, Distributor shall be entitled to receive the Distributor Share of Net Revenue, and Hydraspin shall be entitled to receive the Hydraspin Share of Net Revenue.","The clause you provided defines **""Distributor Share""** and **""Hydraspin Share""** in the context of **revenue/profit sharing** between a distributor (Distributor) and a company (Hydraspin) based on product installations. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Relevance to Revenue/Profit Sharing:
1. **Structured Revenue Split**:  
   - The clause outlines a tiered revenue-sharing model where the Distributor’s share of **Net Revenue** increases after a threshold (10 products installed):  
     - **First 10 products**: Distributor gets **7.5%**, Hydraspin gets **92.5%**.  
     - **11th product onward**: Distributor’s share jumps to **15%**, Hydraspin’s reduces to **85%**.  
   - This directly addresses how profits/revenue are divided between parties, which is central to a revenue/profit-sharing agreement.

2. **Flexibility for Negotiation**:  
   - The clause allows for **custom agreements** (via separate written contracts) to override the default percentages for specific installations. This shows adaptability in profit-sharing terms, which may be relevant if the query seeks examples of dynamic revenue-sharing structures.

3. **Clear Definitions**:  
   - Terms like **""Net Revenue""**, **""Distributor Share""**, and **""Hydraspin Share""** are explicitly defined, ensuring clarity in how revenue is calculated and allocated—a key aspect of profit-sharing contracts.

### Contrast with External Information:  
The external excerpts discuss **stock conversion ratios** in a merger (e.g., Exchange Ratio for Company Common Stock to Parent Common Stock). While those deal with equity-based transactions, your clause focuses on **operational revenue splits** from product sales. Thus, your clause is more directly applicable to queries about **ongoing revenue distribution** (e.g., between a manufacturer and distributor) rather than one-time merger considerations.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause is a **practical example of a revenue-sharing mechanism** tied to performance milestones (product installations). It could serve as a template for drafting similar agreements where profit splits vary based on predefined thresholds or negotiated terms.

Revenue/Profit Sharing,fc22af5e91,"Commencing with the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 2006 and for each calendar quarter thereafter during the Term, Network shall pay to Affiliate the Affiliate Transactional Share. In consideration of the terms and conditions set forth herein, Network shall pay Affiliate (i) the Affiliate Advertising Share, and (ii) the Affiliate Transactional Share, each as provided in Exhibit D. Except for the Local Advertising and advertising broadcast in Local Programming, Network shall have the exclusive right and authority to sell all of the advertising on the Service and shall share a portion of Network's Advertising Revenue generated from such sales with Affiliate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For purposes hereof, the ""Affiliate Transactional Share"" means fifteen percent (15%) of Network's Transactional Revenue for the pertinent calendar quarter. Commencing with the calendar quarter beginning on April 1, 2006 and for each calendar quarter thereafter during the Term, Network shall pay to Affiliate the Affiliate Advertising Share. For purposes hereof, the ""Affiliate Advertising Share"" shall be determined by multiplying fifteen percent (15%) of Network's Advertising Revenue for such calendar quarter by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households in the DMA(s) of the Station(s) transmitting the Service pursuant to this Agreement, and the denominator of which is the total number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households in all of the DMAs in which Network has a broadcast television station affiliate that is transmitting the Service.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **Revenue/Profit Sharing** as it outlines a detailed revenue-sharing arrangement between **Network** and **Affiliate**. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Revenue/Profit Sharing Mechanisms:
1. **Affiliate Transactional Share**  
   - Network pays Affiliate **15% of Network's Transactional Revenue** for each calendar quarter.  
   - This is a direct profit-sharing mechanism tied to transactional income (e.g., revenue from user transactions, subscriptions, or other defined sources).

2. **Affiliate Advertising Share**  
   - Network shares **15% of its Advertising Revenue**, adjusted by a **subscriber-based formula**:  
     - **Numerator**: Digital Cable Subscriber Households in the Affiliate’s DMA (Designated Market Area).  
     - **Denominator**: Total Digital Cable Subscriber Households across all Network-affiliated DMAs.  
   - This ensures the Affiliate’s share scales with its market reach.

3. **Exclusivity & Revenue Allocation**  
   - Network retains **exclusive rights to sell advertising** on the Service but must share a portion of advertising revenue with Affiliate per agreed terms.  
   - Exceptions (e.g., Local Advertising) are explicitly carved out.

### Relevance to Query:
- The clause **defines specific percentages** (15%) for revenue sharing, addressing how profits are split.  
- It **delineates revenue streams** (Transactional vs. Advertising Revenue) and their respective sharing models.  
- The **timeframe** (quarterly payments starting April 1, 2006) and **calculation methodology** provide clarity on execution.  

### Contrast with External Information:
While the external examples focus on **termination fees tied to acquisition transactions**, your clause governs **ongoing operational revenue sharing**. Both are financial provisions, but:  
- **Your clause**: Active collaboration with recurring payments.  
- **External clauses**: One-time penalties triggered by termination/mergers.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a **proactive revenue-sharing framework** (not a penalty), ensuring Affiliate receives a defined percentage of Network’s transactional and advertising revenues, contingent on performance metrics (subscriber reach). It directly answers the query by detailing **how profits/revenues are shared between parties**.

Minimum Commitment,b51a4e8cc8,INITIAL ORDER COMMITMENT - MA commits to purchase a minimum of 100 Units in aggregate within the Territory within the first six months of term of this Agreement.,"The clause **""INITIAL ORDER COMMITMENT - MA commits to purchase a minimum of 100 Units in aggregate within the Territory within the first six months of term of this Agreement.""** is relevant to the query about **""Minimum Commitment""** in the following ways:  

1. **Definition of Minimum Commitment** – The clause explicitly sets a minimum purchase obligation (100 Units) that MA must fulfill within a specified timeframe (first six months). This aligns with the concept of a ""minimum commitment,"" which typically refers to a contractual obligation to buy, sell, or perform a certain quantity of goods/services within a defined period.  

2. **Enforceability & Consequences** – While the clause does not specify penalties for non-compliance (unlike the external examples, which discuss termination fees), it still establishes a binding obligation. If MA fails to meet this commitment, it could lead to:  
   - Breach of contract claims.  
   - Potential termination or renegotiation of the agreement.  
   - Financial penalties (if implied or stated elsewhere in the contract).  

3. **Comparison to External Examples** – The external references discuss **termination fees** tied to acquisition-related events, which are triggered if certain conditions (e.g., a sale agreement within 12 months) are met. Similarly, the **minimum commitment clause** could be tied to consequences (e.g., fees, contract adjustments) if the 100-unit threshold is not met.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause directly addresses the query by defining a **minimum purchase commitment** (100 Units) with a clear timeframe (6 months). While it lacks explicit penalties, its relevance lies in establishing a measurable obligation that could trigger remedies if breached. For a complete analysis, other sections of the agreement (e.g., termination, remedies) should be reviewed to determine enforcement mechanisms.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause Related to Minimum Commitment:
1. **Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment**:
   - Ginkgo is contractually obligated to make **Development Purchases** and **Production Purchases** from BLI in specified amounts for each **Contract Year**, as detailed in **Table 7.2.2**.
   - The clause sets binding minimum purchase targets (e.g., $150 million total over 7 years) and specifies adjustments based on performance milestones (e.g., if BLI completes certain workflows, the total commitment increases to $150 million).

2. **Enforcement and Remedies**:
   - If Ginkgo fails to meet the **Minimum Cumulative Purchase Commitment** for a Contract Year, BLI may provide written notice, and certain restrictions (e.g., non-compete obligations) may terminate.
   - Ginkgo can **reduce** the Minimum Commitment if BLI materially breaches its supply obligations (instead of terminating the agreement), subject to mutual agreement.

3. **Termination Implications**:
   - The clause ties the Minimum Commitment to termination rights (e.g., under **Section 13.2.1** for material breach). If Ginkgo chooses not to terminate, it may negotiate a reduction in future purchase commitments.
   - Specific conditions (e.g., BLI completing workflows) can trigger changes to the total commitment amount.

4. **External Context**:
   - While the external information provided discusses **termination fees** in acquisition scenarios (unrelated to purchase commitments), the clause here focuses on **ongoing performance obligations** and **remedies for non-compliance** with minimum purchase requirements.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause directly addresses **how minimum purchase commitments are structured**, enforced, and adjusted, which is the core of the query.
- It highlights consequences for failing to meet commitments (e.g., loss of exclusivity) and flexibility in case of breaches.
- The **financial and operational binding nature** of the commitments is emphasized (e.g., ""$150 million total obligation"").

### Conclusion:
This clause is **central** to understanding the ""Minimum Commitment"" query, as it defines the contractual obligations, remedies, and conditions tied to Ginkgo’s purchase commitments. The external information about termination fees, while useful for other contexts, does not directly apply here. Instead, the focus is on **performance-based minimums** and **breach-related adjustments**.

""Business Entity Minimum Monthly Commitment"" means, for each Business Entity, a minimum monthly commitment of at least 250 Users, by Channel Partner for each Business Entity.","The clause provided is relevant to the query about **""Minimum Commitment""** in the following ways:

1. **Definition of Minimum Commitment**:  
   The clause explicitly defines the **""Business Entity Minimum Monthly Commitment""** as a requirement for the Channel Partner to commit to at least **250 Users per Business Entity** each month. This establishes a baseline obligation for the Channel Partner regarding user volume.

2. **Contingency for Special Pricing**:  
   The clause states that **""Special Pricing""** is contingent on a **minimum order size of [***] users**, implying that discounted or preferential pricing terms are only valid if the Channel Partner meets or exceeds the specified user threshold. This ties financial incentives to the fulfillment of minimum commitments.

3. **Structural Obligations**:  
   The clause also mandates that the Channel Partner maintain **at least one (1) web page** describing the iPass Services, which is a non-financial but related commitment supporting the service offering.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
While the external information provided discusses a **termination fee** related to acquisition proposals (which is a different context), the clause directly addresses the **minimum commitment** question by:  
- Defining quantitative thresholds (250 Users per Business Entity).  
- Linking pricing benefits to meeting these thresholds.  
- Outlining ancillary obligations (web page requirement) that support the broader commitment framework.  

Thus, the clause is a clear example of how **minimum commitments** are structured in contracts, particularly in channel partner agreements where volume-based pricing and performance obligations are common.

Reseller must have a minimum of five (5) of its sales staff participate in the sales and marketing training in the first 6 months of this agreement.","The clause provided outlines a **Minimum Sell-Through Commitment** in a contract between HSNS and E.piphany, which is directly relevant to the query about **""Minimum Commitment""**. Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

1. **Definition of Minimum Commitment**:  
   The clause specifies that HSNS must guarantee a minimum revenue commitment of **$750,000 over three years** (""Minimum Sell-Through Commitment""). This is a contractual obligation to ensure a baseline performance or financial contribution from HSNS.

2. **Structured Payment Schedule**:  
   The commitment is broken down into **annual and quarterly minimum payments**, with specific amounts for each year (e.g., Year 3 includes a variable component tied to email volume). This structure ensures the commitment is met incrementally.

3. **Performance-Linked Adjustments**:  
   The Year 3 payment includes a **variable increase** (50% of the growth in emails sent between Year 1 and Year 2), capped at $500,000. This ties the minimum commitment to actual performance metrics, balancing guaranteed revenue with incentives for growth.

4. **Non-Financial Commitments**:  
   The clause also includes **training requirements** (e.g., pre-sales and sales staff participation), which are ancillary minimum commitments to ensure HSNS meets operational standards. These reinforce the broader ""commitment"" framework beyond just financial terms.

### Relevance to External Information:  
While the external excerpts discuss a **termination fee** (a post-termination financial obligation), the provided clause focuses on **ongoing performance commitments** during the agreement term. Both, however, exemplify contractual mechanisms to enforce minimum obligations:  
- The termination fee acts as a penalty for certain post-termination actions.  
- The sell-through commitment ensures active performance during the term.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause defines a **minimum financial and operational threshold** HSNS must meet, addressing the query by illustrating how ""minimum commitment"" can be structured in contracts (e.g., fixed/variable payments, training mandates). Unlike the termination fee (a reactive measure), this is a **proactive performance guarantee**.",5

Here’s the breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Minimum Commitment Requirement**:  
   - The clause specifies that the Investor must maintain **committed capital of at least $5,000,000**, adjusted for any **Required Capital Contributions** already made.  
   - This creates a contractual ""floor"" for the Investor’s financial commitment, ensuring they retain sufficient capital to meet obligations under the agreement.

2. **Consequences of Non-Compliance**:  
   - Failure to meet this minimum commitment constitutes a **""Maintenance Event of Default""**, which could trigger remedies (e.g., termination, penalties) under the agreement.  
   - This ties the financial commitment directly to the enforceability of the contract, similar to how **material adverse effect (MAE)** clauses in the external excerpts condition obligations on financial or operational integrity.

3. **Verification Mechanism**:  
   - The Investor must provide **sworn affidavits or other evidence** to prove compliance upon request.  
   - This aligns with the external excerpts’ emphasis on **representations and warranties** (e.g., Sections 5.3, 5.9) being ""true and correct,"" as both clauses require ongoing factual accuracy and documentation.

### Connection to External Context:  
While the external excerpts focus on **representations/warranties** and **MAE standards** in a merger agreement, the queried clause serves a parallel purpose in a financing context:  
- Both enforce **minimum financial thresholds** (e.g., $5M capital vs. debt limits in Section 5.3(i)).  
- Both include **reporting obligations** (affidavits here; disclosure schedules in the excerpts).  
- Both treat breaches as **defaults/conditions to closing**, ensuring parties meet baseline commitments.  

In summary, the clause operationalizes the ""Minimum Commitment"" query by defining a specific financial obligation, its enforcement mechanism, and the repercussions for non-compliance—mirroring the structural logic of the external merger conditions.",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,838dcfbc11,"Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may transfer or assign its rights under this IP Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, on condition that it provides the <omitted> other Party with notice of the transfer or assignment.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer** because it specifically addresses the conditions under which a party may transfer or assign its intellectual property (IP) rights under the agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Permissible Transfers/Assignments**:  
   - The clause allows a party to transfer or assign its rights under the IP Agreement **only in specific circumstances**:  
     - A **merger**,  
     - An **acquisition**, or  
     - A **sale of all or substantially all of its assets**.  
   - This ensures that IP rights cannot be arbitrarily transferred but are tied to significant corporate transactions.

2. **Condition for Transfer**:  
   - The transferring party must **provide notice** to the other party.  
   - This ensures transparency and allows the non-transferring party to be aware of changes in ownership or control of the IP rights.

### Connection to the Query:
- The clause directly governs **how IP ownership can be assigned or transferred**, which is the core of the query.  
- It aligns with the broader contractual framework (as seen in the external information), where:  
  - **Specific performance and equitable relief** (Section 8.5) may apply if a party breaches transfer conditions.  
  - **Reasonable best efforts** (maud_892) are required to consummate transactions, which could include IP transfers in mergers/acquisitions.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Protects IP Integrity**: Restricts transfers to major corporate events, preventing fragmentation or unauthorized assignments.  
- **Ensures Compliance**: The notice requirement aligns with the agreement’s emphasis on specific performance (Section 8.5) and cooperation (maud_892).  

In summary, this clause is a **critical component** of the IP Agreement, defining the scope and conditions for transferring IP rights while linking to broader enforcement and transactional mechanisms in the contract.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Fallback Mechanism for IP Assignment**  
   - The clause anticipates situations where local laws (""as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction"") may block the outright assignment of ownership/title in the Assigned IP under **Section 2.1(b)(i)**.  
   - It ensures the transaction isn’t derailed by such legal limitations by providing alternative mechanisms to transfer value and control of the IP.

2. **Partial Assignment + License for Residual Rights**  
   - **Subsection (A)**: Requires the Seller to assign **all assignable rights** (e.g., economic/commercialization rights) to the Purchaser, even if full ownership cannot be transferred.  
   - **Subsection (B)**: For non-assignable rights, the Seller grants a **broad, exclusive, perpetual license** to the Purchaser, effectively mirroring ownership benefits (e.g., exclusivity, sublicensing, global use).  

3. **Protection for the Purchaser**  
   - The license terms are intentionally expansive (irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up) to ensure the Purchaser can fully exploit the IP without ongoing dependency on the Seller.  
   - This mitigates the risk of the Seller retaining leverage over the IP due to jurisdictional legal quirks.

### Connection to External Context:  
The external excerpts highlight contractual provisions for **specific performance** and **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) to enforce IP-related obligations. This clause aligns with that framework by:  
- **Preempting breaches**: It ensures the Seller cannot use legal barriers as an excuse to withhold IP rights.  
- **Enabling enforcement**: If the Seller fails to comply, the Purchaser could seek injunctive relief (as noted in *Section 8.5* and *10.12*) to compel assignment/license execution.  

### Why It Matters for the Query:  
This clause is a **risk-mitigation tool** for IP transfers, ensuring the Purchaser receives either ownership or equivalent control over the IP, even in restrictive jurisdictions. It reflects best practices in M&A/asset purchase agreements to avoid gaps in IP ownership that could undermine the transaction’s value.  

**Practical Impact**: Without this clause, the Purchaser might face unresolved IP rights in certain jurisdictions, leading to disputes or loss of commercial opportunities. The license acts as a ""safety net"" to preserve the deal’s intent.",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,b482fa8daf,"This IP Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but will not be assignable or delegable by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any attempted transfer in contravention of this Section 9.3 shall be null and void.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer** because it governs the conditions under which the rights and obligations under the IP Agreement can be assigned or delegated to another party. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Binding Effect & Successors**  
   - The agreement binds the original parties and extends to their **successors and permitted assigns**, ensuring continuity of obligations and rights even if ownership or control changes (e.g., through mergers or acquisitions).

2. **Restriction on Assignment/Delegation**  
   - A party cannot **assign or delegate** its rights/duties under the agreement **without prior written consent** from the other party. This protects both parties from unwanted transfers of IP ownership or control to third parties (e.g., competitors or unqualified entities).

3. **Consequences of Unauthorized Transfer**  
   - Any attempted transfer **without consent** is declared **null and void**, meaning it has no legal effect. This reinforces the enforceability of the restriction and deters unilateral actions.

### Connection to the Query:
- **IP Ownership Control**: The clause ensures that IP rights remain with the original parties unless both agree to a transfer, safeguarding strategic interests (e.g., preventing a competitor from gaining IP through an unauthorized assignment).  
- **Alignment with External Context**: The external excerpts highlight the importance of **specific performance** and **injunctions** to enforce agreement terms. If a party violates this clause by attempting an unauthorized transfer, the injured party could seek equitable remedies (e.g., court orders to block the transfer) under the broader agreement’s enforcement framework.  
- **Risk Mitigation**: By making non-compliant transfers void, the clause reduces litigation risks over disputed IP ownership, as the agreement itself invalidates such actions.

### Practical Implications:
- **Due Diligence**: In mergers/acquisitions, parties must check for such clauses to ensure IP transfers are properly consented to.  
- **Drafting Considerations**: The clause could be linked to broader **boilerplate provisions** (like those in the external excerpts) to ensure enforceability through injunctive relief.

In summary, this clause directly addresses **IP ownership transferability** by imposing strict consent requirements and legal consequences for non-compliance, which is central to the query.",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,064fcaf0c7,"If a Seller Party assigns or transfers any Licensed IP, the Seller shall (or shall cause the applicable Seller Party to) expressly condition such assignment or transfer on the express acknowledgement and agreement of the assignee or transferee that all such Licensed IP is bound by the license grants set forth herein. If Purchaser or a Purchaser Assignee assigns or transfers any Intellectual Property licensed to the Seller Parties pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(d), the Purchaser shall (or shall cause the applicable Purchaser Assignee to) expressly condition such assignment or transfer on the express acknowledgement and agreement of the assignee or transferee that all such Intellectual Property is bound by such license grants. Neither party may assign (whether by operation of law or otherwise) this IP Agreement, or any of its licenses, rights, privileges or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such attempted assignment shall be void; provided, however, that, following the Initial Closing Date, without any such prior written consent but upon prior written notice to the other party, each party may assign this IP Agreement to: (i) an Affiliate; (ii) a lender for collateral security; (iii) a Person that succeeds to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this IP Agreement relates in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this IP Agreement relates; or (iv) corporate reorganization of the party in which the ultimate ownership of the party immediately prior to such reorganization is the same as the ultimate ownership of the party immediately after such reorganization.","This clause is highly relevant to the query about **IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer** as it establishes clear rules and conditions governing how intellectual property (IP) can be assigned or transferred between the parties (Seller Parties and Purchaser/Purchaser Assignee) under the agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Conditional Assignment/Transfer of Licensed IP**:  
   - If a **Seller Party** assigns or transfers any **Licensed IP**, the Seller must ensure the assignee/transferee acknowledges that the IP remains bound by the license grants in the agreement.  
   - Similarly, if the **Purchaser** assigns IP licensed to Seller Parties, the Purchaser must ensure the assignee agrees to uphold those licenses.  
   - *Relevance*: This prevents parties from circumventing license obligations by transferring IP to third parties without their consent to the existing terms.

2. **Restrictions on Assignment of the Agreement**:  
   - Neither party can assign the **entire IP Agreement** (or its licenses/rights) without the other party’s prior written consent. Any unauthorized assignment is void.  
   - *Relevance*: Protects both parties from unwanted transfers of contractual rights/obligations to unrelated entities.

3. **Permitted Assignments (Exceptions)**:  
   Even without consent, assignments are allowed in specific scenarios (e.g., to an **Affiliate**, lender for collateral, successor in a merger/sale, or corporate reorganization with unchanged ultimate ownership).  
   - *Relevance*: Provides flexibility for legitimate business restructuring while safeguarding the other party’s interests through prior notice requirements.

### Connection to External Information:  
- The clause aligns with the broader contractual principles in the provided excerpts:  
  - **Specific Performance/Equitable Relief** (from *maud_102*): If a party breaches the assignment conditions (e.g., transfers IP without ensuring licensee rights), the injured party could seek injunctive relief to enforce compliance.  
  - **Prior Consent Requirements** (from *maud_65*): Similar to restrictions on unilateral actions by the Company without Parent’s consent, this clause limits assignments without mutual agreement.  

### Why It Matters for IP Ownership Transfer:  
This clause ensures that:  
- IP licenses survive transfers, protecting licensee rights.  
- Unauthorized assignments are invalid, maintaining control over contractual relationships.  
- Legitimate business needs (e.g., mergers) are accommodated without undermining the agreement’s purpose.  

In summary, it balances flexibility for corporate transactions with strict safeguards to preserve IP licensing frameworks.",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,911509cfdb,"To the extent that the Company IP does not vest automatically in the Company the Executive hereby assigns all right, title and interest in the Company IP to the Company with full title guarantee by way of a present assignment of all future rights and shall otherwise hold them on trust for the Company.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about **IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer** because it explicitly addresses the transfer of intellectual property (IP) rights from the Executive to the Company. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Assignment of IP Rights**:  
   - The clause ensures that any IP created by the Executive (referred to as ""Company IP"") that does not automatically vest in the Company (e.g., under default employment law rules) is formally assigned to the Company.  
   - The Executive transfers **all right, title, and interest** in the IP, effectively relinquishing any ownership claims.

2. **Present Assignment of Future Rights**:  
   - The clause includes a **present assignment of future rights**, meaning any IP the Executive creates in the future (during employment or as part of their duties) is also assigned to the Company upfront, avoiding disputes later.

3. **Trust Mechanism**:  
   - If the IP does not immediately vest in the Company, the Executive agrees to **hold it on trust** for the Company, ensuring the Company retains equitable ownership even before formal legal transfer.

### Connection to the Query:
- The clause is a **standard IP ownership transfer provision** in employment or contractor agreements, ensuring the Company secures full ownership of IP created by the Executive.  
- It complements the broader context of the external information provided (e.g., obligations to conduct business ""in the ordinary course"" or restrictions on actions without Parent consent). For example:  
  - If the Company is undergoing a merger (implied by references to ""Effective Time"" and ""Parent"" in the external text), this clause ensures IP ownership is clearly transferred to the Company, avoiding ambiguities that could disrupt the transaction.  
  - It aligns with the requirement to avoid actions outside the ""ordinary course of business"" (external text, Page 38) by securing IP rights proactively.  

### Why It Matters:
- **Legal Clarity**: Prevents disputes over IP ownership, which is critical in mergers/acquisitions (implied in the external text).  
- **Compliance**: Ensures the Company meets obligations to third parties (e.g., ""Parent"" approval requirements) by maintaining clear IP ownership.  
- **Risk Mitigation**: The ""trust"" provision safeguards the Company if formal assignment is delayed.  

In summary, this clause is a **proactive measure to transfer and protect IP rights**, which is essential for the Company’s operations and any transactional context (like a merger, as hinted in the external information).",5
Joint IP Ownership,ae6340432d,"In the event that any Development IP is jointly invented by the Parties in accordance with applicable intellectual property laws, then the ownership of such Development IP that has been jointly invented shall be co-owned by the Parties in accordance with such applicable intellectual property laws; provided, however, that neither Party shall have any duty or obligation to account to the other for any use or exploitation of such jointly invented Development IP and as between the Parties, each Party shall be entitled to retain any and all benefit, financial or otherwise, derived by such Party from such jointly invented Development IP.","The clause provided is directly relevant to the query on **Joint IP Ownership** as it establishes the framework for how jointly invented intellectual property (Development IP) will be owned and managed between the parties. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Joint Ownership**:  
   - The clause confirms that if Development IP is jointly invented by the parties under applicable IP laws, it will be **co-owned** by them. This aligns with standard joint ownership principles in IP law (e.g., under U.S. law, joint inventors are presumed to hold equal, undivided rights unless otherwise agreed).

2. **No Accounting or Sharing Obligations**:  
   - A critical provision states that neither party is required to account to the other for **use or exploitation** of the jointly owned IP. This means:  
     - Each party can **independently** use, license, or commercialize the IP without sharing revenue or profits with the other.  
     - This avoids the complexities of profit-sharing or royalty arrangements typical in some joint ownership agreements.  

3. **Retention of Benefits**:  
   - Each party is entitled to retain **all benefits** (financial or otherwise) derived from its use of the jointly invented IP. This reinforces the autonomy granted to each co-owner and reduces potential disputes over exploitation rights.  

### Connection to the Query:  
- The clause addresses the core issue of **how joint IP ownership is structured** in the agreement, clarifying:  
  - **Rights**: Co-ownership is automatic for jointly invented IP.  
  - **Freedoms**: Parties can exploit the IP without restrictions or obligations to the other.  
  - **Legal Defaults**: It modifies default joint ownership rules (e.g., under U.S. patent law, joint owners must account to each other unless contracted otherwise).  

### Relation to External Information:  
While the external excerpts focus on **enforcement** (e.g., injunctive relief for breaches), the joint IP clause complements them by:  
- Defining the **substantive rights** (ownership and exploitation) that would be protected through enforcement mechanisms.  
- Implicitly relying on the broader agreement’s dispute resolution framework (e.g., Delaware courts) if conflicts arise over IP ownership or use.  

### Why This Matters:  
This clause is **pro-business** for collaborative ventures, as it:  
- Encourages innovation by simplifying IP ownership.  
- Reduces administrative burdens (no tracking or sharing of profits).  
- Aligns with the agreement’s emphasis on **specific performance** (external excerpts) by clearly defining IP rights upfront, minimizing breaches.  

In summary, the clause directly answers the query by outlining a pragmatic, litigation-averse approach to joint IP ownership.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Joint Ownership of IP**:  
   - The clause establishes that all rights, title, and interest in the ""Joint IP"" (defined as Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP) are owned jointly by the Parties. This directly addresses the query by defining the scope and nature of joint ownership.

2. **Assignment of Ownership**:  
   - Each Party agrees to assign (or ensure assignment by its employees/agents) an undivided one-half interest in the Joint IP to the other Party. This ensures that both Parties have equal legal rights to the IP, which is a critical aspect of joint ownership.

3. **Mechanisms to Perfect Ownership**:  
   - The clause includes practical steps to formalize joint ownership, such as requiring employees/consultants to execute assignments and documentation to ""perfect"" the other Party's half-interest. This aligns with the external information provided, which emphasizes obtaining necessary consents/approvals (e.g., permits, filings) to consummate transactions.

4. **Usage and Licensing Rights**:  
   - The clause grants each Party broad rights to use the Joint IP freely or license it to Third Parties, subject to field-specific restrictions (e.g., ""Buyer Field"" for Stryker). This reflects the flexibility and limitations typical in joint IP arrangements.  
   - The reference to Section 4.3(c) of the APA (Asset Purchase Agreement) indicates that external licensing may involve additional terms, tying back to the need for compliance with broader contractual obligations (similar to the external information's focus on adhering to permits/consents).

### Connection to External Information:  
The external excerpts highlight the Parties' obligations to cooperate and use ""reasonable best efforts"" to obtain permits/approvals for transactions. This mirrors the clause's requirements for:  
- Executing assignments/documentation to perfect IP ownership (a form of ""necessary documentation"").  
- Ensuring compliance with legal/regulatory steps (e.g., assignments by employees) to solidify joint ownership.  

Thus, the clause operationalizes the broader principle of cooperation (mentioned in the external info) in the specific context of Joint IP ownership.

### Summary:  
This clause is a **detailed framework for joint IP ownership**, covering:  
- Equal ownership rights.  
- Assignment mechanisms to formalize ownership.  
- Usage/licensing permissions.  
- Alignment with broader transactional compliance (as seen in the external info).  

It directly answers the query by showing how joint IP ownership is structured, enforced, and integrated into the Parties' obligations.",5
Joint IP Ownership,a1b6f59589,"Investor shall own all right, title and interest in any Improvement made jointly by Company and Investor (""Joint Improvements"") during the term of this IP Agreement, and Company agrees to and hereby does assign to Investor any right, title and interest it may otherwise have in any Joint Improvement.","The clause you provided addresses **joint IP ownership** by explicitly allocating all rights, title, and interest in **Joint Improvements** (defined as improvements made collaboratively by the Company and Investor) solely to the **Investor**. Here’s how it relates to the query and the external context:

### Relevance to Joint IP Ownership:
1. **Assignment of Rights**:  
   - The clause ensures that the **Company irrevocably assigns** its potential ownership stake in Joint Improvements to the Investor. This eliminates ambiguity about joint ownership, vesting full control in the Investor.  
   - This is a **one-sided ownership structure**, differing from traditional joint ownership where rights might be shared or require mutual consent for exploitation.

2. **Contrast with External Context**:  
   - The external excerpts discuss **specific performance** (equitable remedies for breach, like injunctions to enforce contractual obligations). While not directly about IP, they highlight how contracts prioritize enforceability of terms—similar to how this clause’s assignment provision would be strictly enforced.  
   - If the Company breached by retaining IP rights, the Investor could seek **specific performance** (per the external examples) to compel assignment, as monetary damages might not suffice for unique IP assets.

3. **Implications for Collaboration**:  
   - The clause discourages disputes over joint creations by preemptively transferring rights. This aligns with the external emphasis on avoiding irreparable harm (e.g., breaches threatening deal consummation).  
   - Unlike the merger-focused external clauses, this IP clause is **proactive**—preventing conflicts rather than remedying them.

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause is a **clear, preemptive mechanism** to avoid joint ownership complexities by vesting IP rights solely in the Investor. Its enforceability would likely mirror the equitable principles (e.g., specific performance) emphasized in the external context, ensuring the Investor’s exclusive control over Joint Improvements.",5
Joint IP Ownership,bd7fd1b70e,"All right, title and interest in and to the Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP (""Joint IP"") shall be owned jointly by the Parties.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Joint Ownership of IP**:  
   - The clause establishes that all rights, title, and interest in the ""Joint IP"" (defined as Improved Conformis Background IP and KIB Product IP) are owned jointly by the Parties. This directly addresses the core of the query by defining the scope and nature of joint ownership.

2. **Assignment of Rights**:  
   - Each Party agrees to assign (or ensure assignment by its employees/agents) an undivided one-half interest in the Joint IP to the other Party. This ensures that both Parties have equal legal ownership, which is a critical aspect of joint IP arrangements.

3. **Mechanisms to Perfect Ownership**:  
   - The clause includes practical steps to formalize joint ownership, such as requiring employees/consultants to execute assignments and documentation to ""perfect"" the other Party’s half-interest. This aligns with the external information’s emphasis on obtaining necessary approvals/consents (e.g., ""reasonable best efforts to obtain permits, consents, approvals"" in the external snippets).

4. **Usage and Licensing Rights**:  
   - It specifies how each Party may use or license the Joint IP without needing consent from the other Party, subject to field-specific restrictions (e.g., Conformis licensing outside the ""Buyer Field,"" Stryker licensing within it). This clarifies the operational flexibility under joint ownership.

5. **Third-Party Licenses**:  
   - External licenses to Third Parties are addressed, with certain conditions (e.g., compliance with Section 4.3(c) of the APA). This ties to the external information’s focus on third-party approvals and legal compliance.

### Connection to External Information:
The external snippets highlight the importance of using ""reasonable best efforts"" to secure permits, consents, and approvals from third parties or governmental entities. The Joint IP clause complements this by:  
- Requiring Parties to take proactive steps (e.g., executing assignments) to ensure joint ownership is legally enforceable.  
- Addressing third-party interactions (e.g., licensing) in a way that aligns with broader contractual obligations to obtain approvals.  

### Why It’s Relevant:
The clause provides a **detailed framework** for joint IP ownership, covering:  
- **Legal ownership** (equal undivided interests).  
- **Procedural safeguards** (assignments, documentation).  
- **Operational rights** (usage, licensing).  
- **Third-party implications** (licensing terms).  

This directly answers the query by showing how joint IP ownership is structured, enforced, and operationalized in the agreement, while also reflecting broader themes (e.g., compliance, third-party approvals) from the external context.",5
Joint IP Ownership,44a4eb704c,"Neither party may assign (whether by operation of law or otherwise) this IP Agreement, or any of its licenses, rights, privileges or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such attempted assignment shall be void; provided, however, that, following the Initial Closing Date, without any such prior written consent but upon prior written notice to the other party, each party may assign this IP Agreement to: (i) an Affiliate; (ii) a lender for collateral security; (iii) a Person that succeeds to all or substantially all of its business or assets to which this IP Agreement relates in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this IP Agreement relates; or (iv) corporate reorganization of the party in which the ultimate ownership of the party immediately prior to such reorganization is the same as the ultimate ownership of the party immediately after such reorganization.","The clause you provided is relevant to the **Joint IP Ownership** query in the context of **assignment and transfer of intellectual property (IP) rights** under the agreement. Here's how it connects:

### Key Relevance to Joint IP Ownership:
1. **Restriction on Assignment Without Consent**:  
   - The clause states that neither party can assign the IP Agreement (including licenses, rights, or obligations) without the **prior written consent** of the other party.  
   - This ensures that joint ownership of IP remains controlled and that one party cannot unilaterally transfer its rights to a third party, which could disrupt the balance of ownership or create conflicts.

2. **Exceptions Where Assignment is Permitted**:  
   - Even in a joint ownership scenario, the clause allows assignment in specific cases (e.g., to an Affiliate, lender, successor entity, or in a corporate reorganization) **without consent but with prior notice**.  
   - These exceptions are structured to accommodate business needs (e.g., mergers, financing) while still protecting the other party’s interests by requiring transparency (notice).

3. **Alignment with External Clauses**:  
   - The external references (e.g., from the Company Disclosure Schedule) emphasize that actions affecting IP or agreements require consent unless an exception applies (e.g., as ""expressly permitted"" or ""required by Law"").  
   - Similarly, your clause ensures that assignments—which could impact joint IP ownership—are either consented to or fall under predefined exceptions.

### Why This Matters for Joint IP Ownership:
- **Control Over IP**: Prevents one party from undermining the joint ownership structure by transferring rights to an undesirable third party.  
- **Flexibility for Legitimate Business Needs**: Allows for assignments in cases like corporate restructuring without unnecessary barriers.  
- **Consistency with Broader Agreement Terms**: Mirrors the principle in the external clauses that restrictions on IP-related actions are subject to reasonable consent requirements.  

In summary, this clause safeguards the integrity of joint IP ownership by balancing restrictions on assignments with pragmatic exceptions, ensuring neither party is unfairly disadvantaged.",5
License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,0171ecf8a0,"For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor also grants to Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license for continued use of the Licensed Mark for the production and sale of inventory containing the Licensed Mark applied to such products during the Transition Period as set forth in section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and in Schedule 2 of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any of the licenses granted by the terms of this Agreement include any right to sublicense, such right to sublicense shall extend to Licensee's subsidiaries and joint venturers.","The query seeks a **license clause covering affiliates of the licensor and/or licensee**, and the provided clause explicitly addresses this by:  

1. **Covering Affiliates of the Licensee**:  
   - The clause grants a license not only to the **Licensee** but also to its **subsidiaries and affiliates**, ensuring the rights extend to the broader corporate group.  
   - It further clarifies that **sublicensing rights** (if applicable under the agreement) also extend to **subsidiaries and joint venturers**, reinforcing coverage for affiliated entities.  

2. **Scope of License**:  
   - The license is **non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free**, with a defined purpose (use of the Licensed Mark for inventory production/sale during the Transition Period).  
   - This ensures affiliates of the Licensee can operate under the same terms without separate agreements.  

3. **Linkage to External Agreements**:  
   - The clause references the **Separation and Distribution Agreement (Section 8.2)** and **Schedule 2**, which may contain further details on affiliate rights or restrictions.  

### Relevance to Query:  
The clause directly answers the query by:  
- Explicitly including **subsidiaries and affiliates** of the Licensee in the license grant.  
- Extending sublicensing rights to **joint venturers** (a type of affiliate).  
- Avoiding ambiguity with ""for the avoidance of doubt"" language, which is critical in contracts involving multi-entity structures.  

### Contrast with External References:  
The external examples (from MAUD) focus on **restrictions** imposed on a company and its subsidiaries (e.g., requiring consent for certain actions). In contrast, the provided clause is **permissive**, granting rights to affiliates. Both types of clauses are common in licensing/merger contexts but serve opposite purposes.  

**Key Takeaway**: This clause is a clear example of how a license agreement can explicitly extend rights to affiliates, ensuring legal coverage across a corporate group.",5
License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,eeae5344aa,"For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor also grants to Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide royalty-free license for continued use of the Licensed Mark for the production and sale of inventory containing the Licensed Mark applied to such products during the Transition Period as set forth in section 8.2 of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and in Schedule 2 of this Agreement.<omitted>For avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any of the licenses granted by the terms of this Agreement include any right to sublicense, such right to sublicense shall extend to Licensee's subsidiaries and joint venturers.","The query seeks a license clause that covers affiliates of both the licensor and licensee. The provided clause is highly relevant because it explicitly addresses the licensee's affiliates (subsidiaries and joint venturers) in the context of licensing rights. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

1. **Coverage of Licensee's Affiliates**:  
   - The clause grants a license not only to the **Licensee** but also extends it to its **subsidiaries and affiliates** (e.g., ""Licensee and its subsidiaries and affiliates"").  
   - It further clarifies that sublicensing rights (if applicable) also extend to **subsidiaries and joint venturers**, ensuring broader coverage of the licensee’s corporate family.  

2. **Scope of Rights**:  
   - The license is **non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free**, with specific permissions for continued use of the Licensed Mark during a defined **Transition Period**.  
   - This mirrors the external examples (e.g., obligations to ""cause Subsidiaries to"" act in the ordinary course), but here it focuses on **rights** rather than restrictions.  

3. **Avoidance of Ambiguity**:  
   - The clause uses ""for the avoidance of doubt"" to explicitly confirm that affiliates are included, similar to how the external examples emphasize prior consent requirements for subsidiaries.  

### Key Relevance:  
The clause directly answers the query by detailing how affiliates of the **Licensee** (not the Licensor) are treated under the license. While it doesn’t address the Licensor’s affiliates, it provides a clear template for extending rights to the licensee’s corporate group, which could be adapted reciprocally for the licensor’s affiliates if needed.  

For a comprehensive clause covering **both parties' affiliates**, you might combine this language with obligations like those in the external examples (e.g., ""shall cause its Subsidiaries to comply"").",4

### Key Aspects Addressing the Query:
1. **Assignment to Affiliates/Subsidiaries**:
   - The clause permits the **Licensee** to assign its rights/obligations to its affiliates or subsidiaries, but **only with the Licensor's prior written consent** (subsection (i)).
   - The **Licensor**, however, has broader rights: it may assign its rights/obligations to its affiliates or subsidiaries **without the Licensee's approval** (subsection (ii)). This creates an asymmetry favoring the Licensor.

2. **Assignment in Business Transfers**:
   - Both parties may assign the Agreement **to a purchaser of substantially all of their business/assets** (or to an affiliate) without the other party’s consent. This ensures flexibility in mergers, acquisitions, or reorganizations involving affiliates.

3. **Sublicensing Restrictions**:
   - The Licensee is generally prohibited from sublicensing its rights under **Section 2(a)** without the Licensor’s consent (which cannot be unreasonably withheld/delayed). However, it allows sublicensing to third parties in the **ordinary course of business** with prior notice to the Licensor. This balances control with operational practicality.

4. **Affiliate-Specific Flexibility**:
   - The clause distinguishes between assignments to **affiliates** (permitted under certain conditions) and assignments to **third parties** (strictly prohibited without consent). This aligns with the query’s focus on affiliates.

### Connection to External Information:
The external examples (e.g., MAUD clauses) emphasize restrictions on actions by a company and its subsidiaries without prior consent, mirroring the structure of your clause. For instance:
- Both your clause and the MAUD excerpts require **written consent** for certain actions (e.g., assignments, sublicensing).
- They include exceptions for affiliates/subsidiaries (e.g., Licensor’s unilateral right to assign to affiliates in your clause vs. MAUD’s carve-outs for permitted actions).

### Why This Matters:
This clause is critical for defining:
- **Control**: How affiliates/subsidiaries can engage under the Agreement.
- **Risk Allocation**: Protects parties from unwanted third-party involvement while allowing reasonable flexibility for corporate restructuring.
- **Compliance**: Ensures assignments/sublicensing comply with negotiated terms (e.g., Licensor’s consent for Licensee’s affiliates).

In summary, the clause directly answers the query by detailing the conditions under which affiliates of either party may assume rights/obligations, reflecting common contractual practices seen in the external examples.",5
License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,41ab1a244e,"Licensee may extend the rights granted herein to register, import, export, store, handle, commercialize, promote, distribute and sell to its Affiliates and to its Distributors, provided that Licensee shall first provide to Licensor a written assurance from each of such Affiliate or Distributor to agree to be bound by, and to strictly comply with, all applicable terms, conditions, and obligations in this Agreement towards Licensor.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about **license clauses covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee** because it explicitly addresses how the licensee may extend its licensed rights to its affiliates and distributors. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Extension of Rights to Affiliates**:  
   - The clause permits the licensee to extend the licensed rights (e.g., registration, distribution, commercialization) to its **affiliates** and distributors. This ensures that the licensee’s corporate group or related entities can operate under the same license terms.

2. **Conditions for Extension**:  
   - The licensee must provide a **written assurance** from each affiliate or distributor agreeing to:  
     - Be bound by the terms of the agreement.  
     - Comply with all obligations toward the licensor.  
   - This protects the licensor by ensuring affiliates/distributors are contractually obligated to the same standards as the licensee.

3. **Alignment with Query**:  
   - The query seeks clauses addressing affiliates of the licensee/licensor. This clause explicitly covers affiliates of the **licensee** (not the licensor, unless implied by reciprocity or other provisions).  
   - It mirrors common contractual practices where affiliates are included but must adhere to the same terms to prevent loopholes.

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts focus on regulatory consents and restrictions on company actions (e.g., MAUD clauses), they highlight broader themes of:  
- **Subsidiary/Affiliate Obligations**: E.g., ""cause each Company Subsidiary not to"" aligns with the clause’s requirement for affiliates to comply.  
- **Third-Party Compliance**: Similar to requiring ""Consents of Regulatory Authorities,"" the clause mandates formal assurances from affiliates/distributors.  

### Why This Matters:  
The clause ensures the licensor retains control over the license’s scope while allowing the licensee to involve affiliates—a common need in corporate structures. It balances flexibility with enforcement, addressing the query’s core concern about affiliate coverage in licenses.  

**Suggested Enhancement**: If the query also seeks coverage of the *licensor’s* affiliates, a reciprocal clause or a definition of ""Affiliates"" (e.g., entities controlling/controlled by a party) would be needed. The current clause focuses on the licensee’s affiliates.",5
License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,6c03a4a6cd,"Licensee shall not be entitled to assign the License or any of its rights under this Agreement or to grant any sub-licenses. This Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, nor may any right or obligations hereunder be assigned or transferred, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that Licensor may, without such consent, assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to an Affiliate or in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to the Licensed Product or the business relating thereto, or in the event of its merger or consolidation or change in control or similar transaction.","The query asks about a **license clause covering affiliates of the licensor and/or licensee**, and the provided clause addresses this directly in the context of **assignment and transfer rights** involving affiliates. Here’s the relevance:

### Key Points in the Clause:
1. **Restriction on Assignment by Licensee**:  
   - The Licensee cannot assign the license, rights, or grant sub-licenses *without consent*. This implicitly includes affiliates of the Licensee unless explicitly exempted (which it is not).  

2. **Assignment Rights for Licensor**:  
   - The Licensor **may assign the agreement to an Affiliate without the other Party’s consent**. This explicitly covers affiliates of the Licensor, addressing the query.  
   - The Licensor may also assign in cases of mergers, asset sales, or change of control (which often involve affiliates or parent/subsidiary entities).  

3. **General Transfer Restrictions**:  
   - Both parties are otherwise prohibited from assigning/transferring rights/obligations without consent, but the Licensor’s carve-out for affiliates creates an asymmetry favoring the Licensor’s corporate group.  

### Connection to External Information:  
The external examples (e.g., MAUD clauses) highlight similar concepts:  
- Restrictions on actions by a party and its subsidiaries (analogous to affiliates) without consent.  
- Exceptions for assignments to affiliates or corporate transactions (mirroring the Licensor’s rights here).  

### Why It Answers the Query:  
The clause **explicitly governs affiliates of the Licensor** by permitting assignment to them without consent, while **implicitly restricting affiliates of the Licensee** (by omitting such an exception). This balances control:  
- **Licensor’s flexibility**: Affiliates are integrated into its operational structure.  
- **Licensee’s constraints**: Prevents uncontrolled delegation to third parties (including affiliates).  

For a comprehensive clause, you might also define ""Affiliate"" elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., entities under common control) to avoid ambiguity.  

**TL;DR**: The clause directly addresses affiliates of the Licensor (allowing assignment to them) and indirectly restricts affiliates of the Licensee (by requiring consent for any assignment). This aligns with the query’s focus on affiliate coverage in licensing.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause Related to Source Code Escrow:
1. **Escrow Agreement Execution**:  
   - Commerce One (the licensor) must execute an escrow agreement with Corio (the licensee) and a mutually acceptable escrow agent within 60 days of the Effective Date.  
   - This ensures the source code is securely held by a neutral third party (the Escrow Agent).

2. **Escrow Account Setup**:  
   - Corio bears all costs for opening and maintaining the escrow account.  
   - The Escrow Agent requires Commerce One to deposit the **source code, updates, upgrades, and documentation** into an escrow account in California.

3. **Release Conditions**:  
   - The clause defines specific events (""Release Conditions"") under which Corio can access the source code:  
     - Commerce One’s dissolution or cessation of business.  
     - Repeated/material breaches of support obligations (uncured after 60 days' notice).  
   - Corio must notify Commerce One and attempt to resolve disputes (via negotiation or arbitration) before release.

4. **License Upon Release**:  
   - If the source code is released, Corio gains a **royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to use/modify the code solely to support/maintain the software for its customers until their end-user agreements expire or terminate.  
   - Corio must maintain confidentiality (per Section 10) and limit use to purposes under Section 12.3.

5. **Dispute Resolution**:  
   - Disputes over Release Conditions trigger a 10-day negotiation period, followed by arbitration (per Section 14.3) if unresolved.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
This clause exemplifies a **standard source code escrow mechanism** in software licensing agreements. It protects the licensee (Corio) by ensuring access to critical source code if the licensor (Commerce One) fails to meet obligations or ceases operations. The external information (about termination fees) is unrelated, but the clause itself directly addresses:  
- **Escrow setup**, **deposit requirements**, **release triggers**, **post-release rights**, and **confidentiality**—all core to source code escrow agreements.  

For further context, similar clauses are common in SaaS or licensed software contracts to mitigate risk for licensees dependent on the licensor’s ongoing support.",5

1. **Escrow Agreement Execution**:  
   - Commerce One is required to execute an escrow agreement with Corio and a mutually acceptable escrow agent within 60 days of the Effective Date. This ensures that the source code is securely held by a neutral third party (the Escrow Agent).

2. **Escrow Account Maintenance**:  
   - Corio bears all fees and expenses for opening and maintaining the escrow account, which is a common practice in source code escrow agreements to ensure continuity.

3. **Deposit of Source Code**:  
   - The Escrow Agent must hold a copy of the source code, including updates, upgrades, and documentation, in an escrow account in California. This safeguards Corio’s access to the source code if certain triggering events occur.

4. **Release Conditions**:  
   - The clause defines specific **Release Conditions** under which Corio can request the source code, such as:  
     - Commerce One’s dissolution or cessation of business.  
     - Repeated and material breaches of support/maintenance obligations (uncured after 60 days' notice).  
   - This protects Corio’s ability to maintain and support the Software if Commerce One fails to meet its obligations.

Here's a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Elements of the Source Code Escrow Clause:
1. **Escrow Setup**:  
   - Changepoint must deposit the **source code**, updates, upgrades, and related documentation into an escrow account in Toronto within 60 days of the agreement's effective date.  
   - The escrow agent is mutually agreed upon by both parties.

2. **Release Conditions**:  
   The source code can be released to Corio if either of the following occurs (defined as **Release Conditions**):  
   - **Changepoint's insolvency or cessation of business** (excluding mergers/acquisitions).  
   - **Material breach of support obligations** (e.g., failure to fix critical errors) that remains uncured for 60 days after written notice.  

3. **Confidentiality & Use Restrictions**:  
   - Corio must keep the source code confidential and use it **only for purposes specified in Section 12.3** (likely limited to maintaining software functionality for customers).  

4. **Survival Beyond Termination**:  
   - The escrow obligation persists even after the agreement ends, covering the duration of Corio's ongoing customer contracts.  

5. **Cost Allocation**:  
   - Corio bears all costs of establishing and maintaining the escrow account.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause directly addresses **source code escrow mechanics**, including triggers for release, confidentiality, and post-termination obligations.  
- It ensures **business continuity** for Corio if Changepoint fails to meet its obligations (e.g., bankruptcy or breach).  
- The external information (though about termination fees in an acquisition context) is less relevant here, as the focus is on **escrow terms** rather than M&A penalties.  

### Why It Matters:  
Source code escrow clauses are critical in software licensing to mitigate risks for licensees (like Corio) if the vendor (Changepoint) becomes unable to support the software. This clause provides legal safeguards for access to the source code under predefined emergencies, ensuring operational resilience.

Here's how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance to Source Code Escrow:
1. **Escrow Mechanism**:  
   - The clause establishes an escrow arrangement where **Changepoint** (the software provider) must deposit the **source code**, updates, upgrades, and related documentation into an escrow account held by a third-party **Escrow Agent** in Toronto.  
   - This ensures **Corio** (the licensee) can access the source code under specific conditions, safeguarding against risks like the vendor’s insolvency or failure to meet support obligations.

2. **Release Conditions**:  
   - The clause defines **Release Conditions** (e.g., Changepoint’s dissolution or material breach of support obligations) under which Corio can request the source code from escrow.  
   - This mitigates risks for Corio by ensuring continuity of software maintenance if Changepoint becomes unable to fulfill its obligations.

3. **Confidentiality and Use Restrictions**:  
   - Corio is bound to keep the source code confidential and may only use it for purposes specified in the agreement (e.g., maintaining software for customers).  
   - This balances protection of Changepoint’s intellectual property with Corio’s operational needs.

4. **Escrow Agreement Execution**:  
   - The clause mandates execution of a formal **escrow agreement** within 60 days of the Effective Date, involving Changepoint, Corio, and a mutually agreed Escrow Agent.  
   - This ensures enforceability and clarity in the escrow process.

5. **Survival Beyond Termination**:  
   - The escrow obligation survives termination/expiration of the agreement, lasting for the duration of Corio’s contracts with its customers.  
   - This provides long-term protection for Corio’s service commitments.

6. **Cost Allocation**:  
   - Corio bears all costs of maintaining the escrow account, clarifying financial responsibilities.

   - This ensures the escrow remains active and up-to-date, protecting the customer’s interests.  

### 3. **Conditions for Release**  
   The source code is released to the customer **only under specific triggering events**, such as:  
   - **M&I ceasing business** or refusing to provide services.  
   - **M&I filing for bankruptcy** (voluntary or involuntary) or failing to assume the agreement under bankruptcy proceedings.  
   - A creditor seizing M&I’s assets, with no resolution within **60 days** (if involuntary).  

### 4. **Usage Restrictions**  
   - The customer is granted a **non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to use the source code **only for internal processing needs**.  
   - **Prohibited actions** include:  
     - Distributing, selling, or sublicensing the code.  
     - Using it for **service bureau or third-party computing services**.  
     - Processing data outside the original functionalities provided by M&I.  

### 5. **Connection to External References**  
   - While the external references discuss **termination clauses** and **business conduct pre-merger**, they do not directly address escrow. However, they highlight the importance of **contractual safeguards** (e.g., termination rights, material breach clauses), which align with the escrow clause’s purpose: **protecting the customer if M&I fails to meet obligations**.  

### **Why This Matters for Source Code Escrow**  
This clause ensures:  
✅ **Business Continuity** – If M&I becomes insolvent or stops operations, the customer can still maintain critical software.  
✅ **IP Protection** – Strict usage terms prevent misuse of the source code.

   - Allows audits by **certified public accountants (independent auditors)**, ensuring credibility and professionalism.

4. **Notice Requirements**:  
   - Requires **15 days’ prior notice**, balancing the audited party’s need for preparation with the auditor’s right to access.

5. **Cost Allocation**:  
   - Audits are generally **borne by the auditing party**, but if a **>3% deficiency** is found, the audited party covers audit costs and pays the deficiency within **5 business days**. This incentivizes accuracy in financial reporting.

6. **Non-Prejudice Provision**:  
   - Clarifies that audit findings or payments do **not waive future disputes**, preserving legal rights even after acceptance of results.

7. **Subsidiaries/Affiliates**:  
   - Extends audit rights to **subsidiaries or affiliates** of the parties, ensuring comprehensive coverage across related entities.

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause directly addresses **how, when, and by whom audits may be conducted**, which is the core of the query.  
- It aligns with typical contractual audit rights by balancing **transparency** (access to records) with **practical safeguards** (notice periods, cost rules).  
- The **3% deficiency threshold** and cost-shifting mechanism is a common risk-mitigation tool, ensuring accountability for material errors.  
- The inclusion of subsidiaries/affiliates ensures the clause’s applicability to broader corporate structures, which is critical in mergers or complex transactions (as hinted in the external information about regulatory approvals).  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts focus on **regulatory cooperation** and **merger-related timelines**, the audit clause complements such provisions by ensuring financial accountability post-transaction. For example:  
- If regulatory approvals (mentioned in `maud_976`) involve financial disclosures, audit rights verify compliance.  
- The **2-day notice period** for material changes in `maud_979` contrasts with the **15-day audit notice**, highlighting differentiated timelines for different purposes.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a **robust framework for audit rights**, ensuring financial oversight while protecting both parties’ interests. It answers the query by detailing procedural, financial, and legal facets of audits in contractual relationships.",5
Audit Rights,9ac147889f,"The Auditing Party agrees that any information learned or disclosed by its auditor in connection with such audit is Confidential Information of the Audited Party. Each Party (the ""Audited Party') will, upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written request by the other Party (the ""Auditing Party""), allow an independent certified public<omitted>accounting firm selected by the Auditing Party and reasonably acceptable to the Audited Party to audit such books and records at the Audited Party's premises to the extent necessary to verify the Audited Party's compliance or non-compliance with the provisions of this Section 9 (or, in the case of Company, Section 5.4 [Royalties]); provided, that: (a) any such audit is conducted during normal business hours and in a manner designed to not unreasonably interfere with the Audited Party's ordinary business operations; (b) audits may not occur more frequently than once every twelve (12) months; and (c) each such audit may only cover the period commencing after the period covered by the last audit conducted pursuant to this Section, if any.","The **Audit Rights** clause you provided is relevant to the query as it establishes the framework for how one party (the ""Auditing Party"") may inspect and verify the records of another party (the ""Audited Party"") to ensure compliance with contractual obligations, particularly financial or operational terms (e.g., royalties under Section 5.4). Here’s how it connects to the broader context:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Confidentiality of Audit Information**:  
   - The clause specifies that any information disclosed during an audit is treated as **Confidential Information** of the Audited Party. This aligns with the external information provided (e.g., Section 5.3(b) of the referenced agreement), where non-public information shared with third parties must be protected under confidentiality agreements. The audit clause ensures sensitive data remains protected even during compliance verification.

2. **Procedural Safeguards**:  
   - The clause imposes strict conditions on audits (e.g., 30 days' notice, limited frequency, normal business hours) to **minimize disruption** to the Audited Party. This mirrors the external text’s emphasis on balancing transparency with operational continuity (e.g., Section 5.3(a) restricts unsolicited disclosures to avoid interference with business operations).

3. **Verification of Compliance**:  
   - The audit right is tied to verifying adherence to specific contractual sections (e.g., Section 9 or royalty obligations). This is analogous to the external text’s focus on **fiduciary duties** and compliance (e.g., Section 5.3(b) allows disclosures only if the Company Board determines it’s necessary for a Superior Proposal). Both clauses ensure actions are justified and documented.

4. **Third-Party Involvement**:  
   - The clause requires auditors to be **independent and mutually acceptable**, similar to how the external text permits discussions with third parties only under an ""Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement."" Both ensure external reviews are conducted neutrally and without conflicts.

### Contrast with External Context:
- While the external text (Section 5.3) governs **solicitation of acquisition proposals** and disclosures to potential buyers, the audit clause focuses on **post-agreement compliance checks**. However, both share themes of controlled information sharing and procedural rigor to protect parties’ interests.

### Conclusion:
The clause is relevant as it operationalizes **accountability** through structured audit rights while safeguarding confidentiality and business operations—principles also reflected in the external material’s handling of sensitive information and fiduciary obligations. It complements the broader agreement by adding a layer of enforceable oversight.",5
Audit Rights,9d14cb30dc,"The Auditing Party shall give reasonable advance written notice to the Audited Party, and each audit shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that does not cause unreasonable disruption to the conduct of business by the Audited Party. The Auditing Party may cause the Auditor to perform such an audit not more than once in any 12-month period, unless a prior audit within the past two years revealed that the amount owed by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party was underpaid in excess of 8% of the amount owed, in which case an audit may be performed no more frequently than twice in any 12-month period. During the 18-month period following the payment by one Party of any amount due under this Agreement to the other Party, the Party receiving payment (the ""Auditing Party"") shall have the right, at its own expense, to have an independent ""Big Five"" accounting firm (the ""Auditor"") audit the financial records of the other Party (the ""Audited Party"") relating to such payment to verify the accuracy of the Audited Party's financial records in order to verify the amount of the payments owed and/or paid.","The **Audit Rights** clause is relevant to the query because it establishes the framework under which one party (the ""Auditing Party"") can inspect the financial records of the other party (the ""Audited Party"") to verify the accuracy of payments made under the agreement. Here’s how it connects to the broader context:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Verification of Payments**:  
   - The clause ensures that payments (such as termination fees or other obligations referenced in the external information) are accurately calculated and paid.  
   - For example, if the **Company Termination Fee** (mentioned in the external excerpts) is disputed, the Auditing Party (e.g., Parent) could audit the Company's records to confirm compliance.

2. **Frequency and Conditions for Audits**:  
   - Audits are limited to **once per 12-month period** unless a prior audit revealed a material underpayment (>8% of the amount owed), allowing for **twice per year** in such cases.  
   - This prevents excessive audits while safeguarding against significant discrepancies.

3. **Timing and Scope**:  
   - Audits can only occur **within 18 months** of a payment, ensuring timely verification.  
   - The audit focuses on records **directly related to the payment**, which could include fees tied to termination or competing proposals (as referenced in the external clauses).

4. **Procedural Protections**:  
   - Requires **advance notice** and audits during **normal business hours** to minimize disruption.  
   - Specifies the use of a **""Big Five"" accounting firm**, ensuring credibility and professionalism.

### Connection to External Context:
- The external excerpts discuss **termination fees** and **competing proposals**, which are financial obligations subject to potential disputes.  
- The Audit Rights clause provides a mechanism to **verify such payments**, ensuring transparency and compliance with the agreement (e.g., confirming the correct calculation of the ""Company Termination Fee"" under Section 8.3).  

### Why It Matters:
This clause mitigates financial risk by allowing parties to independently verify payments, reducing the likelihood of underpayment or overpayment disputes. It aligns with the broader contractual goal of enforcing payment obligations (like those in Sections 8.3(d) and 8.3(e)) while balancing operational practicality.  

In summary, the Audit Rights clause is a **critical control mechanism** to ensure financial accuracy and enforceability of payment terms, directly supporting the integrity of provisions like those cited in the external information.",5

Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice from a Party (the ""Auditing Party""), the other Party (the ""Audited Party"") shall permit an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally recognized standing selected by the Auditing Party and reasonably acceptable to the Audited Party, to examine, at the Auditing Party's sole expense, the relevant books and records of the Audited Party and its Affiliates as may be reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the reports submitted by the Audited Party in accordance with Sections 3.4(d), 4.1(c) and 4.3(a) and the payment of Promotion Fees hereunder.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **""Audit Rights""** as it explicitly outlines the rights and procedures for conducting audits between the parties to the agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Audit Rights Clause:
1. **Trigger for Audit**:
   - An audit can be initiated by the **Auditing Party** upon providing **30 days' prior written notice** to the **Audited Party**.
   - The audit can be triggered if the Auditing Party has **credible evidence** of a violation of the agreement (e.g., breach of terms related to Product Training under Section 3(e)).

2. **Scope of Audit**:
   - The Audited Party must grant the Auditing Party's external auditors access to:
     - **Relevant books, documents, papers, and records** related to reports under **Sections 3.2(d), 3.4(d), and 4.3(a)**.
     - Records of activities performed under the agreement.
   - The audit may also verify the accuracy of reports and payments (e.g., **Promotion Fees**) under **Sections 3.4(d), 4.1(c), and 4.3(a)**.

3. **Independent Auditor**:
   - The Auditing Party may appoint an **independent certified public accounting firm** (of nationally recognized standing and reasonably acceptable to the Audited Party) to examine the Audited Party's books and records.
   - The audit is conducted **at the Auditing Party's expense**.

4. **Purpose**:
   - To ensure compliance with the agreement (e.g., financial reporting, payment obligations, or adherence to terms like Product Training).
   - To verify the accuracy of submitted reports and payments.

### Connection to the Query:
- The clause directly addresses **audit rights** by defining:
  - **When audits can occur** (upon credible evidence of a breach or for routine verification).
  - **How audits are conducted** (notice period, auditor selection, scope).
  - **What can be audited** (specific sections of the agreement, financial records, and activities).
- It aligns with typical audit rights provisions in contracts, which aim to provide transparency and accountability between parties.

### Contrast with External Information:
The external excerpts provided (e.g., about regulatory approvals or change of recommendation procedures) are unrelated to audit rights. Your clause, however, is a **standalone audit provision** focused on financial and compliance verification, making it directly responsive to the query.

### Practical Implications:
- **For the Auditing Party**: Provides a contractual right to investigate potential breaches or inaccuracies.
- **For the Audited Party**: Obligates cooperation but includes safeguards (e.g., reasonable notice, auditor acceptability).
- **For Both Parties**: Ensures contractual performance can be monitored and enforced.

In summary, this clause is a **comprehensive audit rights provision** that answers the query by detailing the mechanics, scope, and purpose of audits under the agreement.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Audit Rights Clause:
1. **Notice and Timing**:  
   - The Auditing Party must provide **reasonable advance written notice** before conducting an audit.  
   - Audits must occur during **normal business hours** and avoid **unreasonable disruption** to the Audited Party’s operations.  

2. **Scope of Audit**:  
   - The audit is limited to verifying the **accuracy of financial records** related to payments made under the agreement.  
   - The purpose is to confirm whether the **correct amount was owed and/or paid**.  

3. **Timeframe for Exercising Audit Rights**:  
   - The right to audit is available for **18 months** after a payment is made. This creates a clear window for dispute resolution or verification.  

4. **Independent Third-Party Auditor**:  
   - The audit must be conducted by an **independent third party (the ""Auditor"")**, ensuring objectivity and fairness.  

### Relevance to the Query:

- It balances the interests of both parties:  
  - The Auditing Party gets **transparency and verification rights**.  
  - The Audited Party is protected from **excessive or disruptive audits**.  
- The **18-month limitation** ensures audits are timely and relevant, preventing indefinite liability.  

### Comparison with External Information:
While the external references provided discuss **regulatory approvals** and **termination fees**, they do not directly address audit rights. However, they highlight how contracts structure **rights, obligations, and timeframes** (e.g., 30-day filing deadlines, 12-month termination clauses), which aligns with the **structured approach** seen in the audit clause.  

### Conclusion:
This clause is a **standard but critical** audit rights provision, ensuring financial accountability while minimizing operational interference. It directly answers the query by detailing **how, when, and by whom** audits can be conducted under the agreement.

Liquidated Damages,b992ff50d0,"If Party B shall pay liquidated damages for breach of this Agreement or violation of the platform rules, Party A is entitled to request Party B to pay the liquidated damages. In this case, Party B shall pay additional deposit equivalent to the liquidated damages when it pays the liquidated damages. The following acts constitute Class B breaches. In the event of any breach below by Party B, Party B shall immediately remedy the breach, and Party A is entitled to request Party B to pay the liquidated damages of an amount from RMB1,000 (RMB ONE THOUSAND) to RMB 5,000 (RMB FIVE THOUSAND) based on the consequences of the breach, and send the Confirmation Letter on the Breach of the Partner of Xiaoju Online Ride-hailing Marketplace to Party B. In the case of a written notice 15 days in advance from either party to the other Party And a payment of the liquidated damages of RMB10,000 (RMB TEN THOUSAND), this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of termination stated in the notice of termination. In case that the Driver User unilaterally terminates the Financial Leasing Agreement in advance, Party B shall collect the liquidated damages from the Driver User within 30% of the ""down payment + total monthly rent + last payment"" stipulated in the Financial Leasing Agreement; Any violation of this article by Party B shall be considered as a material breach of the this Agreement, and Party A is entitled to immediately terminate this Agreement and the cooperation relationship between the Parties, and request Party B to pay the liquidated damages of RMB 50,000 (RMB FIFTY THOUSAND) and indemnify for all losses incurred to Party A thereby.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause Related to Liquidated Damages:
1. **Definition of Breaches and Corresponding Damages**:  
   - The clause categorizes breaches into **Class B, C, and D**, each with specified liquidated damages ranges (e.g., RMB 1,000–5,000 for Class B, RMB 5,000–50,000 for Class C, and a fixed RMB 50,000 for Class D).  
   - This mirrors the concept in the external information where termination fees (a form of liquidated damages) are triggered under specific conditions (e.g., termination of the agreement within 12 months).

2. **Triggering Events for Liquidated Damages**:  
   - Similar to the external example (where a termination fee is paid if an ""Acquisition Transaction"" occurs), this clause specifies scenarios where liquidated damages apply, such as:  
     - Breach of platform rules or agreement terms.  
     - Unilateral termination of the Financial Leasing Agreement by the Driver User (with damages calculated as 30% of specified payments).  
     - Material breaches (e.g., violations of specific clauses leading to termination and fixed damages of RMB 50,000).  

3. **Payment Mechanism**:  
   - The clause details **how** liquidated damages are paid:  
     - Party B must pay the damages **and** an equivalent additional deposit (e.g., ""if Party B pays RMB N, it must add RMB N to the deposit"").  
     - Party A may deduct damages from the deposit.  
   - This aligns with the external example’s requirement for payment of a ""Termination Fee"" upon triggering events.  

4. **Termination Linkage**:  
   - Both the clause and the external information tie liquidated damages to **termination rights**. For example:  
     - The clause allows termination upon payment of RMB 10,000 in damages with 15 days’ notice.  
     - The external information mandates a termination fee if the agreement is terminated within 12 months under certain conditions.  

5. **Enforcement and Consequences**:  
   - The clause emphasizes **material breaches** (e.g., RMB 50,000 damages for violations) and indemnification for losses, similar to the external example’s focus on significant transactions (e.g., ""Acquisition Proposal"").  

### Why It Answers the Query:
- The clause **operationalizes liquidated damages** in a contractual context, just as the external information does for termination fees. Both serve as pre-agreed compensation for specific breaches or events, avoiding disputes over actual damages.  
- It demonstrates **variability in damages** (sliding scales for different breach classes) and **fixed amounts** for severe breaches, akin to the external example’s tailored fee structure (e.g., adjusting percentage thresholds for ""Acquisition Transaction"").  

### Practical Implications:
- **Legal Certainty**: Both the clause and the external example provide clarity on financial consequences, reducing litigation risks.  
- **Deterrence**: The graduated penalties (Class B to D) and the external example’s fee structure discourage undesirable actions (e.g., premature termination or competing transactions).  

In summary, the clause is a **detailed application of liquidated damages principles** in a partnership agreement, closely paralleling the logic of the external example but tailored to a different context (ride-hailing platform vs. acquisition transactions). Both ensure contractual compliance through pre-defined financial penalties.",5
Liquidated Damages,78643f2042,"The amounts contemplated under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is not a penalty and is intended by the parties only as a compensatory remedy for past breaches and not as a preventative remedy to deter future breaches. Nevertheless, the parties agree that the lump-sum payment provided under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is reasonable in light of the damages for premature termination that may reasonably be expected to occur in such event. If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum payment in an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your Royalty fees and Advertising Contributions due for the last 60 months before our delivery of notice of default (or, if lesser, the months you had been operating before our delivery of notice of default), (b) multiplied by the lesser of 60 or the number of months remaining in the term of this Agreement. The payments called for in Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above constitute liquidated damages for causing the premature termination of this Agreement and not a penalty.","The clause provided is highly relevant to the query on **""Liquidated Damages""** as it defines the purpose, calculation, and legal characterization of such damages in the context of a contract termination due to default. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Nature of Liquidated Damages**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the payment is **not a penalty** but a **compensatory remedy** for past breaches (e.g., premature termination). This aligns with the legal principle that liquidated damages must reflect a reasonable estimate of actual damages, not punitive measures.  
   - It emphasizes that the amount is intended to cover **foreseeable damages** from termination (e.g., lost royalties or advertising contributions), similar to the ""Termination Fee"" concept in the external examples.

2. **Calculation Methodology**  
   - The formula for calculating the lump-sum payment is detailed:  
     - **Base amount**: Average of Royalty fees and Advertising Contributions over the past 60 months (or fewer if the agreement was shorter).  
     - **Multiplier**: Lesser of 60 months or the remaining term of the agreement.  
   - This ensures the amount is tied to **actual economic impact** (consistent with the ""reasonable in light of damages"" standard mentioned in the clause and echoed in the external examples).

3. **Legal Safeguards**  
   - The clause mirrors the external examples (e.g., *Section 7.02* from *M&A* contexts) by:  
     - Specifying **triggering events** (termination due to default).  
     - Requiring payment **upon written demand** (similar to the ""earlier of"" timing in the external clause).  
     - Avoiding ambiguity by defining the payment as **exclusive** liquidated damages (not a penalty).  

4. **Relevance to External Context**  
   - While the external examples involve **acquisition-related termination fees**, your clause addresses **operational breaches** (e.g., franchise defaults). Both contexts share:  
     - **Compensatory intent**: Both clauses justify amounts based on anticipated damages.  
     - **Reasonableness**: Your clause explicitly states the amount is ""reasonable,"" akin to the *M&A* clause’s focus on proportionality (e.g., adjusting percentage thresholds).  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- The clause demonstrates **best practices** for drafting liquidated damages provisions by:  
  - Distinguishing them from unenforceable penalties.  
  - Linking calculations to **measurable metrics** (e.g., historical royalties).  
  - Aligning with judicial standards for enforceability (e.g., *reasonableness* and *proportionality*).  

- It contrasts with but complements the **M&A-focused examples**, showing how liquidated damages adapt to different contract types (franchising vs. corporate transactions).  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Enforceability**: Courts are more likely to uphold such clauses if they mirror this structure (clear rationale + calculable damages).  
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause shifts the burden of proving damages to the breaching party (simplifying post-breach disputes).  

In summary, this clause directly addresses the query by illustrating how liquidated damages operate in contractual breaches, emphasizing compensatory intent, reasonableness, and calculability—principles also reflected in the external *M&A* examples.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Trigger for Liquidated Damages**:  
   - The clause applies when the agreement is terminated **by the franchisor for cause** (as defined in Section 10). This parallels the external examples where termination triggers a payment obligation (e.g., termination due to an Acquisition Transaction).

2. **Calculation Method**:  
   - The liquidated damages are calculated based on the **average monthly royalty fees** (Unit Franchise Performance and Franchise Sales) paid by the franchisee over the **preceding 12 months**.  
   - The amount is then multiplied by either:  
     - **24 months** (representing 2 full years), **or**  
     - The **remaining months in the agreement term** (whichever is lower).  
   - This ensures the damages are proportionate to the anticipated loss and avoid over-penalization.

3. **Intent and Enforceability**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the parties agree the amount is a **reasonable, good-faith pre-estimate** of damages (not a penalty). This aligns with legal standards for enforceability of liquidated damages clauses.  
   - It also clarifies that the remedy is **specific to breaches of royalty obligations**, acknowledging that other breaches may require different legal remedies.

### Connection to External Examples:  
- The external excerpts involve **termination fees** (a form of liquidated damages) triggered by specific events (e.g., an Acquisition Transaction within 12 months). Similarly, this clause ties liquidated damages to a specific termination scenario (for-cause termination).  
- Both contexts emphasize **predefined calculations** to avoid disputes over actual damages (e.g., royalty fees vs. acquisition-related fees).  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- The clause demonstrates a **practical application** of liquidated damages in contracts, showing how parties agree upfront on compensation for breach/termination.  
- It highlights the importance of:  
  - **Reasonableness** (tying damages to historical payments).  
  - **Proportionality** (capping damages at the lesser of two amounts).  
  - **Scope limitation** (applying only to royalty-related breaches).  

This aligns with broader legal principles where liquidated damages must be a genuine pre-estimate of loss, not punitive. The clause’s structure mitigates risks of unenforceability under contract law.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Trigger for Liquidated Damages**:  
   - The clause applies when the agreement is terminated by one party (the franchisor) **for cause** under **Section 10**. This mirrors the concept in the external examples where termination triggers a payment obligation.

2. **Calculation Method**:  
   - The damages are quantified as a multiple of the franchisee’s average monthly royalty fees (Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee) over the **preceding 12 months**.  
   - The multiplier is the **lesser of**:  
     - **24 months** (representing 2 full years), or  
     - The **remaining term** of the agreement.  
   - This ensures the damages are proportionate to the anticipated harm (lost royalties) while avoiding over-penalization.

3. **Intent and Enforceability**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the parties agree the amount is a **reasonable pre-estimate of damages** (not a penalty), which aligns with legal standards for enforceability of liquidated damages clauses.  
   - It clarifies that the remedy is **specific to breaches of royalty obligations**, not other provisions of the agreement, limiting its scope.

### Connection to External Examples:  
While the external examples involve **termination fees in merger agreements** (e.g., ""Acquisition Transaction"" triggers), the underlying principle is similar:  
- Both scenarios define **predetermined payments** upon termination to compensate for anticipated losses.  
- Both emphasize **reasonableness** (e.g., adjusting percentage thresholds in the external text vs. capping damages at the remaining term in the clause).  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause demonstrates a **practical application of liquidated damages** in contracts, addressing:  
- **Predictability**: Parties avoid litigation over uncertain actual damages.  
- **Risk Allocation**: The franchisee bears the cost of early termination, discouraging breaches.  
- **Legal Compliance**: The clause is crafted to meet judicial standards (e.g., reasonable estimate, not punitive).  

### Key Difference:  
The external examples focus on **corporate transactions** (e.g., mergers), while the clause pertains to **franchise agreements**. However, both serve the same core purpose: **providing a pre-agreed remedy for specific termination events**.

Liquidated Damages,0b57cad5d5,"Party B shall pay one-month freight as liquidated damages in case of termination of the Agreement without consent. Unless otherwise approved by Party A, in the event of parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle delay, Party B shall pay liquidated damages to Party A at the standard rate of RMB500 per trip on the first working day, RMB1,000 per trip on the second working day and RMB2,000 per trip on the third working day (based on the time records on the parcel transfer documents) and such liquidated damages will be deducted from the current month's freight.","The clause provided is relevant to the query on **""Liquidated Damages""** as it outlines specific scenarios where such damages are payable and the methodology for calculating them. Here’s how it aligns with the broader concept of liquidated damages:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Definition of Triggering Events**:  
   - The clause specifies two scenarios where liquidated damages apply:  
     - **Termination without consent**: Party B must pay one-month freight as damages.  
     - **Parcel transfer delays due to Party B’s vehicle delay**: Damages escalate daily (RMB500–RMB2,000 per trip).  
   - This mirrors the external examples where liquidated damages are triggered by specific actions (e.g., termination or entering into an Acquisition Transaction within 12 months).

2. **Pre-agreed Compensation**:  
   - Like the external clauses (where a ""Termination Fee"" is predefined), this clause fixes damages at predetermined amounts (e.g., one-month freight or tiered trip rates). This avoids disputes over actual losses and ensures certainty.

3. **Enforceability Conditions**:  
   - The clause ties damages to measurable standards (e.g., time records on transfer documents), similar to the external reference adjusting the threshold for an ""Acquisition Transaction"" (20% to 50%). Both ensure clarity and reduce ambiguity.

4. **Deduction Mechanism**:  
   - The clause specifies that damages will be deducted from the current month’s freight, akin to the external example’s requirement to pay the fee upon triggering events. Both ensure timely payment.

### Contrast with External Examples:
- **Scope**: The external examples focus on corporate transactions (e.g., mergers), while this clause addresses logistics (freight/parcel delays).  
- **Complexity**: The external clauses involve multi-party corporate terms (e.g., ""Acquisition Proposal""), whereas this clause is operational and linear in its triggers.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause exemplifies **liquidated damages** in a commercial contract by defining triggers, amounts, and payment methods—aligning with the core purpose seen in the external examples (predictability and compensation for breach). It is simpler in context but equally precise in enforcing pre-agreed remedies.",5
Insurance,e0cb23f233,"Each Party shall purchase and maintain, at its own expense, the following insurance coverages:
(a) cargo liability insurance, subject to a combined single limit of not less than One Hundred Thousand dollars ($100,000.00) inclusive per occurrence. The other Party shall be named as an additional insured and the policy shall contain a cross liability clause;
(b) automobile, non-owned automobile, fleet, comprehensive general, public and property liability insurance with a limit of not less than Two Million dollars ($2,000,000.00) inclusive of bodily injury and property damage for any one occurrence arising out of one (1) cause. The policy shall cover all non-air operations, non-owned automobile, contractual liability and liability specifically assumed under this Agreement. The other party shall be named as an additional insured and the policy shall contain a cross liability clause; Each Party shall deliver to the other, prior to commencing to provide the Services and thereafter, annually, a certificate or certificates of insurance evidencing that the required insurance coverages as provided for in paragraph 9.1 are in effect and that each Party shall be given thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation or expiry of or material change to such insurance coverages. Each Party shall maintain the insurance coverages provided for in paragraph 9.1 hereof, in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement and covenants that nothing shall be done whereby any policy will be cancelled and shall pay all renewal premiums thereon on or before the due date and shall forthwith furnish the other Party with copies of certificates of insurance of such renewals. Each Party shall ensure that any subcontractor or other party with whom it contracts in providing the Services shall carry adequate insurance coverage, but not less than that provided in paragraph 9.1.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **insurance** in a legal contract context. Here's how it connects:

### Key Relevance to ""Insurance"":
1. **Insurance Requirements**  
   The clause explicitly outlines the insurance obligations of each party, including:  
   - **Types of coverage** (e.g., cargo liability, automobile, general liability).  
   - **Minimum coverage limits** (e.g., $100,000 for cargo liability, $2,000,000 for general liability).  
   - **Specific policy terms** (e.g., naming the other party as an additional insured, cross-liability clauses).  

2. **Certification and Compliance**  
   - Parties must provide **certificates of insurance** to prove coverage is active.  
   - Requires **30 days' notice** for cancellations/expirations, ensuring continuous protection.  

3. **Subcontractor Obligations**  
   Extends insurance requirements to subcontractors, ensuring all entities involved maintain adequate coverage.  

4. **Enforcement Mechanisms**  
   While not directly tied to the ""Specific Performance"" provision in the external information, the clause implicitly supports enforceability. If a party fails to maintain insurance, the other party could seek remedies (e.g., specific performance or injunctive relief, as referenced in the external text) to compel compliance, given the material risk of uninsured liabilities.  

### Connection to External Context:  
The external text highlights **specific performance** as a remedy for breaches. Here, if a party neglects its insurance duties (a breach of covenant), the other party could invoke similar legal remedies to enforce compliance, as monetary damages alone might not suffice (e.g., if uninsured risks lead to irreparable harm).  

### Summary:  
This clause is a **detailed insurance framework** ensuring risk mitigation, with indirect ties to broader contractual enforcement mechanisms (like specific performance). It directly addresses the query by defining insurance obligations critical to contractual risk allocation.

Insurance,e62f22895e,"[*] will have insurance policies with reputable insurers to provide coverage and amounts that secure its obligations and potential liabilities under this Agreement. [*] is responsible for all premiums, deductibles and retentions for such insurance. After this Agreement expires or terminates, [*] will either have an active policy or purchase an extended reporting period that has coverage for claims first made and reported to the insurer within 2 years after this Agreement expires or terminates","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **""Insurance""** in a legal contract context. Here's how it connects:

### Key Relevance to Insurance:
1. **Insurance Coverage Requirement**  
   - The clause mandates that [*] (a party to the agreement) must maintain **active insurance policies** with **reputable insurers**. This directly addresses the query by specifying the need for insurance to cover potential liabilities under the agreement.  
   - The policies must provide **adequate coverage amounts**, ensuring financial protection for obligations arising from the contract.

2. **Financial Responsibility**  
   - [*] is explicitly responsible for **premiums, deductibles, and retentions**, clarifying who bears the costs associated with the insurance. This is critical for risk allocation in contracts.

3. **Post-Termination Coverage**  
   - The clause includes a **tail coverage** provision: even after the agreement ends, [*] must either:  
     - Keep an active policy, **or**  
     - Purchase an **extended reporting period (ERP)** covering claims made and reported within **2 years post-termination**.  
   - This ensures protection against **latent claims** (e.g., errors or omissions discovered after the contract ends), which is a common concern in liability insurance.

### Connection to External Context:  
While the external excerpts focus on **termination fees** and **conditions to an offer**, they highlight broader contractual themes (e.g., liabilities, post-termination obligations) that align with the insurance clause’s purpose:  
- The insurance clause mitigates risks similar to those in the external texts (e.g., liabilities from breaches or post-termination events).  
- The **12-month window** for termination fees in *maud_167* and the **material adverse effect** qualifiers in *maud_942* underscore the importance of financial safeguards like insurance to address contingent liabilities.

### Why This Matters for ""Insurance"":  
The clause ensures that:  
- Risks are transferred to insurers, reducing exposure for both parties.  
- Compliance with insurance requirements is a **material obligation**, akin to representations/warranties in *maud_942*.  
- Post-termination coverage aligns with the contractual focus on **long-tail risks** (similar to the *maud_167* termination fee timeline).  

In summary, this clause operationalizes the query by detailing **what insurance is required, who pays for it, and how long coverage must last**—key elements in contract risk management.",5
Insurance,ada8e4ca9d,"In the event of any material change or cancellation of the required insurance policies, the applicable Party will provide the other Party with thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice and will promptly replace such insurance policy in accordance with this Section 15, without lapse in coverage.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Insurance-Related Provisions in the Clause:
1. **Notice of Changes/Cancellation**:  
   - Requires a party to notify the other party **30 days in advance** of any material change or cancellation of required insurance policies.  
   - Ensures transparency and allows the other party to take corrective action (e.g., securing alternative coverage).  

2. **Replacement of Lapsed Coverage**:  
   - Mandates that the affected party **promptly replace** the insurance policy **without lapse**, ensuring continuous protection.  

3. **Proof of Insurance**:  
   - Obligates parties to provide **certificates of insurance** as evidence of coverage upon request or at execution of the agreement.  
   - Ensures verifiability and compliance with agreed terms.  

4. **Minimum Insurance Requirements**:  
   - Specifies two critical types of insurance that must be maintained **during the term and for 1 year post-termination**:  
     - **Comprehensive General Liability Insurance**: Covers bodily injury, property damage, and product liability ($1M minimum).  
     - **Technology Liability Insurance**: Covers information/network technology risks ($1M aggregate).  
   - Demonstrates risk allocation and financial safeguards for potential liabilities.  

### Connection to the Query:  
The clause directly addresses **insurance obligations** in a contract, which is the focus of the query. It:  
- Defines **procedures** for managing insurance policies (e.g., notice, replacement).  
- Sets **minimum standards** for coverage (types, limits, duration).  
- Aligns with broader contractual risk management, similar to the ""Specific Performance"" clauses in the external examples (which emphasize equitable remedies for breaches). Here, insurance acts as a **financial remedy** to mitigate risks.  

### Why It Matters:  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Ensures parties are protected against liabilities (e.g., lawsuits, property damage).  
- **Contractual Compliance**: Failure to maintain insurance could trigger breaches, akin to the ""irreparable harm"" scenarios in the external examples, potentially leading to claims for damages or injunctive relief.  
- **Business Continuity**: Prevents disruptions (e.g., lapses in coverage could expose parties to uninsured losses).  

In summary, this clause is a **core insurance provision** in a contract, detailing practical safeguards and enforceable requirements tailored to the query’s subject.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Insurance Requirements in the Clause:
1. **Types of Insurance Coverage**:
   - **Excess Liability Insurance**: Covers employer's liability, commercial general liability, and business automobile liability with a $5M combined single limit per occurrence/aggregate.
   - **Worker’s Compensation Insurance**: Mandated by law where services are performed, with employer’s liability coverage of $1M per accident/aggregate.
   - **Commercial General Liability (CGL) Insurance**: Minimum $2M per occurrence/aggregate, including broad-form coverage (e.g., contractual liability, property damage, products/completed operations).
   - **Automobile Liability Insurance**: Covers owned/non-owned/hired vehicles with $1M per accident limit.

2. **Policy Endorsements**:
   - **Primary Coverage**: The Service Provider’s insurance must be primary (not secondary to Owner/User’s insurance).
   - **Additional Insureds**: Owner, User, and potentially User’s landlord or other parties must be added as additional insureds.
   - **Severability Clause**: Ensures coverage applies separately to each insured party.

3. **Certification and Carrier Approval**:
   - Proof of insurance (certificate) must be provided within 30 days of the Effective Date.
   - Insurance carriers must be ""reasonably acceptable"" to the Owner.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **defines specific insurance obligations** for the Service Provider, ensuring risk mitigation for the Owner/User. This aligns with common contractual requirements in service agreements, particularly where liability risks (e.g., bodily injury, property damage) are involved.
- It addresses **compliance with legal standards** (e.g., worker’s compensation) and **industry practices** (e.g., CGL coverage limits).
- The **endorsement requirements** (primary coverage, additional insureds) are critical for clarifying how insurance applies in multi-party scenarios, preventing gaps in coverage.
- The external information (from the MAUD document) highlights exclusions from ""Material Adverse Effect"" related to insurance industry changes (e.g., SAP/GAAP adjustments, market conditions). While not directly tied to your clause, it underscores the importance of **insurance-specific terms** in contracts to allocate risk.

### Practical Implications:
- The clause shifts liability risks to the Service Provider’s insurers, protecting the Owner/User from financial losses arising from the Services.
- It ensures transparency (via certificates) and quality control (via carrier approval) in insurance procurement.

In summary, this clause is a **detailed insurance framework** tailored to a service provider context, directly addressing the query by outlining coverage types, limits, endorsements, and compliance mechanisms.",5
Insurance,996a52f6b8,"Service Provider shall provide and maintain excess liability insurance covering employer's liability, commercial general liability, and business automobile liability, in the amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) combined single limit policy limit per occurrence and in the aggregate for bodily injury and property damage.

Here's how it connects:

### Key Relevance to Insurance:
1. **Insurance Requirements** – The clause explicitly details the insurance obligations of the **Service Provider**, including:
   - **Types of Coverage**: Excess liability, commercial general liability (CGL), business automobile liability, and workers' compensation.
   - **Policy Limits**: Specific monetary thresholds (e.g., $5M combined single limit for excess liability, $1M for employer's liability).
   - **Endorsements**: Conditions like making the policy primary (not excess) to the Owner’s insurance, adding additional insureds (Owner, User, etc.), and including a severability clause.

2. **Alignment with Industry Standards** – The clause mirrors common insurance provisions in service agreements, ensuring risk mitigation for all parties (similar to the ""Material Adverse Effect"" exclusions in the external information, which carve out industry-wide risks).

3. **Compliance and Certifications** – The Service Provider must provide proof of insurance (certificates) and maintain coverage with carriers acceptable to the Owner, ensuring enforceability and accountability.

4. **Risk Allocation** – By specifying primary/non-contributory wording and additional insured status, the clause allocates liability clearly, akin to how the external material excludes certain events (e.g., pandemics, market changes) from triggering a ""Material Adverse Effect.""

### Connection to External Information:
- The external text (e.g., *maud_593*) discusses exclusions from ""Company Material Adverse Effect,"" including broad industry or economic changes. Similarly, the insurance clause here defines specific risks (e.g., bodily injury, auto accidents) that **must** be covered, leaving no ambiguity about responsibility.
- Both texts emphasize **contractual precision**—one in carving out exceptions, the other in mandating protections.

### Practical Implications:
- **For the Query**: This clause answers questions about insurance requirements in contracts, illustrating how coverage terms are structured to protect parties.
- **For Negotiation**: Parties might debate limits, endorsements, or carrier acceptability (as hinted in *maud_854*’s ""commercially reasonable efforts"" standard).

In summary, the clause is a **detailed insurance framework** ensuring risk transfer, compliance, and clarity—directly addressing the query’s focus on contractual insurance terms.",5
Covenant Not To Sue,f3ceb882eb,"There are no representations, warranties or covenants other than those set forth herein.","The clause **""There are no representations, warranties or covenants other than those set forth herein""** is highly relevant to the query about a **Covenant Not To Sue** because it establishes the principle of contractual exclusivity. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Scope**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the contract contains **no additional representations, warranties, or covenants** beyond what is expressly written in the agreement.  
   - This would include any implied **Covenant Not To Sue** (a promise not to pursue legal action), unless such a covenant is explicitly included in the contract.  

2. **Relevance to External Context**:  
   - The external excerpts discuss conditions where representations/warranties must be ""true and correct"" for an offer to proceed.  
   - If a **Covenant Not To Sue** were intended to bind the parties, it would need to be expressly stated in the contract (per the clause you provided). Otherwise, a party could argue that no such covenant exists, as the contract disclaims any unwritten terms.  

3. **Legal Implications**:  
   - Without an explicit **Covenant Not To Sue**, a party retains the right to litigate over breaches of the agreement.  
   - The clause reinforces that silence on this issue means no such covenant is granted, aligning with the principle that contracts are limited to their written terms.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause acts as a **disclaimer** against implying any unstated promises (including a Covenant Not To Sue), ensuring that only the expressly agreed terms govern the parties' rights and obligations. If the parties intended to include such a covenant, it would need to be explicitly stated in the contract.

Covenant Not To Sue,5963bd4697,"Each party covenants that it shall not, under any circumstances, sue the other party (or its officers, directors, successors and assigns) or any of that parties' licensees, customers, or distributors (""Protected Entities"") for patent infringment under any future patents or future patent rights relating to said Developments, that either party owns or controls, so long as that Protected Entity has a license from Commerce One or Corio to the Software, or to a product that is a modification of, derivative work based on, or replacement for the Software.","The **""Covenant Not To Sue""** clause you provided is directly relevant to the query as it establishes a contractual promise by each party to refrain from initiating legal action (specifically for patent infringement) against the other party or certain protected entities (e.g., officers, directors, licensees, customers, or distributors) under specific conditions. Here’s how it connects to the broader legal context and the external information:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Scope of Protection**:  
   - The covenant covers future patents or patent rights related to ""Developments"" (likely defined elsewhere in the agreement).  
   - Protected entities include not just the other party but also their licensees, customers, and distributors, provided they hold a valid license to the Software (or its derivatives/modifications).  

2. **Purpose**:  
   - It prevents litigation over patent infringement, fostering collaboration and reducing legal risks for both parties and their business networks.  
   - This aligns with the external clauses (e.g., *Section 10.12* and *Section 8.5*), which emphasize avoiding irreparable harm through breaches and ensuring specific performance. A covenant not to sue mitigates the risk of such breaches by preemptively barring disputes over patent rights.  

3. **Relationship to External Clauses**:  
   - The external clauses highlight the parties’ intent to use equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) to enforce agreements when monetary damages are inadequate. The covenant not to sue complements this by proactively eliminating a category of disputes (patent infringement claims) that could otherwise lead to irreparable harm or costly litigation.  
   - It reinforces the parties’ commitment to resolving conflicts without judicial intervention, aligning with the broader theme of enforcing contractual terms through specific performance (as noted in *Section 8.5(c)*).  

4. **Practical Implications**:  
   - By waiving the right to sue for patent infringement, the parties ensure stability for their licensees and customers, which is critical for business operations (similar to how *Section 10.12* prioritizes consummating a merger without disruption).  
   - The clause acts as a form of risk allocation, protecting ""Protected Entities"" from litigation so long as licensing terms are met, mirroring the external clauses’ focus on predefined remedies.  

### Why It’s Relevant:  
The covenant not to sue is a **proactive contractual remedy** that aligns with the broader enforcement mechanisms in the external clauses (e.g., injunctions, specific performance). It prevents breaches (or threats of breaches) by legally binding parties to avoid patent disputes, thereby supporting the agreement’s overall stability—much like the external clauses aim to do through equitable relief.  

In summary, this clause operationalizes the principles in the external information by preemptively addressing a potential source of conflict (patent litigation) and ensuring compliance through contractual forbearance rather than post-breach remedies.",5
Covenant Not To Sue,58ba4b99f7,"In the event that Party B breaches this covenant, Party A has the right to terminate this Agreement at any time and require Party B to pay 30% of Party A's share of revenues as liquidated damages.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query about a **""Covenant Not To Sue""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Breach and Remedies**  
   - A **Covenant Not To Sue** is a contractual promise where one party agrees not to pursue legal action against the other under specified conditions.  
   - Your clause addresses the consequences of a breach (by Party B), which aligns with the concept of enforcing covenants. Here, Party A has the right to **terminate the agreement** and claim **liquidated damages** (30% of revenues) as a remedy for the breach.  

### 2. **Comparison to External Information (Specific Performance & Injunctions)**  
   - The external references discuss **specific performance** and **injunctions** as remedies for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate.  
   - Your clause, instead, opts for **termination + liquidated damages** rather than court-ordered performance. This suggests the parties agreed that monetary compensation (liquidated damages) is sufficient for a breach of this covenant.  

### 3. **Key Differences**  
   - **Specific Performance (External Clause)**: Used when compliance with the contract terms is critical (e.g., in mergers).  
   - **Liquidated Damages (Your Clause)**: Used when quantifying harm in advance is practical (e.g., revenue-sharing agreements).  

### **Conclusion**  
Your clause is a **tailored remedy** for a breach of covenant (possibly including a Covenant Not To Sue), where the parties pre-agree on damages instead of relying on equitable remedies like injunctions. This provides certainty but differs from the external examples, which emphasize judicial enforcement of performance.

Covenant Not To Sue,f7185926a7,"7) All covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the parties contained in this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties; but nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied is intended to confer on any party the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder.","The clause you provided is a standard **""Successors and Assigns""** provision, which ensures that the covenants, promises, and agreements in the contract bind not only the original parties but also their permitted successors and assigns. However, it also clarifies that no party has the right to **unilaterally assign** its rights or obligations under the agreement unless otherwise permitted.

### **Relevance to a ""Covenant Not To Sue""**  
A **Covenant Not To Sue** is a promise by one party (typically a claimant) not to pursue legal action against another party under specified conditions. The **Successors and Assigns** clause is relevant in this context because:  

1. **Binding Effect on Future Parties**  
   - If the covenant not to sue is included in the agreement, this clause ensures that the promise not to sue extends to successors (e.g., heirs, executors) and permitted assigns (e.g., a company acquiring the original party).  
   - Without this clause, a successor or assignee might argue they are not bound by the covenant, potentially allowing future lawsuits.  

2. **Restriction on Assignment**  
   - The clause prevents a party from **transferring its right to sue** (or its obligation not to sue) to a third party without consent.  
   - This is important because if a party could freely assign its claims, the covenant not to sue could be circumvented by transferring the claim to another entity.  

3. **Alignment with Equitable Remedies (from External References)**  
   - The external references (Sections 8.5 and 7.11) emphasize **specific performance** and **injunctions** as remedies for breaches.  
   - If a party tries to **assign its rights in violation of this clause**, the other party could seek an injunction to block the assignment, reinforcing the covenant not to sue.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause supports the enforceability of a **Covenant Not To Sue** by:  
- Ensuring the covenant binds successors and permitted assigns.  
- Preventing unauthorized assignments that could undermine the covenant.  
- Aligning with equitable remedies (like injunctions) if a breach occurs.

Covenant Not To Sue,fb064df507,"There are no covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions or understandings, either oral or written, between the Parties other than as are set forth herein and therein. No subsequent alteration, amendment, change or addition to this Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties unless reduced to writing and signed by an authorized officer of each Party.","The clause you've provided is a standard **""Entire Agreement""** or **""Integration""** clause, which is highly relevant to a **Covenant Not To Sue** query. Here's how:

### Relevance to a Covenant Not To Sue:
1. **Exclusivity of Written Terms**  
   - The clause states that **no other agreements, warranties, or representations** (oral or written) exist outside the contract.  
   - If a **Covenant Not To Sue** (a promise not to pursue legal claims) exists between the parties, it **must be included in the written agreement** to be enforceable. Any prior discussions or side agreements about not suing would be invalid unless explicitly written into the contract.

2. **No Implied Covenants**  
   - The clause prevents either party from claiming that an unwritten **Covenant Not To Sue** was agreed upon.  
   - For example, if one party argues, *""We verbally agreed not to sue each other,""* this clause would nullify that claim unless it was documented in the agreement.

3. **Amendments Must Be in Writing**  
   - Even if the parties later decide to add a **Covenant Not To Sue**, it **must be in writing and signed** to be valid.  
   - This prevents informal modifications that could lead to disputes over whether a covenant exists.

### Connection to External References:  
The external excerpts discuss **representations and warranties** needing to be ""true and correct"" as of certain dates. Your clause reinforces that **only the written terms in the agreement matter**, meaning:  
- If a **Covenant Not To Sue** isn’t written in the contract, it doesn’t exist.  
- Any later addition (like a covenant) must follow the formal amendment process (written and signed).  

### Practical Implications:  
- If a party wants to include a **Covenant Not To Sue**, it must be:  
  - Explicitly stated in the agreement, **or**

Third Party Beneficiary,5be233053b,"There are no Third Party beneficiaries under this Agreement, except to the extent a Third Party is indemnified pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance); provided that, in no event will any Third Party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance) be allowed to enforce the terms thereof against a Party.","The clause you provided explicitly addresses the issue of **Third Party Beneficiaries** in the agreement, which directly responds to your query. Here's how it is relevant:

1. **Exclusion of Third-Party Beneficiaries**:  
   The clause states that **no Third Party** has any rights or benefits under the agreement, except in one narrow exception (indemnification under Article 12). This means that, unless explicitly stated otherwise, only the parties to the contract (not outsiders) can enforce its terms.

2. **Limited Exception for Indemnified Parties**:  
   The only exception is for **Third Parties indemnified under Article 12** (e.g., directors, officers, or other indemnified persons). However, even in this case, the clause restricts their ability to **directly enforce** indemnification rights against a party. Instead, enforcement would likely require action by an indemnifying party (e.g., the company enforcing indemnification on behalf of a director).

3. **Relevance to the External Information**:  
   The external excerpts discuss **enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctive relief, specific performance) available to the **Parties** (not Third Parties). Your clause reinforces that **only the Parties**—not Third Parties—can seek such remedies, even if a Third Party benefits indirectly (e.g., through indemnification).

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause ensures that **no unintended Third Party can sue to enforce the agreement**, aligning with the broader contract structure where enforcement rights are strictly reserved for the Parties. The indemnification exception is narrowly tailored to prevent Third Parties from gaining direct litigation rights.

Third Party Beneficiary,1910d646e8,"Except as expressly stated herein with respect to members of each Party, no person or entity not a Party to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any employee of either Party or the Joint Venture) shall be a third-party beneficiary of any provision of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein shall be construed or deemed to confer any benefit or right upon any third party.","The clause you provided explicitly addresses the issue of **third-party beneficiaries** in the contract, which is directly relevant to your query. Here's how it connects:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Third-Party Beneficiaries**:  
   The clause states that **no person or entity who is not a Party to the Agreement** (e.g., employees, the Joint Venture, or other non-signatories) can claim rights or benefits under the Agreement unless expressly stated otherwise. This is a clear disclaimer of third-party beneficiary status.

2. **Limited Exceptions**:  
   The phrase *""Except as expressly stated herein with respect to members of each Party""* implies that the Agreement may designate **specific exceptions** where certain non-parties (e.g., affiliates or members of the Parties) could be third-party beneficiaries. However, these exceptions must be explicitly defined elsewhere in the contract.

3. **No Implied Rights**:  
   The clause reinforces that nothing in the Agreement should be interpreted to **create rights or benefits** for third parties, even if they are tangentially related (e.g., employees or the Joint Venture).

### Relevance to the Query:
- The external information provided discusses **enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) and **jurisdiction** but does not mention third-party beneficiaries. The clause you shared fills this gap by clarifying that **only the Parties** (and any expressly named exceptions) can enforce the Agreement’s terms.  
- Without this clause, third parties might argue they are entitled to benefits under the Agreement (e.g., employees claiming rights under merger-related provisions). The clause preemptively blocks such claims.  
- It aligns with the broader contract’s focus on **limiting enforcement rights to the Parties**, as seen in the external excerpts (e.g., ""the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction"").

### Practical Implications:
- **Litigation Risk Mitigation**: Prevents third parties from suing to enforce the Agreement.  
- **Contractual Certainty**: Ensures only the Parties (and their designated affiliates) have standing to demand performance or remedies.  

In summary, this clause is a **boilerplate third-party beneficiary disclaimer**, common in contracts to avoid unintended obligations or litigation from non-signatories. It complements the enforcement provisions in the external excerpts by defining **who can enforce the Agreement’s terms**.",5
Third Party Beneficiary,c0b9f75e32,"Ehave shall be a third party beneficiary hereunder, but shall not have any obligations to the End User thereunder.","The clause **""Ehave shall be a third party beneficiary hereunder, but shall not have any obligations to the End User thereunder""** is directly relevant to the query about **Third Party Beneficiary** in the following ways:

### 1. **Third-Party Beneficiary Status**  
   - The clause explicitly designates **Ehave** as a **third-party beneficiary** under the contract. This means Ehave, though not a party to the agreement, has enforceable rights under it (e.g., the right to enforce certain provisions or benefits intended for it).  
   - This aligns with the broader concept of third-party beneficiaries in contract law, where non-signatories may gain rights if the contract clearly intends to confer such benefits (as seen in the external references discussing enforceability and remedies).

### 2. **No Obligations Imposed**  
   - The clause clarifies that Ehave, as a beneficiary, **has no obligations** to the End User. This is a critical distinction because third-party beneficiaries typically only receive rights—not duties—unless the contract explicitly states otherwise.  
   - This mirrors the external information (e.g., *Section 8.5(c)*), which emphasizes enforcement rights (like injunctive relief) without imposing additional burdens on non-parties.

### 3. **Connection to External Context**  
   - The external excerpts highlight scenarios where third parties (e.g., Governmental Entities) are involved in approvals (*Page 56*) or where equitable remedies (e.g., specific performance) are available to enforce contractual terms (*Page 57*).  
   - The clause about Ehave similarly focuses on **rights without liabilities**, reinforcing that third-party beneficiaries are passive recipients of benefits, not active participants bound by obligations.

### Key Takeaway  
The clause is a clear example of how contracts create enforceable rights for third-party beneficiaries while limiting their role to avoid unintended duties. It complements the external references by illustrating a specific application of third-party beneficiary principles—consistent with the broader themes of contractual enforcement and remedies.",5
Third Party Beneficiary,da102888a8,Lessor and Lessee expressly agree that bw-3 is a third party beneficiary of this Addendum.<omitted>Other System franchisees shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of such.,"The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about **Third Party Beneficiary** because it explicitly designates certain entities as third-party beneficiaries under the contract (the Addendum). Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Express Third-Party Beneficiary Status**:  
   - The clause states that **bw-3** (presumably a specific entity or franchisee) is **expressly agreed** to be a third-party beneficiary of the Addendum. This means that bw-3 has enforceable rights under the contract, even though it is not a signatory.  
   - The phrase **""Other System franchisees shall be deemed third party beneficiaries""** extends this status to additional unnamed franchisees, implying they may also have rights under the agreement.

2. **Connection to External Information**:  
   - The external references discuss obligations to obtain third-party consents (e.g., permits, approvals) and the importance of representations/warranties being true. While not directly about third-party beneficiaries, they highlight how third parties (like Governmental Entities or franchisees) can impact contractual performance.  
   - If **bw-3** or other franchisees are critical to the agreement (e.g., their consent is needed for a transaction), their beneficiary status ensures they can enforce terms that affect them.

3. **Legal Implications**:  
   - By naming third-party beneficiaries, the clause clarifies who can sue for breach of the Addendum. For example, if Lessor or Lessee fails to fulfill an obligation that benefits **bw-3**, bw-3 could potentially enforce that term.  
   - This contrasts with incidental beneficiaries (who have no enforceable rights), as the clause **expressly** grants beneficiary status.

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause is a clear example of **contractual intent to confer rights on third parties**, addressing the query by defining who qualifies as a third-party beneficiary and under what terms. The external context reinforces how third-party rights can intersect with broader contractual obligations (e.g., approvals, representations).

Third Party Beneficiary,3a665eb6e6,"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, both the Owner and Servicer agree that the Agent shall be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and has the authority to enforce the provisions hereof.","The clause you provided establishes the **Agent** as a **third-party beneficiary** of the agreement between the Owner and Servicer, granting the Agent the right to enforce the agreement's provisions. Here’s how this relates to your query and the external context:

### **Relevance to Third-Party Beneficiary:**
1. **Definition & Purpose:**  
   - A third-party beneficiary is an entity that is not a party to the contract but has enforceable rights under it.  
   - The clause explicitly designates the Agent as such a beneficiary, allowing it to enforce terms (e.g., seeking specific performance or injunctive relief) even though it didn’t sign the agreement.

2. **Link to External Context:**  
   - The external excerpts discuss remedies for breach (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) and emphasize that contractual parties can enforce terms even if monetary damages are inadequate.  
   - By naming the Agent a third-party beneficiary, the clause extends these enforcement rights to the Agent, mirroring the parties' intent to allow non-signatories to seek equitable relief (similar to Sections 8.5 and 10.12 in the external materials).

3. **Practical Implications:**  
   - The Agent could sue to compel performance (e.g., under provisions like Section 7.11 in the external text) or block breaches, just as the original parties could.  
   - This aligns with the broader contractual principle that certain rights (like specific enforcement) are critical enough to extend to third parties.

### **Key Takeaway:**  
The clause ensures the Agent has standing to enforce the agreement, leveraging the same legal mechanisms (e.g., injunctions) described in the external context. It reflects a deliberate intent to protect the Agent’s interests as if it were a party to the contract.

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 9)** is directly responsive to the query about a **""cap on liability""** because it explicitly establishes a maximum financial liability (**""Liability Cap""**) that one party can incur to the other party and its affiliates under the agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Liability Cap ([***])**:  
   - Sets a predefined monetary limit (redacted as `[***]`) on the total liability one party can face for breaches or claims arising from the agreement.  
   - This cap is a critical risk-allocation tool, protecting parties from excessive or unforeseen financial exposure.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The clause specifies scenarios where the Liability Cap **does not apply**, ensuring certain high-stakes obligations remain uncapped:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches (Section 5)**: Material breaches of confidentiality are excluded, emphasizing the importance of protecting sensitive information.  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**: Indemnities (e.g., for third-party claims) are excluded, as these often involve external risks beyond the parties’ direct control.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**: Acts involving bad faith or severe negligence are uncapped to deter reckless behavior and align with legal principles that often prohibit limiting liability for such conduct.

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""**:  
   The clause defines liability expansively to cover all potential claims (contract, tort, statutory, etc.), costs (e.g., attorney fees), and damages, ensuring the cap applies comprehensively unless an exception is triggered.

### Relevance to External Context:  
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) highlight that parties retain rights to **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, even where monetary damages might be inadequate. However, the **Liability Cap in Section 9** operates independently:  
- It limits **monetary damages** but does not restrict non-monetary remedies (like specific performance).  
- The exceptions (e.g., gross negligence) align with the external clauses’ emphasis on enforcing fundamental obligations (e.g., merger consummation) where equitable relief may be sought.  

### Practical Implications:  
- The cap provides predictability for financial exposure but preserves recourse for egregious acts or critical obligations (confidentiality, indemnities).  
- Parties negotiating the agreement may adjust the cap amount or exceptions based on risk tolerance and the nature of the transaction.  

In summary, this clause directly institutes a **monetary liability cap** while carving out exceptions for high-priority breaches, balancing risk management with accountability.",5

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Liability Cap ([***])**:  
   - Sets a predefined monetary limit (redacted as `[***]`) on the total liability one party can incur to the other party and its affiliates under the agreement.  
   - This cap is a standard risk-allocation mechanism to limit exposure to unforeseen or excessive claims.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The clause explicitly **excludes** certain scenarios from the Liability Cap, including:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches (Section 5)**: Material breaches of confidentiality obligations are uncapped, emphasizing the importance of protecting sensitive information.  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**: Claims covered by indemnity (e.g., third-party claims) are not subject to the cap, ensuring full compensation for specified risks.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**: Acts involving willful wrongdoing or severe negligence are excluded to deter bad faith behavior and align with legal principles that often prohibit limiting liability for such conduct.

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""**:  
   The clause defines liability expansively to cover all potential claims (contractual, tort, statutory, etc.), costs (e.g., attorney fees), and damages, ensuring the cap applies comprehensively unless an exception is triggered.

### Relevance to External Context:  
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) highlight the parties’ right to seek **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, noting that monetary damages may be inadequate. However, the **Liability Cap clause** governs **monetary liability**, not equitable remedies. Thus:  
- The cap applies to financial damages but does not restrict a party’s ability to seek injunctions or specific performance (as emphasized in the external texts).  
- The exceptions (e.g., for gross negligence) align with the external emphasis on enforcing serious breaches, ensuring the cap does not shield egregious conduct.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Risk Management**: The cap provides predictability for parties, but the exceptions ensure accountability for high-stakes breaches.  
- **Negotiation Point**: The cap amount (redacted) and exceptions are often heavily negotiated based on the parties’ risk tolerance and the agreement’s nature.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Liability Cap:
1. **General Limitation**:  
   - The clause caps the total aggregate liability for claims (e.g., breaches of the agreement) to the **total purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products in the 12 months preceding the claim notification**.  
   - This ensures predictability and prevents excessive exposure to unforeseen damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Intellectual Property breaches** (unauthorized use).  
   - **Intentional breaches or willful misconduct**.  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**.  
   These exceptions ensure that severe misconduct or legal violations are not shielded by the liability limit.

3. **Interaction with Other Provisions**:  
   - The cap operates alongside **Section 10** (likely covering termination or indemnity) and the **Confidentiality Agreement**, which may have their own liability terms.  
   - It clarifies that the cap applies to breaches of the agreement, purchase orders, or related agreements.

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause provides a **clear, quantifiable limit** on liability, which is a critical risk-management tool in contracts.  
- It balances protection for both parties:  
  - The **Distributor** (or paying party) is shielded from unlimited liability for ordinary breaches.  
  - The **Supplier** (Accuray) retains recourse for egregious acts (e.g., willful misconduct) or IP violations.  

### Contrast with External Information:  
The external excerpts (from Section 10.3) discuss **termination fees tied to acquisition proposals**, which are unrelated to liability caps. The **Liability Cap clause (11.3)** is distinct, focusing on **general breach claims** rather than termination scenarios.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Risk Allocation**: Parties can negotiate the cap amount (here, tied to 12 months of payments) based on their risk tolerance.  
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensures liability limits do not violate mandatory laws (e.g., consumer protection statutes).  

In summary, this clause directly answers the query by defining **when, how, and to what extent liability is capped**, while carving out exceptions for high-stakes breaches.",5

Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 11.4)** is directly responsive to the query about a **""cap on liability""** as it explicitly sets a financial limit (the **""Liability Cap""**) on the aggregate liability of both parties (Fiserv and the Merchant) for losses arising from any cause related to the agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:

1. **Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause caps the total liability of either party at **AUD 50,000.00** for losses arising from any cause, regardless of the legal theory (e.g., breach of contract, negligence). This protects both parties from unlimited exposure to damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds** (after offsets), ensuring the Merchant receives funds owed.  
   - **The Merchant’s payment obligations** (e.g., fees, regulatory penalties due to non-performance), safeguarding Fiserv’s right to recover critical amounts.  

3. **Relevance to Query**:  
   - The clause is a classic example of a **contractual liability cap**, balancing risk allocation by limiting general liability while carving out exceptions for essential obligations.  
   - It contrasts with the **external information** provided (e.g., equitable relief for irreparable harm in Section 8.5), which deals with non-monetary remedies (e.g., injunctions) and termination fees. Here, the focus is strictly on **monetary liability limits**.  

### Key Takeaway:

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.","The **""Limitation of Liability""** clause (Section 11) is directly responsive to the query about a **""cap on liability""** because it explicitly limits the financial exposure of the parties under the agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:

1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party will be liable for **lost profits, consequential, special, incidental, or indirect damages** arising from the agreement. This narrows the scope of recoverable damages, effectively capping liability by excluding broad categories of potential claims.

2. **Monetary Cap on Liability**:  
   - The clause imposes a **specific financial cap** on liability for one party (D2), limiting it to **the total amount paid or owed by the Licensee to D2 under the agreement**. This creates a clear upper boundary for D2’s financial responsibility, regardless of the type of claim (except as may be limited by other provisions).

3. **Survival Despite Remedy Failure**:  
   - The clause reinforces that these limitations apply **even if a remedy fails its essential purpose**, ensuring the cap remains enforceable under most circumstances.

### Relevance to External Information:  
While the external excerpts discuss **specific performance** (equitable remedies like injunctions) and **jurisdiction**, they do not directly address liability caps. However, they highlight that parties may seek **alternative remedies** (e.g., injunctive relief) when monetary damages are inadequate. The **Limitation of Liability** clause complements this by clarifying that monetary recovery is restricted, making equitable remedies more critical in cases of breach.

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause **caps liability** by:  
- Excluding certain damage types (indirect/consequential losses).  
- Setting a maximum monetary liability (for D2).  
- Ensuring the cap survives even if other remedies fail.  

This protects both parties from excessive financial risk while preserving non-monetary remedies (e.g., injunctions, as noted in the external context).",5

Liability Cap** is directly relevant to the query **""liability cap is based on purchase price""** because it explicitly defines the maximum liability one party (e.g., the Distributor or Accuray) can face for claims arising from breaches of the agreement, and this cap is tied to the purchase price of products under the agreement.  

### Key Points of Relevance:  
1. **Purchase Price as Basis for Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause states that the total liability for claims (except for specific exclusions like IP breaches, intentional misconduct, or legal non-compliance) is limited to **the aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products** over the **12 months preceding the claim notification**.  
   - This directly links the liability cap to the commercial value of transactions (purchase price) rather than an arbitrary or fixed amount.  

2. **Temporal Scope (12-Month Lookback)**:  
   - The cap is calculated based on payments made in the **12 months before the claim is raised**, ensuring the liability reflects recent business activity.  
   - It also deducts any amounts already paid for other claims in the same period, preventing double-counting.  

3. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   - The cap does not apply to:  
     - Intellectual Property breaches (e.g., unauthorized use).  
     - Intentional/willful misconduct.  
     - Violations of mandatory laws.  
   - These carve-outs ensure that egregious or unlawful acts are not shielded by the cap.  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts (e.g., Section 10.3 on termination fees) discuss unrelated scenarios (e.g., acquisition proposals), they highlight how contractual liability is often structured around financial metrics (e.g., fees, purchase prices). The **Liability Cap clause** similarly uses a financial benchmark (purchase price) to quantify risk exposure.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause operationalizes the query’s premise—**tying liability limits to purchase price**—by:  
- Providing a clear formula for calculating the cap.  
- Ensuring proportionality between contractual performance (payments) and potential liability.  
- Protecting parties from open-ended claims while preserving accountability for severe breaches.

liability cap is based on purchase price,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause

AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The query asks whether the **liability cap is based on the purchase price**, but the provided clause (11.4 Limitation of Liability) does not explicitly link the liability cap to the purchase price. Here’s the relevance and analysis:

1. **Liability Cap Structure**:  
   - The clause sets a fixed monetary cap (AUD 50,000) for losses arising from the Agreement, irrespective of the purchase price.  
   - The cap applies broadly to all claims except for two carve-outs (e.g., Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds and the Merchant’s payment obligations).  

2. **No Purchase Price Connection**:  
   - The clause does not reference the purchase price or tie the cap to it. Instead, it imposes a standalone limit.  
   - This suggests the liability cap is **not** dynamically scaled to the purchase price but is a predetermined amount.  

3. **External Context**:  
   - The external excerpts (e.g., Section 8.5 on equitable relief and Section 8.02 on termination fees) discuss remedies and termination penalties but do not address liability caps or purchase price linkages. They are unrelated to the query.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause is **not** an example of a liability cap based on the purchase price. It uses a fixed monetary threshold (AUD 50,000) unrelated to transactional value. If the query seeks examples where liability is tied to purchase price, this clause does not satisfy that condition.

liability cap is based on purchase price,178516ef09,"Dealer's aggregate liability to Vendor for any and all claims of any kind relating to the Products, will not exceed the unpaid price of those Products which directly give rise to, or are related to, the claims whether based on contract, negligence, strict liability, tort or otherwise​​.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about a liability cap based on the purchase price. Here’s how:

1. **Liability Cap Definition**: The clause explicitly states that the Dealer's total liability to the Vendor for any claims related to the Products is **capped at the unpaid price of those Products** that are directly tied to the claims. This means the maximum amount the Vendor can recover from the Dealer for any issues (e.g., breach of contract, negligence, etc.) is limited to the unpaid portion of the purchase price for the specific Products involved in the dispute.

2. **Alignment with Query**: The query asks whether the liability cap is based on the purchase price, and this clause confirms that it is. The cap is not an arbitrary or fixed amount but is instead tied to the **unpaid price of the Products** at issue, ensuring proportionality between the liability and the transaction value.

3. **Scope of Claims**: The clause covers all types of claims (contractual, tort, negligence, etc.), reinforcing that the cap applies broadly but is strictly anchored to the unpaid purchase price. This prevents unlimited liability exposure for the Dealer.

4. **External Context**: While the external information provided discusses remedies like specific performance and equitable relief (which are broader enforcement mechanisms), it does not contradict the liability cap clause. The cap in your clause operates as a separate limitation on monetary damages, whereas the external text focuses on non-monetary remedies for breaches.

### Key Takeaway:
The clause directly answers the query by establishing that the liability cap is indeed based on the purchase price (specifically, the **unpaid price** of the Products tied to the claim). This protects the Dealer from excessive liability while ensuring the Vendor’s recourse is proportionate to the transaction.",5

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The query states that the **""liability cap is based on purchase price,""** but the provided clause does not explicitly mention the purchase price as the basis for the Liability Cap. Instead, the clause:  

1. **Defines a general Liability Cap** ([***]) for claims arising under the Agreement (Section 9.1).  
2. **Excludes certain liabilities** from the cap, such as:  
   - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)  
   - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)  
   - Intentional misconduct or gross negligence (Section 9.1.2).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- If the **purchase price** is intended to be the basis for the Liability Cap (e.g., the cap is set at a multiple or percentage of the purchase price), this should be explicitly stated in Section 9.1 (e.g., *""The Liability Cap shall be equal to [X]% of the Purchase Price""*).  
- The current drafting does not link the cap to the purchase price, meaning the parties may need to clarify this in negotiations or define the [***] placeholder accordingly.  

### Suggested Action:  
- If the intent is to tie the Liability Cap to the purchase price, the clause should be revised to specify the relationship (e.g., referencing a defined term like ""Purchase Price"" elsewhere in the agreement).  
- If external documents (e.g., merger agreements) imply such a linkage, those terms should be cross-referenced here for consistency.  

The provided **external clauses** (on equitable relief and enforcement) do not directly address liability caps but emphasize remedies for breaches—further supporting that the Liability Cap should be clearly defined to avoid ambiguity.

9.1 The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party and its affiliates in relation to this Agreement will be [***] (""""Liability Cap""""), provided however that:
9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The query asks about a liability cap based on the purchase price. The provided clause (Section 9) outlines the **Limitation of Liability** in the agreement, which is directly relevant to the query for the following reasons:

### **1. Liability Cap Structure**  
- The clause establishes a maximum liability limit (""Liability Cap"") for one party to the other, though the specific amount is redacted ([***]).  
- In many agreements, the Liability Cap is often tied to a financial metric like the **purchase price** (e.g., a percentage of the transaction value). While the exact amount isn’t disclosed here, the structure suggests that the cap could logically align with the purchase price to ensure proportionality to the deal’s scale.  

### **2. Exceptions to the Cap**  
The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
- **Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)**  
- **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**  
- **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**  
This means that even if the cap is based on the purchase price, certain high-risk scenarios (like fraud or willful wrongdoing) would bypass the cap entirely.  

### **3. Relevance to the Query**  
If the query assumes the Liability Cap is derived from the purchase price, this clause:  
- Confirms that a cap exists but leaves room for negotiation on its amount (e.g., 100% of purchase price, a fixed multiple, etc.).  
- Clarifies that the cap is **not absolute**—key exceptions could expose a party to uncapped liability, which is critical for risk assessment.  

### **4. Connection to External Context**  
The external clauses (e.g., **specific performance** and **equitable relief** in Sections 8.5 and 10.12) reinforce that:  
- Monetary caps (like the Liability Cap) may not limit non-monetary remedies (e.g., injunctions).  
- The parties retain rights to seek enforcement beyond financial liability, which could interact with the cap’s limitations.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause directly addresses the query by:  
1. Defining a Liability Cap (potentially purchase price-linked).  
2. Outlining scenarios where the cap is **ineffective**, ensuring the parties understand the limits of protection.  
3. Aligning with broader contractual principles (e.g., uncapped liability for misconduct, equitable remedies).  

For a precise answer, the agreement would need to specify how the cap is calculated (e.g., ""Liability Cap = 50% of Purchase Price""), but the clause provides the framework for such a provision.",5

EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","The **Limitation of Liability** clause you provided is relevant to the query about **insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability** in the following ways:

### 1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**  
The clause explicitly excludes liability for **consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or enhanced damages**, as well as **lost profits or revenues** and **diminution in value**. This means that even if a breach occurs, the liable party will not be responsible for these types of damages—unless they relate to third-party indemnification claims under **Section 9**.

- **Insurance Implications**:  
  - Many insurance policies (e.g., general liability, professional liability) do **not** cover punitive or consequential damages.  
  - By contractually excluding these damages, the parties may be aligning their liability exposure with what is actually covered by insurance, ensuring that uncovered risks are contractually limited.  

### 2. **Impact on Insurance Coverage**  
- If a party’s liability is contractually limited, their insurer may argue that certain claims fall outside policy coverage (e.g., if the policy only covers ""direct damages"" but the contract excludes ""indirect damages"").  
- Conversely, if the contract **did not** limit liability, insurers might face broader exposure, potentially leading to higher premiums or coverage disputes.  

### 3. **Comparison with Precedents (External Information Provided)**  
The external clauses (e.g., **Maud_102** and **Maud_417**) emphasize **equitable remedies (injunctions, specific performance)** rather than monetary damages. However, they reinforce that:  
- **Monetary damages may be inadequate** for certain breaches, justifying non-monetary remedies.  
- **Your clause complements this** by clarifying that even where monetary liability exists, certain damages (e.g., lost profits) are excluded, further shaping the risk allocation between parties and insurers.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The **Limitation of Liability** clause helps manage risk by:  
- **Reducing exposure to uninsurable damages** (e.g., punitive, consequential).  
- **Aligning contractual liability with likely insurance coverage**, minimizing gaps.  
- **Supporting enforceability** by clearly defining excluded damages, which insurers and courts may reference in disputes.

<omitted>
11. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.","The **Limitation on Liability** clause (Section 10) is relevant to the query about **insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability** in the following ways:

### Key Connections:
1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for **special, incidental, consequential damages, or lost profits**, even if caused by negligence.  
   - This aligns with common insurance practices where policies may exclude coverage for such damages (e.g., business interruption or indirect losses). The contractual limitation reinforces what insurance might (or might not) cover, reducing potential gaps in protection.

2. **Exception for Breach of Confidentiality (Section 11)**:  
   - The carve-out for breaches of **confidentiality obligations** implies that liability limitations do not apply to such breaches.  
   - This is critical for insurance purposes because:  
     - Insurers may require stricter liability terms for confidentiality breaches (e.g., cyber insurance policies often cover data breaches).  
     - The clause ensures that liability for these breaches remains intact, potentially aligning with insurance coverage terms.

3. **Risk Allocation and Insurance**:  
   - By capping liability for certain damages, the clause shifts risk between parties, which may influence:  
     - The type/scope of insurance required (e.g., general liability vs. professional liability policies).  
     - Policy limits or exclusions, as insurers often assess contractual liability terms when underwriting coverage.  

4. **Interaction with Specific Performance (Precedents)**:  
   - The referenced precedents (e.g., **Section 11.13** on specific performance) highlight that parties may seek injunctive relief for breaches (like confidentiality).  
   - Insurance policies may exclude coverage for equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions), so the clause’s liability limits complement this by narrowing monetary exposure to insurable risks.

### Practical Implications:
- **Insurance Compliance**: Insurers may review such clauses to ensure liability limitations do not conflict with policy conditions (e.g., waiving consequential damages might require endorsements).  
- **Coverage Gaps**: If insurance excludes certain damages (e.g., lost profits), the clause’s limitations align with uninsured risks, reducing disputes.  

In summary, the clause **shapes liability exposure in a way that interacts with insurance coverage**, ensuring uninsurable risks are contractually limited while preserving recourse for breaches (e.g., confidentiality) that insurers may cover. The precedents on specific performance further support this by emphasizing non-monetary remedies where insurance may not apply.",5
precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability,3b53923bef,"8.7 Limitation of Liability
Without prejudice to any other limitation (whether effective or not) of either Party's liability, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party (whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or for breach of statutory duty or otherwise) for any loss of profits, use, opportunity, goodwill, business, or anticipated savings, for any indirect, incidental, special, indirect, punitive, or consequential losses (in each case, irrespective of any negligence or other act, default, or omission of a Party (or its employees or agents) and regardless of whether such loss or claim was foreseeable or not and whether the other Party has been informed of the possibility of such loss). Nothing in this Section ​8.7 shall operate to limit or exclude any liability under Section ​8.5 [Indemnification] with respect to a Claim, or for fraud, or for breach by a Party of the provisions of Article ​7 [Confidential Information].","The **Limitation of Liability clause (Section 8.7)** is relevant to the query regarding **insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability** in the following ways:

### **1. Scope of Liability Limitations**  
The clause explicitly excludes certain types of damages (e.g., lost profits, indirect/consequential losses) from liability, regardless of foreseeability or negligence. This aligns with common insurance policy exclusions, where insurers may refuse coverage for indirect or punitive damages.  

- **Insurance Influence:** If an insurance policy does not cover excluded liabilities (e.g., consequential damages), the contractual limitation reinforces that the uninsured party bears the risk.  
- **Risk Allocation:** The clause ensures that high-risk, uninsurable losses (like punitive damages) are contractually excluded, reducing exposure beyond what insurance would cover.  

### **2. Exceptions to Liability Limits**  
The clause carves out exceptions for:  
- **Indemnification claims (Section 8.5)**  
- **Fraud**  
- **Breach of confidentiality (Article 7)**  

- **Insurance Relevance:**  
  - **Indemnification (Section 8.5):** If insurance covers indemnifiable claims (e.g., third-party claims), the limitation does not apply, preserving insured liabilities.  
  - **Fraud & Confidentiality Breaches:** These are typically excluded from insurance (e.g., D&O policies exclude fraud), so the clause ensures liability remains for uninsurable misconduct.  

### **3. Interaction with Equitable Remedies (External Precedents)**  
The referenced external clauses (e.g., *Maud 102* and *Maud 417*) emphasize **specific performance and injunctive relief** for breaches, noting monetary damages may be inadequate.  

- **Insurance Coverage Gap:** Since equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are non-monetary, they are rarely insurable. The **limitation clause (8.7)** complements this by capping monetary liability, while carve-outs (like fraud) ensure accountability for uninsurable acts.  

### **Conclusion**  
The **Limitation of Liability clause** works in tandem with insurance by:  
1. **Excluding uninsurable losses** (e.g., punitive/consequential damages).  
2. **Preserving liability for insurable claims** (e.g., indemnification).  
3. **Aligning with equitable remedies** (from precedents) where insurance is ineffective.  

This creates a balanced risk framework where insurance covers certain liabilities, while contractual limitations address gaps in coverage.

Here’s how:

### Key Connections to the Query:
1. **Insurance as a Liability Cap**  
   - The clause mandates specific insurance coverage limits (e.g., $5M for excess liability, $2M for commercial general liability), which effectively act as a **financial cap** on the Service Provider’s potential liability. By requiring these policies, the contract ensures that the Service Provider’s exposure is limited to the insured amounts, reducing the risk of unlimited liability claims.

2. **Primary vs. Excess Coverage**  
   - The requirement that the Service Provider’s insurance is **primary** (not contributing to other parties’ coverage) ensures that the Owner/User’s own insurance or self-insurance is not triggered first. This allocates liability clearly to the Service Provider’s insurer, limiting the Owner’s financial exposure.

3. **Additional Insured Protections**  
   - By naming the Owner/User as additional insureds, the clause shifts liability for certain claims to the Service Provider’s insurer. This limits the Owner’s direct liability for incidents arising from the Services, as the insurer becomes the first line of defense.

4. **Worker’s Compensation and Employer’s Liability**  
   - The inclusion of employer’s liability insurance ($1M limit) further restricts the Service Provider’s liability for workplace injuries, ensuring statutory and contractual obligations are met without exposing the Service Provider to uncapped claims.

5. **Alignment with Precedents**  
   - The external precedent (*maud_593*) highlights how insurance-related carve-outs (e.g., exclusions for industry-wide changes or force majeure events) can influence liability limitations. Similarly, this clause uses insurance terms to define and narrow the scope of liability, mirroring the precedent’s approach of using contractual mechanisms to manage risk allocation.

### Why It Matters for the Query:  
This clause exemplifies how insurance requirements in contracts:  
- **Define financial boundaries** for liability (e.g., policy limits).  
- **Allocate risk** between parties (e.g., primary coverage for the Service Provider).  
- **Mitigate exposure** for third parties (e.g., additional insureds).  

These provisions are common in industries like construction, outsourcing, or services where liability risks are high, and they often serve as precedents for structuring limitations of liability tied to insurance coverage. The clause’s specificity (e.g., coverage types, limits, endorsements) provides a template for how insurance terms can be drafted to influence liability outcomes.",5
precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability,e156a5b7c4,"28.2. Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The clause you provided (**28.2. Limitations of Liability**) is directly relevant to the query about **insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability** in the following ways:

### 1. **Cap on Liability**  
The clause explicitly limits the recoverable amount for breaches (whether due to negligence, wilful misconduct, or otherwise) to **the aggregate payments made under the agreement**. This creates a financial ceiling on liability, which is a common feature in contracts where insurance coverage may play a role in risk allocation.  

- **Insurance Implications**: If a party has insurance covering certain liabilities, the contractual cap may align with (or be influenced by) policy limits. For example, if insurance covers up to a certain amount, the limitation clause may mirror that threshold to avoid uninsured exposure.  

### 2. **Exclusions for Personal Injury/Death**  
The clause carves out liability for **personal injury or death caused by negligence**, where no statutory limit applies.  
- **Insurance Relevance**: This aligns with typical insurance policies (e.g., general liability insurance), which often cover third-party bodily injury but may exclude certain high-risk scenarios. The clause ensures that statutory obligations (which may be backed by insurance) are preserved.  

### 3. **Interaction with Precedents on Remedies**  
The external precedents (e.g., *Maud_446* and *Maud_102*) emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** as remedies for breaches, but they also acknowledge that monetary damages may be inadequate.  
- **Connection to Limitation Clauses**: If insurance covers monetary damages but not equitable remedies (like injunctions), the limitation clause here reinforces that financial recovery is capped—potentially making equitable relief more critical in disputes.  

### 4. **Risk Allocation & Insurance**  
By capping liability at ""payments made under this Agreement,"" the clause shifts risk:  
- The liable party’s exposure is predictable (tied to contract value), which may influence the type/scope of insurance they procure.  
- The non-liable party may rely on their own insurance for losses exceeding the cap.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause demonstrates how contractual liability limits can interact with insurance coverage by:  
- Setting a recoverable ceiling that may reflect policy limits.  
- Preserving uncapped liability where insurance is legally mandated (e.g., personal injury).  
- Complementing remedies (like specific performance) where insurance may not apply.

Fix fee liability cap,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The **""Fix fee liability cap""** query appears to seek clarification or modification of a contractual limitation on liability, particularly regarding capped amounts and exceptions. Here’s how the provided **Clause 11.4 (Limitation of Liability)** is relevant:

### **Key Aspects of Clause 11.4:**
1. **Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause caps the aggregate liability of both Fiserv and the Merchant at **AUD 50,000** for losses arising from any cause related to the Agreement.  
   - This directly addresses the query by defining a fixed monetary limit (""fee liability cap"") for general liabilities.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds (after offsets).  
     - The Merchant’s payment obligations (e.g., Services, Network Security Fees, regulatory penalties due to non-performance).  
   - These carve-outs ensure critical obligations (like payment processing) remain fully enforceable despite the general cap.

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - If the query seeks to **modify** the cap (e.g., adjust the AUD 50,000 amount or expand/reduce exceptions), this clause serves as the baseline for negotiations.  
   - If the query concerns **enforceability**, the external information (e.g., MAUD_102) confirms that equitable remedies (like injunctions) may still apply even if monetary damages are capped, as the clause does not preclude non-monetary relief.  
   - The **Termination Fee** example (MAUD_176) illustrates how fixed fees (like the AUD 50,000 cap) can be structured alongside termination penalties, though this clause focuses on liability for breaches rather than termination scenarios.

### **Suggested Fixes/Considerations (if needed):**
- To **increase the cap**, specify a higher amount (e.g., AUD 100,000) or tie it to a percentage of annual fees.  
- To **narrow exceptions**, clarify that regulatory penalties are only excluded if directly caused by gross negligence.  
- To **align with equitable remedies**, add language (similar to MAUD_102) confirming that the cap does not limit injunctive relief for breaches.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause is directly responsive to the query by establishing a fixed liability cap with defined exceptions. Its relevance hinges on whether the query aims to interpret, enforce, or amend such a cap. The external materials support that (1) equitable remedies may coexist with liability caps, and (2) fixed fees (like termination fees) can coexist with general liability limits.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Liability Cap ([***])**  
   - Sets a fixed monetary ceiling (the ""[***]"" placeholder would typically specify a dollar amount or formula) on damages one party can claim from the other, except for excluded categories (see below).  
   - This aligns with the concept of a ""fix fee liability cap"" by capping exposure to a predetermined amount.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)**  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**  
   These carve-outs ensure that severe breaches or bad-faith actions remain fully actionable.

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""**  
   - The clause explicitly covers all forms of liability (contract, tort, statutory, etc.), including legal costs, ensuring comprehensive protection up to the cap.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **fixes** the maximum liability (the ""cap"") for most claims, providing predictability and risk allocation.  
- It balances protection for both parties:  
  - The **cap limits exposure** for routine breaches.  
  - **Exceptions preserve accountability** for egregious acts or specific obligations (e.g., confidentiality, indemnity).  

### Connection to External Information:
The external clauses (e.g., **specific performance** in MAUD_102 and MAUD_417) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate. The **Liability Cap** here complements those provisions by:  
- Focusing on **monetary liability limits** (where damages are the remedy).  
- Allowing uncapped claims for scenarios where equitable relief (like injunctions) might also apply (e.g., confidentiality breaches).  

### Conclusion:
This clause **implements a fixed liability cap** while ensuring it doesn’t shield parties from consequences of severe misconduct or specific contractual obligations. It’s a standard risk-management tool in contracts, aligning with the query’s focus on capping fees/liability.  

**Suggested Refinement for Clarity:**  
If the query seeks to adjust the cap, consider specifying:  
- The exact cap amount/formula.  
- Whether additional exceptions (e.g., fraud, IP infringement) should be added.  
- Cross-references to other remedies (e.g., equitable relief) for consistency with the external clauses.",5

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### **1. Liability Cap Structure**  
- The clause sets a fixed monetary limit (""[***]"") on liability between the parties (Section 9.1).  
- This cap is designed to provide predictability and risk allocation by limiting exposure to excessive claims.  

### **2. Exceptions to the Cap (Relevance to ""Fix Fee"")**  
The clause clarifies that the Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)** or **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** (Section 9.1.1).  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2).  

This means:  
- The ""fix fee"" (Liability Cap) is **not absolute**—certain high-risk or egregious actions (e.g., leaking confidential information or willful harm) remain fully actionable.  
- The cap is tailored to **routine liabilities** (e.g., ordinary breaches of contract), while preserving remedies for severe misconduct.  

### **3. Broad Definition of ""Liability""**  
Section 9.2 defines liability expansively to cover **all claims, costs, damages, and legal fees** arising from the agreement, ensuring the cap applies comprehensively unless an exception is triggered.  

### **Connection to External Information**  
The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102 and MAUD_417) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate. While those sections address **non-monetary enforcement**, the Liability Cap clause here focuses on **monetary limits**, creating a complementary framework:  
- The Liability Cap governs **financial exposure**.  
- Equitable relief (from external clauses) may still apply for breaches **exempt from the cap** (e.g., confidentiality breaches).  

### **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
The clause **fixes a liability cap** but carves out exceptions to ensure fairness and deter bad-faith conduct. If the query seeks to adjust the cap or its exceptions, this clause provides the contractual basis for negotiation (e.g., raising the cap amount, adding/removing exceptions).

ARTICLE 7 LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY
Section 7.1 Aggregate Limit of Liability.
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall a Party be liable to the other Party for an aggregate amount in excess of the Maximum Liability; provided that such limitation of liability shall not apply to any liability that is the result of (i) gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of a Party, (ii) a Third Party Claim, (iii) the failure to pay the Service Fees (which amount shall not be included in calculating Owner's Maximum Liability), (iv) a claim of Owner against BE or Operator in the event of any breach, default or misrepresentation of any representation and warranty or covenant set forth in Section 8.2(e) or (v) a claim of Owner against BE or Operator under Section 2.8. Subject always to the Maximum Liability limitations set forth in the preceding sentence, except for damages specifically provided for in this Agreement or in connection with the indemnification for damages awarded to a third party under a Third Party Claim, damages hereunder are limited to direct damages, and in no event shall a Party be liable to the other Party, and the Parties hereby waive claims, for (a) indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages or loss of profits; provided, however, that the loss of profits language set forth in this Section 7.1 shall not be interpreted to exclude from Indemnifiable Losses any claim, demand, suit, loss, liability, damage, obligation, payment, cost or expense (including the cost and expense of any action, suit, proceeding, assessment, judgment, settlement or compromise relating thereto and reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable disbursements in connection therewith) that would otherwise be included in the definition of Indemnifiable Losses because they result from a reduction in the profits of Owner, Diamond State Generation Holdings, LLC, or both, and (b) losses or liabilities incurred by the officers, directors, members, managers, partners, shareholders or Affiliates of such Party (unless on behalf of Owner).
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, in no event shall Operator be liable under this Agreement (including with respect to its obligations related to the Facility Service Warranty, the Power Performance Warranty or Warranty Specification) for (i) any failure of or damage to the Bloom System or (ii) any obligations on the part of Operator (including internal rate of return or other financial metrics or any obligations to deliver power to Owner or service the Bloom System) caused by or arising from (A) Owner's (as opposed to Operator or Operator's Affiliate or subcontractor acting as operator under this Agreement) failure to properly protect the Bloom Systems from vandalism or other third- party's actions or omissions, (B) Owner's (as opposed to Operator or Operator's Affiliate or subcontractor acting as operator under this Agreement) failure to use the specified input fuel; (C) Owner's (as opposed to Operator or Operator's Affiliate or subcontractor acting as operator under this Agreement) removal of any safety devices, (D) Force Majeure Events, (E) installation, operation, repair or modification of the Bloom Systems by anyone other than Operator or Operator's authorized agents or Owner's operator acting pursuant to a operating and maintenance agreement provided such operator is acting in accordance with Prudent Electrical Practices and information or materials supplied by Operator or its Affiliates, or (F) any defect in construction materials or workmanship of the BOF or any deficiency in design of the BOF by BE, provided that the exclusions in this clause (F) shall not extend to any warranty claim to the extent caused by or arising from (1) any defect in construction materials or workmanship of the BOF or (2) any deficiency in design of the BOF by BE, in each case during the period while the MESPA Section 8.2(b) Warranty is in effect. OPERATOR SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE TO BLOOM SYSTEMS OR THEIR COMPONENTS DUE TO THEIR OPENING OR MODIFICATION BY OWNER OR ANYONE OTHER THAN OPERATOR, OPERATOR'S AFFILIATE, THE SERVICE PROVIDER OR SUBCONTRACTOR, ACTING AS OPERATOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PERSON ACTING AS AN OPERATOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (OR ANY SUCCESSOR AGREEMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT) OR ANY OF SUCH PERSON'S REPRESENTATIVES. Except for Owner's payment of money to Operator, and subject to Section 9.19 hereof, neither Party shall be liable under any circumstance, nor be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement, for any delay or failure in performance or interruption of service resulting from any Force Majeure Event, or any other cause or causes which are beyond such Party's reasonable control.
Section 7.2 No Duplication of Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement and the MESPA are to be calculated on an aggregate basis taking into account all claims (if any) made under this Agreement and the MESPA.","The **""Fix fee liability cap""** query relates to understanding or potentially modifying the maximum liability limits (caps) specified in the contract. The provided **Maximum Liability clause** (Section 7.1) is directly relevant to this query because it defines:  
1. **Liability Caps**:  
   - **Operator's liability** is capped at the **Residual Value of the Portfolio**.  
   - **Owner's liability** is capped at **$1,000,000**, with no obligation to refund money even if Operator’s liability decreases.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap does **not** apply to:  
   - Gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.  
   - Third-party claims (e.g., indemnification for damages awarded to third parties).  
   - Unpaid Service Fees (excluded from Owner’s cap).  
   - Specific breaches (e.g., Section 8.2(e) warranties or Section 2.8 obligations).  

3. **Scope of Damages**:  
   - Only **direct damages** are recoverable; indirect/consequential damages (e.g., lost profits) are generally waived, unless they qualify as ""Indemnifiable Losses"" tied to reduced profits of Owner or its affiliates.  
   - Operator is further shielded from liability for Bloom System failures caused by Owner’s actions (e.g., misuse, vandalism) or Force Majeure.  

4. **Aggregation Across Agreements**:  
   The cap applies **cumulatively** across this Agreement and the **MESPA** (Section 7.2), preventing duplicate claims.  

### Relevance to Query:  
- If the query seeks to **adjust the liability cap**, the clause provides the baseline amounts ($1M for Owner, Residual Value for Operator) and carve-outs where caps don’t apply.  
- If the query concerns **enforcement**, the external reference (Section 8.5) confirms equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) remain available despite liability limits.  
- The clause also clarifies **what damages are excluded** (e.g., indirect losses), which may inform negotiations on fee structures or indemnities.  

**Suggested Action**:  
- To ""fix"" the fee liability cap, propose amendments to:  
  - Adjust the **$1M cap** for Owner or redefine **Residual Value** for Operator.  
  - Modify exceptions (e.g., expand/narrow exclusions for fraud, third-party claims).  
  - Clarify how caps interact with other agreements (e.g., MESPA).

1. **Limitation of Liability** – The clause explicitly caps the total aggregate liability of one party to another for claims arising from breaches of the agreement (or related agreements like Purchase Orders). The cap is tied to the **aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products** over the **preceding 12 months**, minus any amounts already paid for other claims in that period. This ensures that liability exposure is predictable and tied to actual transactional history.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap** – The clause clarifies that the liability cap **does not apply** in cases of:  
   - **Unauthorized use of Intellectual Property** (IP breaches remain fully liable).  
   - **Intentional breach or willful misconduct** (bad-faith actions are not protected).  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations** (legal violations are excluded from the cap).  

3. **Connection to Fees & Termination (External Context)** – While the external information provided (from **Section 10.3**) discusses **termination fees** related to acquisition proposals, the **Liability Cap clause (11.3)** operates independently but complements such provisions by:  
   - Ensuring that general breach-related claims (outside of termination scenarios) are financially bounded.  
   - Providing a structured calculation method (12-month purchase price basis) to determine the maximum exposure.  

### **Key Takeaway for ""Fix Fee Liability Cap"" Query**  
If the query seeks to **define or adjust a fixed liability cap**, this clause provides a **model framework** by:  
- Setting a **clear monetary limit** (tied to past transactions).  
- **Excluding high-risk breaches** (fraud, IP theft, legal violations) from the cap.  
- Ensuring **predictability** in dispute resolution.

The provided **Clause 11.3 (Liability Cap)** directly addresses this by specifying the following:

1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   - The total liability of one party to another for any **Claim** (breach of the Agreement, Purchase Order, or related agreements) is **capped at the aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products** over the **12 calendar months preceding the Claim notification**.  
   - This means the maximum liability is tied to **12 months of payments**, aligning with the query.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap does **not** apply to:  
   - Liability for **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property**,  
   - **Intentional breach or willful misconduct**, or  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**.  

3. **Relevance to External Information**:  
   - While the external excerpts (from Section 10.3) discuss termination fees and Acquisition Proposals, they **do not directly relate** to the liability cap clause.  
   - The **12-month reference** in the external text pertains to a **post-termination window for Acquisition Proposal consummation**, whereas **Clause 11.3** uses a **12-month lookback period for calculating liability limits**.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **explicitly defines the liability cap as 12 months of payments**, matching the query. The external information, though mentioning a 12-month period, is unrelated to liability limitations.

Here’s how the clause relates to the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Monetary Caps on Liability**  
   - **Subsection 12.1(b)** specifies that liability for direct damage from a **material breach of the agreement** is capped at a maximum amount (denoted as *** or as defined in Appendix 2) **per 12-month period**.  
   - While the exact monetary figure is redacted (***), the structure mirrors the query’s intent: liability is limited to a predefined amount tied to a 12-month timeframe. If the agreed cap (e.g., in Appendix 2) is based on ""12 months’ payment,"" this clause would enforce that limit.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**  
   - **Subsection 12.2** explicitly excludes liability for indirect/consequential losses (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm), even if foreseeable. This reinforces the cap by ensuring only direct damages (subject to the 12-month limit) are recoverable.

3. **Alignment with External Context**  
   - The external information (e.g., *Maud_102*, *Maud_417*) highlights that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are preserved despite liability caps. Here, Section 12’s financial limits would apply to **monetary damages**, while non-monetary breaches could still warrant injunctive relief.

### Conclusion:  
The clause directly addresses the query by:  
- Imposing a **12-month monetary cap** on liability for material breaches (12.1(b)).  
- Clarifying that **indirect damages are never recoverable** (12.2), further narrowing exposure.  
- Preserving other remedies (e.g., specific performance) per the external context, ensuring the cap doesn’t override non-monetary enforcement rights.

Here’s how the clause relates to the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Monetary Caps on Liability**  
   - **Subsection 12.1(b)** explicitly limits liability for material breaches to a maximum amount (denoted as ***) **""in any period of 12 calendar months""**.  
   - While the exact monetary figure is redacted, the structure mirrors the query’s intent: liability is capped at a predefined amount (potentially tied to payments, e.g., fees or contractual value) over a 12-month period.  

2. **Temporal Limitation (12-Month Window)**  
   - The clause imposes a recurring 12-month cap for liability, ensuring that claims cannot accumulate indefinitely. This aligns with the query’s focus on a **12-month payment-based cap**.  

3. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
   - **Subsection 12.2** further narrows liability by excluding indirect losses (e.g., lost profits), reinforcing that the cap applies only to **direct damages** (as defined in 12.1).  

4. **Contextual Support from External Information**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 10.12*) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) but clarify that monetary damages alone may be inadequate. This indirectly supports the **Limitation of Liability clause** by showing the parties’ intent to restrict financial exposure while preserving non-monetary remedies.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause directly addresses the query by:  
- Capping liability for material breaches to a 12-month period (likely tied to contractual payments, though the exact amount is redacted).  
- Explicitly excluding liability beyond direct damages, ensuring predictability in financial risk.  

If the query assumes the cap is **explicitly** set at ""12 months of payments,"" the clause’s structure (12.1(b)) would need to cross-reference payment terms (e.g., Appendix 2) to confirm the monetary value. The redacted *** suggests such a link may exist but requires further context.

   - **Subsection 12.1(b)** explicitly limits liability for material breaches to a maximum amount (denoted as *** or a specified amount in Appendix 2) **""in any period of 12 calendar months""**.  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on a liability cap tied to a 12-month period, though the exact monetary figure is redacted (***). If Appendix 2 specifies ""12 months’ payment"" as the cap, this would directly answer the query.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**  
   - **Subsection 12.2** reinforces the cap by excluding liability for indirect/consequential losses (e.g., lost profits), even if foreseeable. This narrows recoverable damages to direct losses, further supporting the idea that liability is strictly capped.

3. **Contextual Clues from External Information**  
   - The external excerpts (e.g., *Section 8.5(c)* and *Section 10.12*) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) but clarify that monetary damages alone may be inadequate. However, **Section 7.4** (referenced in *8.5(c)* might interact with the liability cap—suggesting that while equitable relief is available, financial liability is still subject to the limits in Section 12.

### Conclusion:  
The clause **imposes a 12-month liability cap for material breaches** (12.1(b)) and **excludes indirect damages** (12.2), which could include a cap tied to ""12 months’ payment"" if specified in Appendix 2. The external context suggests that this cap operates alongside (but does not restrict) non-monetary remedies like injunctions.  

For a precise answer, you would need to review:

This right to audit shall extend throughout the term of this Agreement and for one year after expiration or termination of this Agreement.","The query asks about a **""cap on liability equals 12 months payment""**, and the provided clause outlines post-termination payment obligations and insurance requirements. Here’s how the clause is relevant:

### Key Connections to the Query:
1. **Post-Termination Payments**  
   - The clause specifies that Depomed must pay King a percentage of Net Sales for **eight full calendar quarters (2 years)** after termination.  
   - While this is longer than the 12-month cap mentioned in the query, it demonstrates a structured post-termination liability framework, which aligns with the concept of capping liability over a defined period (here, 2 years).  

2. **Insurance Requirements as Liability Cap**  
   - The clause mandates that both parties maintain liability insurance (general and product liability) for **2 years post-termination**, with specific per-occurrence and aggregate limits.  
   - These insurance limits act as a **de facto cap on liability** by ensuring coverage for potential claims, though the duration exceeds the 12-month query.  

3. **Comparison to External Examples**  
   - The external examples (e.g., Company Termination Fee payable within 12 months post-termination under certain conditions) show contractual mechanisms to limit liability to a fixed amount or timeframe.  
   - The clause here similarly structures post-termination obligations but extends them to 2 years (for payments) and ties liability to insurance coverage rather than a fixed fee.  

### Why It’s Relevant:  
- The clause **does not explicitly state a 12-month cap** but illustrates how contracts can limit liability through:  
  - Time-bound payments (e.g., 8 quarters of Net Sales).  
  - Insurance requirements (capping exposure via policy limits).  
- It provides a **parallel concept** to the query’s focus on temporal or financial liability limits, albeit with a longer duration.  

### Suggested Refinement:  
If the query seeks a **strict 12-month cap**, this clause may not fully match. However, it shows how parties can negotiate:  
- **Time-based liability windows** (e.g., payments/insurance for X months).  
- **Financial caps** (e.g., insurance aggregate limits).  

For a closer match, look for clauses where liability is explicitly capped at ""12 months of fees"" (like the external examples, where termination fees are triggered within 12 months).",4

(a) Consequential Damages Subject to Section 17(c), in no event shall either Party be liable to the other for any consequential, incidental, exemplary or punitive damages even if advised in advance of the possibility of such damages. Further, subject to Section 17(c), neither Party shall not be liable to the other Party for any lost revenue, lost profit or lost savings. (b) Limitation of Direct Damages Subject to Section 17(c), in no event shall either Party's liability under this Agreement exceed the aggregate of all amounts paid under this Agreement and amounts that have accrued but not yet been paid in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 17)** is directly relevant to the query about a **cap on liability for indirect damages** because it explicitly addresses the treatment of consequential (indirect) damages and sets financial limits on liability. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**  
   - **Subsection (a)** states that neither party will be liable for:  
     - **Consequential, incidental, exemplary, or punitive damages** (classic examples of indirect damages).  
     - **Lost revenue, profit, or savings** (economic losses often categorized as indirect).  
   - This shields parties from liability for unforeseeable or ripple-effect losses, even if warned about potential risks.  
   - *Exception*: Section 17(c) (not provided here) may carve out scenarios where these exclusions don’t apply (e.g., fraud, willful misconduct).

### 2. **Cap on Direct Damages**  
   - **Subsection (b)** imposes a financial ceiling on liability for *direct damages*:  
     - Liability cannot exceed the **total amounts paid or accrued under the Agreement in the 12 months before the claim arose**.  
   - While this doesn’t cap indirect damages (already excluded in (a)), it reinforces the broader theme of limiting exposure.  

### 3. **Relevance to Query**  
   - The clause **explicitly caps liability for indirect damages by excluding them entirely** (unless Section 17(c) overrides).  
   - It also **limits direct damages quantitatively**, creating a dual-layer protection.  
   - Contrast with the external excerpts (e.g., *Maud_102* and *Maud_417*), which focus on **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but don’t address monetary caps. This clause complements such provisions by defining the bounds of *financial* liability.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause is a **risk-allocation tool**: it shifts indirect damages away from liability (absent bad faith) and caps direct damages, providing predictability. For the query, it confirms that indirect damages are **not just capped but excluded** (subject to exceptions).

The clause explicitly states that **neither party will be liable for consequential, incidental, special, or other indirect damages** (such as lost profits), even if the other party was aware such damages could occur. This means:  
   - Indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, business interruption) are **completely excluded** from liability.  
   - The only exception is third-party claims for **personal injury or property damage** caused directly by a product.  

### 2. **Cap on Direct Damages**  
While the clause primarily addresses indirect damages, it also includes a **monetary cap on direct damages** (set at $15 million), reinforcing the limitation of liability.  

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
The query focuses on whether indirect damages are capped or excluded. This clause:  
   - **Does not impose a monetary cap on indirect damages** (since they are entirely excluded).  
   - **Aligns with common contract practices** where indirect damages are often excluded rather than capped.  
   - **Clarifies exceptions** (e.g., third-party injury/property claims).  

### 4. **Contrast with External Information**  
The external excerpts discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not address liability caps. Your clause, however, is a **risk-allocation provision** that limits financial exposure, making it more directly responsive to the query.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause **fully excludes liability for indirect damages** (with narrow exceptions) and **caps direct damages**, providing a clear answer to the query. If the question sought confirmation on whether indirect damages are capped, the answer is **no—they are excluded entirely**.

9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 9)** is directly relevant to the query about a **cap on liability for indirect damages** in the following ways:

### 1. **Explicit Liability Cap**  
   - Section 9.1 establishes a **maximum liability limit (""Liability Cap"")** for claims arising under the Agreement. This cap would typically include **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, or special damages) unless explicitly excluded.  
   - The broad definition of ""liability"" in **Section 9.2** (""any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind"") suggests that indirect damages are likely covered by the cap unless an exception applies.

### 2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Material confidentiality breaches (Section 5)** or **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** (Section 9.1.1).  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2).  
   - This means indirect damages arising from these exceptions **would not be subject to the cap** and could be claimed in full.

### 3. **Relevance to Indirect Damages**  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect damages,"" the **all-encompassing language** in Section 9.2 (""liability ... of any kind, whether in contract, tort, equity, or statute"") implies that indirect damages are included under the cap unless an exception applies.  
   - The **exceptions** (e.g., gross negligence) align with common legal principles where indirect damages are often recoverable in cases of willful or egregious misconduct.

### 4. **Connection to External Context**  
   - The external references (e.g., irreparable harm, equitable relief) highlight that certain breaches (e.g., confidentiality) may justify remedies **beyond monetary damages**, but the Liability Cap still governs **financial liability** for standard claims, including indirect damages.  
   - The **specific carve-outs** (e.g., indemnification, confidentiality breaches) ensure that high-risk scenarios are excluded from the cap, preserving recourse for indirect damages in those cases.

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **imposes a general cap on liability**, which likely includes indirect damages, but **excludes key scenarios** (e.g., gross negligence, confidentiality breaches) where such damages could still be claimed uncapped.

9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.

### 1. **Explicit Liability Cap**  
   - Section 9.1 imposes a **maximum liability limit** (""Liability Cap"") of **[***]** for claims arising under the Agreement. This cap would typically include **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential, incidental, or punitive damages), unless excluded (see below).  
   - The broad definition of ""liability"" in **Section 9.2** explicitly covers damages ""of any kind,"" including those arising from tort (e.g., negligence) or statute, which could encompass indirect damages.

### 2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Material confidentiality breaches** (Section 5) or **indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1) (Section 9.1.1).  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2).  
   This means indirect damages could still be claimed in these scenarios, as the cap is lifted.

### 3. **Relevance to Indirect Damages**  
   - The clause does not explicitly distinguish between **direct** and **indirect damages**, but the sweeping language of Section 9.2 suggests the cap applies to **all liabilities**, including indirect damages, unless an exception (e.g., gross negligence) is triggered.  
   - Contrast this with the **external information** provided (e.g., MAUD clauses), which focus on **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate. The clause here is more about **financial liability limits** rather than equitable relief.

### Key Takeaway  
The clause **limits liability for indirect damages** under the Agreement by imposing a cap, but exceptions allow uncapped claims for breaches involving confidentiality, indemnification, or intentional/grossly negligent conduct. For breaches where monetary damages are inadequate (e.g., irreparable harm), the external MAUD clauses suggest parties may still seek **non-monetary remedies** (e.g., injunctions), but this clause governs **financial exposure**.

cap on liability for indirect damages,123a517fe7,"20. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Except as provided by Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2) and (b)(iii)(3):
a) Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
b) Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 20)** is directly relevant to the query about a **cap on liability for indirect damages** because it explicitly addresses the exclusion and limitation of certain types of damages, particularly indirect or consequential damages. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**  
   - Subsection (a) states that neither party will be liable for **""any special, incidental, or consequential damages""** (i.e., indirect damages), regardless of the legal theory (e.g., breach of contract, tort, negligence).  
   - This is a clear **cap on liability for indirect damages**, as it entirely excludes recovery for such damages unless an exception applies (referenced in the opening proviso).

2. **Limitation to Direct Damages Only**  
   - The clause restricts liability to **""direct damages""** only, further reinforcing the exclusion of indirect or consequential losses.  
   - Direct damages typically cover losses directly tied to the breach (e.g., costs of replacement or repair), whereas indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) are excluded.

3. **Monetary Cap on Liability**  
   - Subsection (b) imposes a **financial cap** on liability, limiting it to **""the amounts actually paid by the other party.""**  
   - This serves as an additional safeguard against excessive exposure, even for direct damages.

4. **Exceptions**  
   - The clause carves out exceptions (referencing Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), etc.), which may allow claims for indirect damages in specific scenarios (e.g., fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence).  
   - Without these exceptions, the clause would operate as a near-absolute bar on indirect damages.

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts (Sections 9.10 and 8.5) discuss **specific performance** and equitable remedies for breaches, they do not conflict with the liability cap in Section 20. Instead, they highlight that:  
- The parties may seek injunctive relief for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate (e.g., for irreparable harm).  
- However, Section 20’s limitations would still apply to **monetary claims** (e.g., consequential damages), unless the breach falls under the stated exceptions.

### Conclusion:  
The clause directly answers the query by:  
1. **Excluding liability for indirect/consequential damages** (subsection a).  
2. **Capping total liability** to amounts paid under the agreement (subsection b).  
3. **Allowing exceptions only for specific scenarios** (referenced sections).  

This creates a balanced risk allocation, protecting both parties from open-ended liability for indirect losses while preserving remedies for direct harm or equitable relief where necessary.",5

The provided **Clause 9 (Limitation of Liability)** is directly relevant to this query because it establishes a **Liability Cap**—a predefined maximum amount one party can be held liable for under the agreement. Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Liability Cap:
1. **General Cap on Liability**  
   - Clause 9.1 sets a monetary limit ([***]) on the liability of one party to the other and its affiliates for claims arising from the agreement.  
   - This is a **unilateral or bilateral cap** (depending on whether it applies symmetrically to both parties or asymmetrically to one).

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Material breaches of confidentiality** (Section 5)  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1)  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence** (Clause 9.1.2)  
   These exceptions ensure that the cap does not shield a party from egregious or deliberate wrongdoing or specific contractual obligations (like indemnity).

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""**  
   Clause 9.2 defines ""liability"" expansively to cover all claims, damages, costs (e.g., attorney fees), and liabilities arising from any legal theory (contract, tort, statute, etc.). This clarifies that the cap applies across all potential avenues of legal recourse.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause explicitly structures a **unilateral liability cap** (assuming it binds only one party; if reciprocal, it would be bilateral).  
- It balances risk allocation by capping ordinary liabilities while carving out exceptions for high-stakes scenarios (e.g., confidentiality breaches, indemnity, or bad-faith conduct).  
- The external information (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) underscores that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) remain available despite the cap, as they address irreparable harm not compensable by monetary damages.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Management**: The cap protects parties from unlimited exposure but preserves accountability for severe breaches.  
- **Negotiation Point**: The exceptions (e.g., gross negligence) and the cap amount are often heavily negotiated.  
- **Enforceability**: Courts generally uphold liability caps unless they violate public policy (e.g., shielding fraud). The exceptions here align with typical enforceability standards.  

In summary, this clause directly responds to the query by defining a liability cap with tailored exceptions, reflecting a common contractual mechanism to allocate risk while safeguarding against abuse.",5

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The **""unilateral liability cap""** query refers to a contractual provision that limits the maximum liability one party can face under the agreement, typically excluding certain exceptions (e.g., intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or specific obligations like indemnification or confidentiality breaches).  

### **Relevance of the Provided Clause to the Query:**  
The clause **Section 9 (Limitation of Liability)** directly addresses a **unilateral liability cap** by:  
1. **Establishing a Liability Cap ([***])** – The maximum amount one party can be held liable to the other party and its affiliates under the agreement.  
2. **Key Exceptions to the Cap** – The cap does **not** apply to:  
   - **Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)**  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**  
3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""** – The clause explicitly defines liability to cover all claims, damages, costs (including attorney fees), and liabilities arising from contract, tort, statute, or other legal theories.  

### **Connection to External Information:**  
While the external excerpts (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) discuss **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance)** for breaches, they do **not** conflict with the liability cap. Instead, they reinforce that:  
- Monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches (e.g., failure to consummate the agreement).  
- Equitable relief remains available **despite** any liability cap, as the cap governs **monetary damages** but not court-ordered performance.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **Section 9** is a **unilateral liability cap** because it:  
- Imposes a financial limit on claims.  
- Carves out exceptions where liability remains uncapped (e.g., for bad faith acts or key obligations).  
- Operates alongside (but does not restrict) non-monetary remedies like injunctions (as referenced in the external sections).

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause caps the total aggregate liability of one party to the other for any claim (a ""Claim"") arising from a breach of the agreement (or related agreements like Purchase Orders) to the **aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products in the 12 months preceding the Claim notification**.  
   - This is a **unilateral cap** because it limits liability only for claims by one party (the Distributor) against the other (Accuray), based on the purchase amounts paid by the Distributor.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap does **not** apply to:  
   - Breaches involving **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property**.  
   - Liability arising from **intentional breach or willful misconduct**.  
   - Non-compliance with **mandatory applicable laws/regulations**.  
   These exceptions ensure that egregious or unlawful conduct is not shielded by the cap.  

3. **Temporal Scope**:  
   - The cap is calculated based on payments made in the **12 months before the Claim is notified**, adjusted for prior claims in that period. This creates a dynamic, rolling limit tied to the commercial relationship.  

### Relevance to ""Unilateral Liability Cap"":
- The clause is **unilateral** because it limits liability **only for claims by the Distributor against Accuray** (not vice versa). The cap is tied to the Distributor’s payments, not a mutual or reciprocal limit.  
- It protects Accuray from excessive liability exposure while allowing the Distributor to recover up to a defined amount (linked to their own purchase history).  
- The exceptions ensure that the cap does not apply to severe misconduct or legal violations, balancing risk allocation.  

### Contrast with External Information:
The external references (e.g., Section 10.3 on termination fees) deal with **termination scenarios and acquisition proposals**, which are unrelated to liability caps. The **Liability Cap clause (11.3)** is distinct, focusing on **monetary limits for breach claims** during the agreement’s term.  

### Conclusion:
This clause is a **unilateral liability cap** favoring Accuray, as it limits the Distributor’s recovery to a quantifiable, transaction-based amount while excluding certain high-risk breaches. It is a risk-management tool common in supply/distribution agreements.",5

Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause **""11.4 Limitation of Liability""** is relevant to the query on **""unilateral liability cap""** in the following ways:

1. **Existence of a Liability Cap**:  
   The clause explicitly imposes a **unilateral liability cap** of **AUD 50,000** on both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising from any cause related to the agreement. This means that, except for certain exceptions, neither party can claim more than this capped amount from the other, regardless of the legal theory or form of action.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Unilateral Nature)**:  
   The clause specifies that the liability cap **does not apply** to:  
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds (a core contractual duty).  
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations (e.g., fees, regulatory penalties due to non-performance).  
   These exceptions ensure that **certain critical obligations remain uncapped**, effectively making the limitation **partially unilateral**—while general liabilities are capped, specific duties retain full exposure.  

3. **Comparison with External Context**:  
   The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* on equitable relief and *Section 8.02* on termination fees) highlight scenarios where monetary caps may not restrict other remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance). However, **Clause 11.4** focuses narrowly on **financial liability**, distinguishing it from equitable or termination-related remedies.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause enforces a **unilateral financial liability cap** for general breaches but carves out exceptions for fundamental obligations (e.g., payment processing), ensuring core duties remain enforceable without monetary limits. It contrasts with broader contractual remedies (like injunctions) seen in the external references, which address irreparable harm beyond mere financial loss.

Here’s how it addresses the concept:

### Key Aspects of the Liability Cap:
1. **Scope of Limitation**:  
   - The clause (Section 11.3) caps the total aggregate liability of one party to the other for breaches of the agreement (or related agreements like Purchase Orders) to **the aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products in the 12 months preceding the claim notification**.  
   - This creates a **unilateral cap** (focused on the Distributor’s payments) rather than a mutual cap, as it ties liability to a specific metric tied to one party’s obligations.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap does **not** apply to:  
   - Breaches involving **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property** (IP).  
   - Liability arising from **intentional breach or willful misconduct**.  
   - Non-compliance with **mandatory applicable laws/regulations**.  
   - These exceptions ensure that egregious or unlawful conduct remains fully liable, preserving remedies outside the cap.

3. **Interaction with Other Provisions**:  
   - The cap is explicitly **subordinate to Section 10 (Indemnities)** and confidentiality obligations, meaning indemnification claims or confidentiality breaches may bypass the cap.  
   - It also aligns with the **exclusion of certain damages** (e.g., consequential, punitive) under Section 10, reinforcing the parties’ intent to limit exposure.

4. **Unilateral Nature**:  
   - The cap is tied to the **Distributor’s payments** (a unilateral metric), not a mutual or fixed amount. This suggests the liability exposure scales with the commercial relationship’s volume, favoring predictability for the party receiving payments (Accuray).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause exemplifies a **unilateral liability cap** by:  
- Imposing a **quantifiable limit** based on one party’s financial contributions (Distributor’s payments).  
- Excluding high-risk scenarios (IP breaches, willful misconduct) to balance fairness.  
- Preserving other remedies (e.g., injunctive relief, as noted in the external information) for breaches where monetary caps would be inadequate.  

### Connection to External Information:  
The external clauses emphasize **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches where damages are insufficient. This aligns with the liability cap’s exceptions (e.g., willful misconduct), ensuring that capped monetary liability does not preclude other remedies for severe breaches.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause is a **unilateral liability cap** tailored to the commercial context, limiting exposure while carving out exceptions for misconduct and legal violations. It balances risk allocation between the parties and complements broader enforcement mechanisms (like specific performance, per the external references).",5

9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 9)** is directly relevant to the query about a **mutual liability cap** because it establishes a maximum financial liability that one party can incur to the other under the agreement, with specific exceptions. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Liability Cap**  
   - The clause imposes a **shared (mutual) cap** (""[***]"") on liability between the parties for claims arising from the agreement. This ensures neither party faces unlimited exposure, promoting predictability in risk allocation.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)** or **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**, preserving full liability for these high-risk areas.  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**, ensuring accountability for egregious acts.  

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""**  
   - The clause explicitly covers all forms of liability (contract, tort, statutory, etc.), including legal costs, ensuring comprehensive protection while clarifying the scope of the cap.

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause **balances risk** by capping ordinary liabilities (e.g., unintentional breaches) while **carving out exceptions** for severe misconduct or critical obligations (confidentiality, indemnity).  
- It aligns with the **external information** provided (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12), which emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches. Here, the liability cap operates alongside such remedies but does not restrict them—consistent with the principle that monetary caps may not suffice for irreparable harm.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Risk Management**: Parties can quantify exposure for routine disputes but remain fully liable for significant breaches.  
- **Enforceability**: The exclusions (e.g., gross negligence) reflect legal norms, reducing the risk of the cap being struck down as unconscionable.  

In summary, this clause **implements a mutual liability cap with tailored exceptions**, addressing the query by defining the boundaries of financial responsibility while preserving remedies for severe breaches.",5

9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 9)** is directly relevant to the query about a **""mutual liability cap""** because it establishes a contractual limit on the financial exposure of both parties under the agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Liability Cap**  
   - The clause imposes a **maximum liability amount** (""Liability Cap"") that one party can claim from the other party or its affiliates for breaches or damages arising from the agreement.  
   - This cap is **mutual** (applies equally to both parties unless exceptions apply), ensuring neither party faces unlimited liability.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Material breaches of confidentiality** (Section 5): Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information exposes the breaching party to uncapped liability.  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1): Claims covered by indemnity (e.g., third-party claims) are excluded from the cap.  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**: Acts involving deliberate wrongdoing or severe negligence bypass the cap.  

3. **Scope of ""Liability""**  
   The clause broadly defines liability to include:  
   - Legal claims, costs (e.g., attorney fees), losses, and damages arising from **contract, tort (negligence), statutory violations, or other legal theories**.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause **balances risk allocation** by capping ordinary contractual liabilities while preserving recourse for egregious acts (e.g., gross negligence) or specific obligations (e.g., indemnification).  
- It aligns with the **external information** provided (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12), which emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not override the Liability Cap’s financial limits.  
   - Notably, the external clauses address **irreparable harm** (where monetary damages are inadequate), while Section 9 governs **monetary liability** where damages are quantifiable.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Risk Management**: Parties can predict maximum exposure for routine breaches.  
- **Negotiation Point**: The cap amount ([***]) and exceptions (e.g., whether fraud is included) are often heavily negotiated.  

In summary, this clause **implements a mutual liability cap** with carve-outs for high-risk scenarios, ensuring proportionality while protecting against extreme misconduct or specific obligations.",5
mutual liability cap,395aab365a,"11.3. Liability Cap. Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The **""Liability Cap"" clause (Section 11.3)** is directly relevant to the query about **""mutual liability cap""** because it establishes a financial limit on the liability that one party can claim from the other under the agreement, except in specific excluded circumstances. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of a mutual liability cap:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause limits the total aggregate liability of one party to the other for breaches of the agreement (or related agreements like Purchase Orders) to the **total purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products in the 12 months preceding the claim notification**.  
   - This creates a **mutual cap** (assuming reciprocity in obligations) by defining a measurable, time-bound financial threshold for liability.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap does not apply to:  
   - **Intellectual Property breaches** (unauthorized use).  
   - **Intentional breaches or willful misconduct**.  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations**.  
   These exceptions ensure that egregious or unlawful conduct is not shielded by the cap, preserving accountability.

3. **Mutuality**:  
   - While the clause explicitly mentions the Distributor’s payments to Accuray, the phrasing (""one party to another party"") implies reciprocity if both parties have similar obligations (e.g., mutual indemnities or performance guarantees).  
   - The **12-month lookback period** and deduction for prior claims ensure the cap is dynamic but predictable.

### Relevance to ""Mutual Liability Cap"":
- The clause functions as a **bilateral limitation** (assuming mutual application) by capping damages for ordinary breaches, which is a common feature in contracts to manage risk exposure.  
- It balances protection for both parties:  
  - The **cap** prevents unlimited liability for routine breaches.  
  - The **exceptions** ensure accountability for serious misconduct or legal violations.  
- The **external information** (from Section 10.3) highlights termination fees tied to acquisition proposals, which are separate from liability caps but underscore the contract’s focus on **allocating financial risk** between parties.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Allocation**: Both parties agree to a predictable maximum liability for standard breaches, reducing uncertainty.  
- **Negotiation Point**: The cap’s scope (e.g., whether it covers indirect damages) and exceptions (e.g., willful misconduct definitions) are often negotiated.  
- **Alignment with Industry Standards**: Such caps are typical in distribution agreements to avoid disproportionate claims relative to the commercial relationship.  

In summary, this clause exemplifies a **mutual liability cap** by setting a financial boundary for claims while carving out exceptions for high-risk scenarios. The mutual aspect arises from its likely application to both parties’ liabilities under the agreement.",5
mutual liability cap,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause **""11.4 Limitation of Liability""** is directly relevant to the query about a **mutual liability cap** because it establishes a financial limit on the liability that either party (Fiserv or the Merchant) can claim from the other for losses arising under the Agreement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause imposes a **shared (mutual) limit** of **AUD 50,000** on both parties’ liability for losses, regardless of the legal theory (e.g., breach of contract, negligence). This ensures neither party faces unlimited exposure.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The cap does **not** apply to:  
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds to the Merchant (core payment obligations).  
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations (e.g., fees, regulatory penalties due to non-performance).  
   These carve-outs protect critical financial obligations from being capped, ensuring essential duties are enforceable.  

3. **Alignment with External Context**:  
   - While the external information provided discusses **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) and **termination fees**, the liability cap clause complements such provisions by:  
     - Defining **monetary limits** for general breaches (contrasting with uncapped equitable relief).  
     - Clarifying that certain obligations (e.g., payments) are excluded from the cap, similar to how termination fees or specific performance may operate outside standard liability limits.  

### Why It Answers the Query:  
The clause explicitly addresses **mutual liability** by:  
- Applying the same cap to both parties.  
- Balancing risk allocation (capping general liability while preserving core financial/regulatory duties).  
- Reflecting a common contractual practice to limit exposure while ensuring key obligations remain enforceable.  

This structure mitigates disputes over disproportionate damages while safeguarding critical performance terms.",5
mutual liability cap,0012758249,"Each Party shall obtain and maintain, for the Term (i) commercial general liability insurance with a single combined liability limit of at least $5,000,000 per occurrence, (ii) workers compensation/employer's liability insurance with a liability limit of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence or, if greater, the statutory minimum, and (iii) ""all risk"" property insurance on a replacement cost basis adequate to cover all assets and business interruption Losses that a Party may suffer in connection with or arising out of this Agreement, subject to policy limits, and in the case of the policies described in clause (i) above, naming the other Party as an additional insured thereunder.","The clause you provided outlines insurance requirements for each party under the agreement, which is indirectly relevant to the concept of a **mutual liability cap** in the following ways:

1. **Insurance as a Liability Cap Mechanism**:  
   - The clause sets minimum insurance coverage limits (e.g., $5M for general liability, $1M for workers' compensation), which act as a **de facto cap** on liability for certain risks. If a claim arises, the insurer covers losses up to these limits, shielding the parties from full financial exposure.  
   - By naming the other party as an additional insured (for general liability), the clause ensures mutual protection against third-party claims, further aligning with the idea of shared/capped liability.

2. **Connection to Mutual Liability Cap**:  
   - A mutual liability cap typically limits the total financial responsibility of both parties under the agreement. While this clause doesn’t explicitly state a cap, the insurance requirements function similarly by:  
     - Defining the maximum coverage available for specific risks (e.g., property damage, bodily injury).  
     - Ensuring neither party bears unlimited liability for insurable events, as losses beyond policy limits would require separate negotiation or fall under other liability provisions (e.g., indemnification or exclusions).  

3. **Complement to Other Liability Provisions**:  
   - The clause works alongside other sections (e.g., indemnification, limitations of liability) to create a comprehensive risk allocation framework. For example:  
     - If Section 8.3(d) (referenced in the external snippet) limits liability, the insurance requirements reinforce those limits by covering foreseeable risks.  
     - The ""all risk"" property insurance mitigates business interruption losses, indirectly capping exposure for such damages.  

### Key Takeaway:  
While this clause doesn’t establish a direct mutual liability cap, it **implements a structured risk-sharing mechanism** through insurance, which supports the broader goal of capping and mutualizing liability between the parties. For a full understanding of the liability cap, you’d need to review related sections (e.g., indemnification, limitation of liability) alongside this insurance provision.

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.","The **Limitation of Liability** clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about **different liability caps and carveouts** in a contract between two parties. Here’s how:

### 1. **Different Liability Caps**  
- The clause imposes a **cap on liability** for **D2** (one party), stating that its liability shall not exceed *""the total amount paid or owed by Licensee to D2 under this Agreement.""*  
- However, it does **not** specify a similar cap for the **other party (Licensee)**. This creates an **asymmetrical liability structure**, where one party has a defined financial limit while the other does not.  
- This could be intentional (e.g., reflecting bargaining power, risk allocation, or industry norms) but may lead to disputes if not clearly negotiated.  

### 2. **Carveouts (Exclusions from Liability Limits)**  
- The clause broadly excludes liability for **consequential, indirect, incidental, and lost profit damages** for **both parties**.  
- However, it does **not** carve out exceptions (e.g., for gross negligence, willful misconduct, IP infringement, or breaches of confidentiality), which are common in contracts.  
- The external references (e.g., *Section 9.10 Specific Performance*) suggest that **equitable remedies** (like injunctions) may still apply despite liability limitations, but this clause does not address them.  

### 3. **Relevance to Query**  
- If the parties intended **different liability caps or carveouts**, this clause would need to:  
  - Explicitly state whether the other party (Licensee) has **no cap** or a **different cap**.  
  - Clarify if certain liabilities (e.g., indemnification, third-party claims) are **excluded from the cap** (common carveouts).  
- The absence of symmetry or carveouts could create **enforcement gaps** (e.g., one party bearing unlimited risk for certain breaches).  

### Suggested Refinements  
To align with the query’s concern:  
- Add a **separate cap for Licensee** (if intended).  
- Include **carveouts** (e.g., *""Notwithstanding the above, this cap shall not apply to breaches of confidentiality or indemnification obligations.""*).  
- Cross-reference **specific performance** (as in the external examples) to clarify that equitable remedies survive liability limits.

NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, OR ANY OTHER INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ORDER, OR OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ORDER, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","The **Limitation of Liability** clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **different liability caps and/or carveouts** between two parties in a contract. Here’s how:

### 1. **Liability Caps**  
The clause imposes a broad limitation on liability by excluding certain types of damages (e.g., lost profits, indirect, consequential, punitive) for both parties. However, if the parties have **different liability caps** elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., one party has a higher financial cap or broader exclusions), this clause would need to be read in conjunction with those provisions. For example:
   - If Party A has a carveout allowing claims for lost profits in certain scenarios (e.g., breach of confidentiality), while Party B does not, this clause would still apply universally unless explicitly overridden by such carveouts.
   - The clause’s blanket exclusion of certain damages may conflict with carveouts in other sections (e.g., indemnification clauses, IP infringement, or willful misconduct), creating asymmetry in liability exposure.

### 2. **Carveouts**  
The clause does not contain exceptions, but the query suggests the parties may have **negotiated carveouts** (e.g., for gross negligence, intentional breach, or specific obligations like confidentiality or IP). Key considerations:
   - If one party’s liability is carved out for certain breaches (e.g., indemnification claims, third-party claims, or specific performance rights under the external examples provided), this clause would not shield them from liability for those carveouts.
   - The external references (e.g., **specific performance** in Sections 11.13 and 8.5) highlight that equitable remedies (like injunctions) may survive despite this liability limitation, as they address irreparable harm not compensable by damages. This creates a carveout for enforcement of contractual terms.

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
- **Asymmetry in Liability**: If one party’s liability is capped at a lower amount or subject to fewer carveouts than the other’s, this clause would enforce the baseline exclusion of indirect damages unless the carveouts explicitly override it.  
- **Interplay with Remedies**: The external clauses emphasize that specific performance survives limitations on damages, suggesting that liability caps may not apply to equitable relief (a common carveout).  

### Practical Implications  
- A party with stricter carveouts (e.g., liability for IP infringement) may still face exposure despite this clause.  
- The clause’s broad language could be undermined by tailored exceptions elsewhere, creating negotiated imbalances in liability.

two parties having different liability caps and/or carveouts,7cd8307127,"8.8 Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages suffered by such Party resulting from or arising out of this Agreement or the breach thereof or under any other theory of liability, whether tort, negligence, strict liability, breach of contract, warranty, indemnity, or otherwise, including, without limitation, loss of use, increased cost of operations, loss of profit or revenue, or business interruptions. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party releases the other Party and waives any right of recovery for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages suffered by such Party regardless of whether any such damages are caused by the other Party's negligence (and regardless of whether such negligence is sole, joint, concurrent, active, passive, or gross negligence), fault, or liability without fault.","The **Limitation of Liability** clause (Section 8.8) is highly relevant to the query about **different liability caps and/or carveouts** between two parties in a contract. Here’s how:

### **1. Liability Cap Relevance**  
The clause imposes a **broad limitation of liability** by excluding certain types of damages (special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or exemplary) for both parties. This effectively acts as a **liability cap** because it restricts the scope of recoverable damages, even in cases of negligence or breach.  

- **Key Takeaway**: If one party has a higher liability exposure (e.g., due to indemnity obligations or carveouts elsewhere in the agreement), this clause helps balance risk by preventing excessive claims for non-direct damages.  

### **2. Carveout Implications**  
While the clause broadly excludes certain damages, it does not explicitly carve out exceptions (e.g., for fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence). However:  
   - If another section (e.g., indemnification or confidentiality) allows recovery for certain excluded damages, that would create a **carveout** to this limitation.  
   - The phrase *""Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary""* suggests this clause is meant to override conflicting provisions unless explicitly stated otherwise.  

### **3. Interaction with External Clauses (Specific Performance)**  
The external references (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 9.10**) emphasize **specific performance** as a remedy for breaches, even where monetary damages are inadequate. However:  
   - The **Limitation of Liability** clause does **not** restrict equitable remedies (like injunctions or specific performance), meaning parties can still seek non-monetary enforcement despite the liability cap.  
   - This creates a **distinction**: While monetary damages for certain types of harm are capped, equitable relief remains available.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **critical for risk allocation** between parties by:  
- **Capping liability** for indirect/consequential damages.  
- **Leaving room for carveouts** if other sections permit certain recoveries.  
- **Preserving equitable remedies** (aligned with the external clauses on specific performance).  

If the parties have **asymmetrical liability caps or carveouts** elsewhere in the agreement, this clause ensures neither can claim certain damages unless explicitly permitted. Legal review should confirm whether exceptions (e.g., for fraud or indemnity) apply.

EXCEPT UNDER SECTIONS 13(a) AND 13(b), THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR DAMAGES OR ALLEGED DAMAGES HEREUNDER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO, AND WILL NOT EXCEED, THE AMOUNTS TO BE PAID BY CLIENT TO EXCITE HEREUNDER.","The **Limitation of Liability** clause is highly relevant to the query about **different liability caps and/or carveouts** between two parties. Here’s how:

### 1. **Differential Liability Caps**  
The clause imposes a **general cap on liability** for both parties, limiting damages to **""the amounts to be paid by Client to [Exciting] hereunder.""** However, it also includes **carveouts (exceptions)** under **Sections 13(a) and 13(b)**, where this cap does not apply.  
- This suggests that while both parties have a **shared liability cap** for most claims, certain breaches (those under Sections 13(a) and 13(b)) may **expose one or both parties to uncapped liability** (e.g., indemnification claims, fraud, or willful misconduct).  
- If **Sections 13(a) and 13(b)** apply asymmetrically (e.g., only one party is subject to uncapped liability for certain breaches), this creates a **difference in liability exposure** between the parties.

### 2. **Carveouts for Specific Remedies**  
The clause **excludes** certain damages (e.g., **consequential, incidental, or special damages**) from recovery **unless** they fall under **Sections 13(a) and 13(b)**.  
- This means that while **general liability is capped**, certain breaches (e.g., indemnified claims or intentional wrongdoing) may allow for **broader damages**, creating a **disparity in liability exposure** between the parties.  
- The external references (e.g., **specific performance and injunctive relief** in MAUD_102 and MAUD_417) suggest that **equitable remedies** may still apply even if monetary damages are capped, further complicating liability exposure.

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
- If one party has **additional carveouts** (e.g., indemnification obligations, fraud exceptions, or uncapped liability for certain breaches), their **liability exposure may be higher** than the other party’s.  
- The clause **does not explicitly state** whether the carveouts apply equally to both parties, leaving room for **negotiated asymmetry** in liability terms.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause demonstrates how a **standard liability cap** can be modified by **carveouts**, leading to **different liability exposures** for each party. If **Sections 13(a) and 13(b)** impose stricter obligations on one party (e.g., the Client or Exciting), their liability risk may be **uncapped or higher** in certain scenarios, while the other party remains protected by the general cap.

a) Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
b) Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party.","The **Limitation of Liability** clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **different liability caps and/or carveouts** between two parties. Here’s how:

### **1. Liability Caps**  
The clause imposes a **financial cap** on liability:  
- **Subsection (b)** limits each party’s liability to **""the amounts actually paid by the other party.""**  
- This means neither party can claim damages beyond what was paid under the contract, effectively capping exposure.  

However, if the parties have **different payment structures** (e.g., one pays more than the other), their liability caps could differ. For example:  
- If **Party A** paid **$100,000** and **Party B** paid **$50,000**, then:  
  - **Party A’s** max liability = **$50,000** (what Party B paid)  
  - **Party B’s** max liability = **$100,000** (what Party A paid)  

This creates an **asymmetrical liability cap**, which may be intentional or require negotiation.

### **2. Carveouts (Exceptions to Liability Limits)**  
The clause **excludes certain damages** but also **carves out exceptions** (referencing **Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2), (b)(iii)(3)**):  
- **Subsection (a)** excludes **indirect damages** (consequential, incidental, etc.) **unless** the exceptions in **Section 19** apply.  
- If **Section 19** includes carveouts for **fraud, willful misconduct, or indemnifiable claims**, those would **override the liability cap**.  

This means:  
- **Default Rule:** Liability is capped at amounts paid, and indirect damages are excluded.  
- **Carveouts:** If a claim falls under **Section 19’s exceptions**, the cap may **not apply**, exposing a party to **full liability**.  

### **3. Connection to External References (Specific Performance)**  
The external references discuss **specific performance** (equitable relief for breaches). While your clause focuses on **monetary liability**, the interplay matters because:  
- If a party seeks **specific performance** (e.g., forcing compliance with the contract), the **liability cap may not limit** that remedy.  
- However, **Section 8.3(d)** (referenced in **maud_446**) or **Section 7.4** (in **maud_102**) might further modify enforcement rights.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
1. **Asymmetrical Caps Possible:** If payments between parties differ, their liability caps may differ.  
2. **Carveouts Matter:** Exceptions in **Section 19** could **remove liability limits** for certain claims (e.g., fraud).  
3. **Non-Monetary Remedies:** Specific performance (from external references) may **bypass** these liability limits.

AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause **""11.4 Limitation of Liability""** is directly relevant to the query about a **""cap on liability without carveouts""** because it establishes a financial limit (AUD 50,000) on the liability of both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising from any cause related to the Agreement.  

### Key Observations:  
1. **General Cap on Liability**  
   - The clause imposes a strict monetary limit (AUD 50,000) on liability for both parties, regardless of the legal theory or form of action.  
   - This is a **hard cap** unless an exception applies.  

2. **Carveouts (Exceptions to the Cap)**  
   - The clause **does include carveouts**, meaning the Liability Cap **does not apply** in certain situations:  
     - **Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds** (after accounting for offsets).  
     - **The Merchant’s payment obligations** (e.g., fees, regulatory penalties due to non-performance).  
   - These carveouts ensure that core financial obligations remain enforceable beyond the Liability Cap.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The query asks about a **""cap on liability without carveouts,""** but this clause **does include carveouts**.  
- If the intent was to draft a **strict cap with no exceptions**, this clause would need to **remove the listed carveouts** (i.e., delete subsections (1) and (2)).  
- The carveouts ensure that critical financial obligations (like payment processing and regulatory compliance) are not limited, which is common in commercial agreements to mitigate risk.  

### Comparison with External References:  
- The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** on equitable relief) reinforce that certain breaches (like failure to perform) may justify remedies beyond monetary damages.  
- Similarly, the **Termination Fee** clause shows that some liabilities (like breakup fees) are treated separately from general liability caps.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is **not a pure ""cap without carveouts""** but rather a **capped liability structure with specific exceptions**. If the goal is a strict, no-exceptions cap, the carveouts would need to be removed.",5
Cap on liability without carveouts,4e4ca46b2e,"CarMax's liability, if any, for any loss or damage in any way connected with, arising out of or resulting from this Agreement shall not exceed the price allocable to the particular Products or Services upon which such liability is based, regardless of whether such liability arises in contract, tort (including, without limitation, negligence or strict liability) or otherwise. In no event shall CarMax be liable for loss of profits or revenue or for any incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages.","The clause you provided is a **cap on liability without carveouts**, which directly addresses your query. Here's how it aligns with the request:

### Key Features of the Clause:
1. **Liability Cap**:  
   - CarMax's liability is explicitly limited to **the price allocable to the specific Products or Services** giving rise to the claim. This creates a clear financial ceiling on liability, regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, etc.).

2. **No Carveouts**:  
   - The clause does **not** exempt certain types of claims or breaches (e.g., willful misconduct, gross negligence, IP infringement, or indemnity obligations) from the cap. This is a ""pure"" cap on liability without exceptions.  
   - Contrast this with clauses that might exclude, for example, ""breaches of confidentiality"" or ""third-party claims"" from the cap.

3. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly bars recovery for **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, or punitive damages), reinforcing the limitation of liability.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The query asks for a **cap on liability without carveouts**, and this clause fits that description because:  
  - It imposes a strict monetary limit tied to the value of the Products/Services.  
  - It applies broadly to **all** claims (contract, tort, etc.) without exceptions.  
  - The external information (e.g., Sections 9.10 and 8.5) discusses equitable remedies like specific performance but does not override the liability cap here. The clause’s language (""**regardless of whether such liability arises in contract, tort... or otherwise**"") ensures no implied carveouts exist.

### Practical Implications:
- **Favoring CarMax**: This clause heavily protects CarMax by minimizing exposure to large or unpredictable damages.  
- **Risk Allocation**: The other party assumes risks beyond the capped amount, including indirect losses.  
- **Enforceability**: Such clauses are generally enforceable unless unconscionable or against public policy (e.g., in cases of fraud or intentional harm, though the clause does not carve those out).

If the query sought a cap *with* carveouts (e.g., for indemnity or IP claims), this clause would not suffice. But as written, it is a straightforward example of a **no-carveout liability cap**.",5
Cap on liability without carveouts,e156a5b7c4,"28.2. Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The clause you provided (Section 28.2 - Limitations of Liability) is directly relevant to the query about a **""cap on liability without carveouts""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Cap on Liability**  
The clause imposes a strict **monetary cap** on liability for breaches of the agreement, limiting recoverable damages to **""an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement""**. This is a clear example of a liability cap, which is the core focus of the query.

### 2. **No Carveouts for Contractual Breaches**  
The clause **does not carve out** typical exceptions like:  
   - **Willful misconduct** (explicitly included under the cap).  
   - **Negligence** (covered unless it involves personal injury/death).  
   - **Equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions or specific performance, which are addressed separately in the external references but not excluded here).  

   The **only carveout** is for **personal injury/death caused by negligence**, which is legally required in many jurisdictions (and thus not a negotiated exception). This aligns with the query’s focus on a cap **without additional carveouts**.

### 3. **Contrast with External References**  
The external clauses (Sections 9.10 and 8.5) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief**, emphasizing that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches. However, **Section 28.2 does not conflict with these** because:  
   - It caps **monetary liability** but does not restrict non-monetary remedies (e.g., injunctions).  
   - The phrase **""amount recoverable""** implies the cap applies only to financial damages, preserving equitable remedies.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause is a **strong example of a liability cap with minimal carveouts**, addressing only what is legally necessary (personal injury/death). It does not undermine other remedies (like specific performance) but ensures that **monetary recovery is strictly limited**.

9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.

Here’s the breakdown:

### 1. **Liability Cap Structure**  
   - **Section 9.1** imposes a maximum liability limit (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the Agreement.  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on capping liability but goes further by explicitly **excluding certain scenarios** (carveouts).

### 2. **Key Carveouts (Exceptions to the Cap)**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Material breaches of confidentiality** (Section 5)  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1)  
   - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2)  

   These carveouts ensure that the cap does not shield a party from liability for egregious acts, breaches of core obligations (e.g., confidentiality), or indemnity claims.  

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - The query asks about a cap **without carveouts**, but this clause **explicitly includes carveouts**.  
   - If the intent is to draft a **true ""no carveouts"" cap**, this clause would need to:  
     - Remove Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 entirely.  
     - State that the cap applies **universally** (e.g., ""under no circumstances shall liability exceed [***]"").  
   - The clause also defines ""liability"" broadly (Section 9.2), which could be retained in a no-carveout version.  

### 4. **Contrast with External Information**  
   The external excerpts (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, which are typically **unaffected by liability caps**. This clause does not conflict with those concepts but focuses on **monetary liability limits**.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is a **cap with carveouts**, not a pure ""no carveouts"" cap. To align with the query:  
- Remove exceptions (9.1.1, 9.1.2) for a strict cap.  
- Ensure the broad definition of liability (9.2) remains if intended to cover all damage types.

### **Relevance of the Provided Clause to the Query:**  
The clause in question (Section 9) **does not** represent a pure ""cap on liability without carveouts"" because it includes **multiple carveouts** (exceptions) where the liability cap does not apply. Specifically:  

1. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap (§9.1.1 & §9.1.2):**  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).  
     - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).  
     - Intentional misconduct or gross negligence.  

2. **Broad Definition of ""Liability"" (§9.2):**  
   - While the clause defines liability broadly (covering contract, tort, statutory claims, etc.), the carveouts significantly limit the scope of the cap.  

### **Comparison to a True ""Cap Without Carveouts"":**  
A true **""cap without carveouts""** would mean:  
- No exceptions—liability is capped for **all** claims (including breaches of confidentiality, indemnification, fraud, gross negligence, etc.).  
- Such a clause would be rare and highly favorable to the party benefiting from the cap (often seen in heavily negotiated deals where one party has significant leverage).  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause provided **does not match** the query because it includes **carveouts** for material confidentiality breaches, indemnification, intentional misconduct, and gross negligence. A true ""cap without carveouts"" would lack these exceptions.

Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause **""11.4 Limitation of Liability""** is directly relevant to the query on **""liability cap carveouts""** because it:  

1. **Establishes a Liability Cap** – The clause sets a general limit (AUD 50,000) on the liability of both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising from any cause related to the agreement.  

2. **Specifies Carveouts (Exceptions to the Liability Cap)** – The clause explicitly excludes certain obligations from the liability cap, meaning these obligations are **uncapped** and can result in full liability. The carveouts include:  
   - **Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds** (after accounting for offsets).  
   - **The Merchant’s payment obligations** (e.g., fees, regulatory penalties due to non-performance).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The query seeks examples of **liability cap carveouts**—provisions that exclude certain liabilities from a general cap. This clause provides a clear example of such carveouts.  
- The carveouts ensure that **critical financial obligations** (like payment remittance and regulatory compliance) remain fully enforceable, even if other liabilities are capped.  
- The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* on equitable relief and *Section 8.02* on termination fees) highlight that contracts often **exclude certain remedies or obligations** from general limitations, reinforcing the concept seen in this clause.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause demonstrates how liability caps are **not absolute**—parties often exclude high-stakes obligations (e.g., payments, regulatory fines) to ensure enforceability and mitigate key risks. This aligns with broader contractual practices where carveouts protect fundamental rights or financial interests.",5
liability cap carveouts,4e4ca46b2e,"CarMax's liability, if any, for any loss or damage in any way connected with, arising out of or resulting from this Agreement shall not exceed the price allocable to the particular Products or Services upon which such liability is based, regardless of whether such liability arises in contract, tort (including, without limitation, negligence or strict liability) or otherwise. In no event shall CarMax be liable for loss of profits or revenue or for any incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages.","The clause you provided is a **limitation of liability** provision, which is directly relevant to the query about **""liability cap carveouts.""** Here's how:

### **1. Liability Cap**  
The clause imposes a **monetary cap** on CarMax's liability, limiting it to **the price allocable to the particular Products or Services** involved. This means that CarMax's maximum financial exposure for any claim related to the agreement is strictly tied to the value of the specific transaction, not the broader potential losses a counterparty might suffer.

### **2. Carveouts (or Lack Thereof)**  
The clause does **not** explicitly carve out (exclude) certain types of claims from the liability cap. Typically, carveouts in liability caps might include:  
- **Intentional misconduct or fraud**  
- **Gross negligence**  
- **Willful breach**  
- **Indemnification obligations**  
- **IP infringement claims**  
- **Breach of confidentiality**  

Since the clause does **not** mention any exceptions, it suggests that the cap applies **universally**—even to claims like negligence or strict liability. However, this could be problematic if the agreement elsewhere (or under applicable law) allows for uncapped liability in certain scenarios (e.g., fraud or willful breaches).

### **3. Exclusion of Consequential Damages**  
The clause explicitly **excludes** liability for:  
- **Loss of profits or revenue**  
- **Incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages**  

This reinforces the liability cap by ensuring that certain high-risk damages (often the most significant in disputes) are **not recoverable at all**, further limiting CarMax's exposure.

### **4. Relevance to External Information**  
The external references discuss **specific performance** and **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) as carveouts to monetary liability limits. If the agreement has provisions like those in the external examples, they could override the liability cap for certain breaches (e.g., where monetary damages are inadequate). However, your clause does **not** address equitable remedies, so it remains silent on whether injunctive relief or specific performance would be exempt from the cap.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is a **broad limitation of liability** with:  
- A **monetary cap** (tied to product/service value)  
- **No explicit carveouts** for intentional misconduct or other high-risk claims  
- A **blanket exclusion** of consequential damages  

If the parties intend to **carve out** certain liabilities (e.g., fraud, indemnities, or equitable relief), those exceptions should be expressly stated—otherwise, courts may enforce the cap as written.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### 1. **Liability Cap**  
   - Section 9.1 sets a monetary limit (""[***]"") on one party’s liability to the other party and its affiliates for claims related to the agreement.  
   - This cap is a standard risk-allocation tool to protect parties from excessive exposure, particularly in commercial contracts.

### 2. **Carveouts to the Liability Cap**  
The clause explicitly carves out (excludes) certain types of liability from the cap:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches** (Section 9.1.1(1)): Material breaches of confidentiality obligations (Section 5) are excluded, meaning liability for such breaches could be uncapped.  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 9.1.1(2)): Claims under Section 7.1 (indemnification) are not subject to the cap, preserving full liability for indemnified matters (e.g., third-party claims, IP infringement, etc.).  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2): Acts involving deliberate wrongdoing or severe negligence are excluded, aligning with legal principles that discourage limiting liability for egregious conduct.  

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause demonstrates how carveouts function to:  
   - **Balance risk**: While capping ordinary contractual liabilities, it ensures accountability for high-stakes scenarios (e.g., breaches of core obligations like confidentiality or indemnity).  
   - **Reflect legal norms**: Carveouts for gross negligence/intentional misconduct are common to avoid unenforceability (many jurisdictions prohibit limiting liability for such conduct).  
   - **Link to external context**: The external information (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) highlights equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches. Though not directly about liability caps, it underscores that certain breaches (like confidentiality) may warrant uncapped remedies (e.g., specific performance).  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause is a clear example of **drafting liability caps with strategic carveouts** to address high-priority risks while maintaining enforceability. The carveouts ensure that parties remain fully liable for critical obligations (confidentiality, indemnity) and wrongful conduct, even if general liabilities are capped.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Liability Cap and Carveouts**  
- The clause establishes a **maximum liability cap** (""[***]"") for claims arising under the agreement (Section 9.1).  
- However, it **carves out exceptions** where the cap does not apply (Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2), including:  
  - **Material breaches of confidentiality** (Section 5).  
  - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1).  
  - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**.  

These carveouts ensure that the liability cap does not shield a party from accountability for egregious or high-risk conduct (e.g., willful wrongdoing) or specific contractual obligations (e.g., indemnification).

### 2. **Connection to External Information**  
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) emphasize remedies like **injunctive relief** and **specific performance** for breaches, noting that monetary damages may be inadequate. While those sections focus on equitable remedies, the provided clause complements them by:  
- Clarifying that **certain breaches (e.g., confidentiality, indemnity) are excluded from liability limits**, aligning with the broader theme that some obligations are too critical to be capped.  
- Reinforcing that **intentional/grossly negligent acts** are treated more severely, which may intersect with claims for equitable relief (e.g., injunctions to stop ongoing harm).  

### 3. **Practical Implications**  
- **Risk Allocation**: The carveouts ensure that parties remain fully liable for high-stakes obligations (e.g., confidentiality, indemnity) or bad-faith actions.  
- **Enforcement**: If a carveout applies (e.g., a material confidentiality breach), the injured party can seek **uncapped damages** or potentially **equitable remedies** (per the external clauses) without being constrained by the liability cap.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause is a classic example of **""liability cap carveouts""**—it limits general liability but preserves exposure for specific, high-priority risks. This balances risk management with accountability, ensuring critical protections (e.g., confidentiality, indemnity) and deterring misconduct. The external context underscores that such carveouts may coexist with other remedies (e.g., injunctions) where monetary caps would be insufficient.

liability cap carveouts,e156a5b7c4,"28.2. Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The clause you provided (Section 28.2 - Limitations of Liability) is directly relevant to the query about **""liability cap carveouts""** because it establishes a general cap on liability while explicitly carving out exceptions where the cap does not apply. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of carveouts:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause limits the recoverable amount for breaches of the Agreement (whether due to negligence, wilful misconduct, or otherwise) to **the total payments made under the Agreement**.  
   - This is a typical liability cap, protecting parties from unlimited exposure for contractual breaches.

2. **Carveout for Personal Injury/Death**:  
   - The clause explicitly **excludes** liability for ""personal injury or death caused by negligence"" from the cap.  
   - This is a carveout because it removes certain categories of liability (those involving personal harm) from the capped amount, recognizing that such claims may require full legal remedies under applicable law.

3. **Implied Carveout for Equitable Relief**:  
   - While not explicitly stated here, the external information (Sections 9.10 and 8.5) highlights that **specific performance/injunctive relief** is another common carveout to liability caps.  
   - These sections clarify that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches (e.g., failure to perform obligations), so equitable remedies (like injunctions) are preserved despite any liability cap.  
   - Your clause’s phrase ""amount recoverable"" suggests it applies only to monetary damages, leaving room for non-monetary remedies (like specific performance) to operate as an implied carveout.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause demonstrates a **standard liability cap structure with explicit carveouts** (e.g., personal injury/death) and potential implicit ones (equitable relief, as inferred from the external context).  
- Carveouts ensure that certain high-risk or non-monetary claims (e.g., harm to life, breaches requiring injunctions) are not constrained by the cap, balancing risk allocation between parties.  

### Drafting Note:  
To align with the external information, you might explicitly reference carveouts for **specific performance** (as in Sections 9.10/8.5) to avoid ambiguity about whether equitable claims are capped. Example addition:  
> *""This limitation shall not apply to (i) claims for personal injury or death, or (ii) remedies expressly granted under Section [X] (Specific Performance).""*

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 9)** is directly relevant to the query about a **""cap on liability subject to law""** because it establishes a contractual limit (the **""Liability Cap""**) on the maximum liability one party can incur to the other under the agreement, while also outlining exceptions where this cap does not apply. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### 1. **Explicit Cap on Liability**  
   - Section 9.1 sets a monetary cap (**[***]**) on liability between the parties, which aligns with the concept of a ""cap on liability.""  
   - This cap is a contractual safeguard to limit exposure to damages, ensuring predictability in risk allocation.

### 2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Subject to Law)**  
   The clause carves out scenarios where the cap **does not apply**, reflecting legal principles that may override contractual limitations:  
   - **Material confidentiality breaches (Section 5)**: Protects against unlimited liability for breaches of sensitive obligations.  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**: Ensures indemnity claims (e.g., third-party claims) remain uncapped, as indemnities often address broader risks.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence**: Aligns with legal norms that prohibit parties from shielding themselves from liability for egregious conduct.  
     - Many jurisdictions (e.g., Delaware, under common law) invalidate caps for fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence, as implied by the external references (e.g., equitable remedies in *Section 8.5(c)* and *Section 10.12(a)*).  

### 3. **Legal Context from External References**  
   - The external clauses emphasize that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) are available for breaches, even if monetary damages are capped. This suggests that:  
     - A liability cap may not restrict non-monetary relief (e.g., enforcing confidentiality under Section 5).  
     - Courts may disregard the cap if enforcing it would contravene public policy (e.g., for gross negligence).  

### 4. **Broad Definition of ""Liability""**  
   - Section 9.2 defines liability expansively (covering contract, tort, statutory claims, etc.), ensuring the cap applies across all legal theories unless an exception is triggered.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause implements a **""cap on liability""** but subordinates it to legal boundaries (e.g., misconduct exceptions, indemnities, and equitable remedies). It mirrors the external information’s theme that contractual limitations are enforceable only to the extent permitted by law, particularly where equity or public policy intervenes.  

**Practical Relevance**:  
- Drafters must ensure the cap’s exceptions align with governing law (e.g., Delaware’s rejection of caps for bad faith).  
- Parties cannot rely on the cap to avoid liability for acts courts deem unwaivable (e.g., fraud).",5

1. **Establishing a Liability Cap**:  
   - Section 9.1 sets a maximum liability limit (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the Agreement, capping one party's exposure to the other party and its affiliates at a specified amount ([***]).  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Subject to Law)**:  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5) or indemnification obligations (Section 7.1) (Section 9.1.1).  
     - Intentional misconduct or gross negligence (Section 9.1.2).  
   - These exceptions align with general legal principles where caps on liability are often unenforceable for egregious conduct (e.g., gross negligence) or specific statutory/equitable remedies.  

3. **Legal Context from External Information**:  
   - The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102 and MAUD_417) emphasize that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) are available for breaches, even if monetary damages are capped. This suggests that:  
     - The Liability Cap in Section 9 would **not override** a court’s ability to grant non-monetary relief (e.g., enforcing confidentiality or indemnification).  
     - The cap is subject to broader legal limitations (e.g., courts may disregard caps for statutory violations or public policy reasons).  

4. **Definition of Liability**:  
   - Section 9.2 broadly defines ""liability"" to include all claims (contract, tort, statutory, etc.), but the exceptions ensure the cap complies with legal standards (e.g., you cannot contractually limit liability for fraud or willful misconduct).  

### Relevance to Query:  
The clause directly addresses a **""cap on liability""** while qualifying it as **""subject to law""** through:  
- Explicit carve-outs for scenarios where courts or statutes might invalidate caps (e.g., gross negligence).  
- Alignment with external provisions confirming that equitable remedies (not subject to caps) remain available.

Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The **""Liability Cap"" clause (Section 11.3)** is directly relevant to the query about a **""cap on liability subject to law""** because it establishes a financial limit on liability for breaches of the agreement, while explicitly carving out exceptions where such a cap would not apply due to legal or regulatory requirements. Here’s the breakdown:

### 1. **Cap on Liability**  
The clause limits the total liability of one party to the other for claims (e.g., breaches of the agreement) to:  
   - The aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products in the **12 months preceding the claim notification**,  
   - Minus any amounts already paid/payable for other claims in that period.  

   This creates a clear **monetary ceiling** on liability, protecting parties from excessive exposure.

### 2. **Exceptions (""Subject to Law"")**  
The cap **does not apply** in three scenarios, which align with legal or regulatory constraints:  
   - **Breaches involving unauthorized use of Intellectual Property** (IP rights are often protected by strict statutory remedies).  
   - **Intentional breach or willful misconduct** (many jurisdictions prohibit limiting liability for intentional wrongdoing).  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations** (parties cannot contractually override statutory obligations).  

   These exceptions ensure the cap complies with **mandatory legal standards**, addressing the ""subject to law"" aspect of the query.

### 3. **Relevance to External Information**  
While the provided external excerpts (from Section 10.3) discuss termination fees tied to acquisition proposals, they do not directly address liability caps. However, they highlight how the agreement structures financial consequences in specific scenarios, reinforcing the broader context where **Section 11.3’s liability cap** operates alongside other remedies (e.g., termination fees).

### Key Takeaway  
The clause balances contractual risk allocation with legal compliance:  
- It enforces a **predictable liability limit** for ordinary breaches.  
- It **preserves accountability** where law or public policy demands it (e.g., for intentional misconduct or IP violations).  

This aligns with the query by demonstrating how a cap on liability is **qualified by legal exceptions** to remain enforceable.",5
cap on liability subject to law,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The **""cap on liability subject to law""** query relates to contractual provisions that limit a party's liability, but such limitations must comply with applicable legal standards. The provided **Clause 11.4 (Limitation of Liability)** is directly relevant to this query because it:  

1. **Imposes a Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause limits Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to **AUD 50,000** for losses arising from any cause connected to the Agreement, regardless of the legal theory (e.g., breach of contract, negligence).  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds (core contractual duty).  
     - The Merchant’s payment obligations (e.g., fees, regulatory penalties due to non-performance).  
   - These exceptions ensure that fundamental obligations remain enforceable despite the liability cap.  

3. **Subject to Law**:  
   - While the clause sets a contractual limit, its enforceability depends on whether it complies with **mandatory legal principles** (e.g., consumer protection laws, unconscionability doctrines, or statutory prohibitions on limiting liability for gross negligence/willful misconduct).  
   - The **external information** (e.g., Section 8.5) highlights that equitable remedies (like injunctions) may override limitations if monetary damages are inadequate, suggesting courts could disregard the cap if it conflicts with legal rights to relief.  

### Key Relevance:  
The clause exemplifies a **contractual liability cap**, but its validity is inherently ""subject to law."" If a court finds the cap unreasonable or contrary to public policy (e.g., for essential obligations or egregious misconduct), it may be unenforceable. The exceptions align with common legal carveouts (e.g., fiduciary duties, fraud), reinforcing that the cap is not absolute.

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR SUCH OTHER PARTY, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause** (Clause 11) is directly relevant to the query about a **""cap on liability subject to law""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Explicit Cap on Liability**  
The clause imposes a **monetary cap** on liability by stating that D2's liability cannot exceed the **total amount paid or owed by Licensee to D2 under the agreement**. This ensures that liability is contractually limited to a defined financial threshold.

### 2. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**  
The clause explicitly **excludes** liability for:  
- **Lost profits**  
- **Consequential, special, incidental, or indirect damages**  
This aligns with the concept of a **liability cap** by narrowing the scope of recoverable damages.  

### 3. **Subject to Law (Implied Limitation)**  
While the clause does not explicitly state ""subject to applicable law,"" such limitations are generally interpreted **within the bounds of enforceability under governing law**. For example:  
- If **Delaware law** governs (as referenced in the external information), courts may uphold such limitations unless they violate public policy or statutory rights.  
- The external clauses (e.g., **Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction**) reinforce that remedies (including liability limitations) are subject to **jurisdictional legal standards**.  

### 4. **Interaction with Equitable Remedies**  
The external information highlights that parties retain rights to **specific performance and injunctive relief** (e.g., enforcing merger obligations). This suggests that while **monetary liability is capped**, non-monetary remedies (like injunctions) may still apply, ensuring the clause does not undermine fundamental contractual rights.  

### **Conclusion**  
The **Limitation of Liability clause** effectively **caps liability** by:  
- Setting a **maximum financial exposure** (amount paid/owed).  
- **Excluding certain damages** (e.g., consequential losses).  
- Operating within the **legal framework** (implied by governing law and equitable remedies).  

However, its enforceability may depend on **jurisdictional laws** (e.g., Delaware courts' interpretation of contractual limitations). The external clauses confirm that while liability is contractually limited, parties retain **non-monetary enforcement rights** where damages would be inadequate.

Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause

AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The query concerns a **""compliance with law carveout to cap on liability""**—i.e., whether the liability cap in the clause excludes liability arising from violations of law or regulatory requirements. Here’s how **Clause 11.4** is relevant to this query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause imposes a cap (AUD 50,000) on liability for both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising from any cause, regardless of legal theory.  
   - This is a broad limitation covering most contractual, tort, or statutory claims.

2. **Carveouts to the Cap**:  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds** (after offsets).  
   - **The Merchant’s payment obligations** (e.g., Services, Network Security Fees, or regulatory-imposed amounts due to a party’s failure to perform).  

### Relevance to the Query:
- **Regulatory Compliance Carveout**:  
   The second carveout explicitly includes **""amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement.""**  
   - This means liability arising from **non-compliance with laws/regulations** (e.g., fines, penalties, or restitution ordered by a regulator) is **not subject to the AUD 50,000 cap**.  
   - The carveout ensures that statutory or regulatory liabilities (e.g., data privacy breaches, anti-money laundering violations) remain fully enforceable.  

- **Link to External Information**:  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)**) emphasize equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, suggesting that certain obligations (like regulatory compliance) are treated as critical and non-capable of being limited.  
   - The **Termination Fee** clause (**8.02(b)**) similarly shows that specific breaches (e.g., accepting an Acquisition Proposal) trigger uncapped liability, aligning with the idea that some obligations are too material to cap.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **does include a carveout for compliance with law**, as it explicitly excludes regulatory-imposed amounts from the liability cap. This ensures that statutory/regulatory penalties or obligations are not limited by the general cap, addressing the query directly.  

**Drafting Note**: If further clarity is needed, consider explicitly listing ""violations of law"" as a separate carveout (e.g., ""or (3) liability arising from a party’s breach of applicable law""). This would eliminate ambiguity about whether non-monetary regulatory actions (e.g., injunctions) are also excluded.",5

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The query concerns a **""compliance with law carveout to cap on liability""**—i.e., whether the limitation of liability clause (Section 9) includes an exception for breaches of legal or regulatory compliance obligations.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query**  
1. **General Cap on Liability (Section 9.1)**  
   - The clause imposes a **monetary cap (""Liability Cap"")** on a party's liability to the other party, except in specific carveout scenarios.  

2. **Carveouts to the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1 & 9.1.2)**  
   - The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
     - **Material confidentiality breaches (Section 5)**  
     - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**  
     - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**  
   - However, **there is no explicit carveout for breaches of law or regulatory compliance obligations** (e.g., violations of antitrust, data protection, or securities laws).  

3. **Implications for Compliance with Law**  
   - If a party's breach of law (e.g., fraud, regulatory non-compliance) does not fall under **intentional misconduct/gross negligence** or another listed exception, the **Liability Cap may still apply**.  
   - This could be problematic if the agreement does not explicitly exclude statutory/regulatory liabilities from the cap.  

### **Comparison with External References**  
The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) emphasize **equitable remedies (injunctions, specific performance)** for breaches, but they do not directly address **liability caps for legal violations**.  

### **Recommendation**  
If the parties intend to exclude **liability arising from legal/regulatory non-compliance** from the cap, they should:  
   - **Add an explicit carveout** (e.g., *""The Liability Cap shall not apply to any liability arising from a breach of applicable law or regulatory requirements.""*)  
   - **Clarify whether statutory penalties or government-imposed fines are subject to the cap.**  

Without such language, courts may interpret the clause narrowly, potentially exposing parties to capped liability even for serious legal violations.

### Relevance of the Provided Clause:  
The **Limitation of Liability** clause (Section 9) imposes a cap (""Liability Cap"") on a party's liability under the agreement but includes **two key carveouts**:  
1. **Exclusions from the Cap**:  
   - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).  
   - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).  
   - Intentional misconduct or gross negligence.  

2. **No Explicit ""Compliance with Law"" Carveout**:  
   - The clause does **not** explicitly mention breaches of law, statutory violations, or regulatory non-compliance as exceptions to the Liability Cap.  
   - If a party violates a law (e.g., data protection, antitrust, or securities regulations), the default position is that the Liability Cap **would apply**, unless:  
     - The violation also constitutes **intentional misconduct/gross negligence** (which is carved out under Section 9.1.2), or  
     - The breach triggers **indemnification** (e.g., under Section 7.1, if the indemnity covers regulatory fines).  

### Comparison with External References:  
The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) discuss **equitable remedies** (injunctions, specific performance) for breaches but do not address liability caps. They emphasize that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches, which could indirectly support arguments for overriding liability limits in cases of legal non-compliance.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **does not expressly carve out liability for breaches of law** unless they fall under:  
- Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1),  
- Intentional/gross misconduct (Section 9.1.2), or  
- Confidentiality breaches (Section 5).  

If the parties intend to exclude statutory/regulatory violations from the Liability Cap, an explicit **""compliance with law"" exception** should be added to Section 9.1.1 or 9.1.2.

compliance with law carveout to cap on liability,c677011b32,"16.15 Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO OBLIGATIONS TO INDEMNIFY A PARTY FOR CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (OR ITS AFFILIATES) PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, TREBLE, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE OF, OR FAILURE TO PERFORM, ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARE CAUSED BY THE SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS BEING WAIVED HEREBY.","The query concerns a **""compliance with law carveout to cap on liability""**—essentially asking whether there is an exception to the limitation of liability clause where a party's liability arises from a breach of legal or regulatory requirements.  

### Relevance of the Clause to the Query:  
The **""Limitation of Liability""** clause (Section 16.15) broadly restricts liability for certain types of damages (consequential, incidental, indirect, special, punitive, etc.), even if caused by negligence or fault. However, it **explicitly carves out indemnification obligations for third-party claims**, meaning liability for such claims is not capped.  

### Connection to Compliance with Law:  
1. **No Express Compliance Carveout** – The clause does **not** explicitly mention an exception for liability arising from violations of law (e.g., statutory breaches, regulatory non-compliance). This suggests that, unless another provision in the agreement addresses this (e.g., indemnification or a separate compliance clause), liability for such breaches may still be limited.  
2. **Potential Overlap with Indemnification** – If a third party (e.g., a regulator or claimant) brings a claim due to a party’s non-compliance with law, the indemnification carveout may apply, preserving liability exposure. However, direct claims between the parties for breaches of law might still fall under the liability cap.  
3. **External Context (Specific Performance)** – The external references (Sections 8.5 and 9.10) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, but they do not override the liability cap for monetary damages. If a party violates a law, the non-breaching party might seek specific performance rather than damages, but the limitation clause would still restrict monetary recovery.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **limits liability for most damages** but does not explicitly carve out liability for breaches of law unless they involve third-party claims (indemnification exception). If compliance-related liability is a concern, the agreement may need:  
- A separate carveout for statutory/regulatory breaches, or  
- Clarification in the indemnification section to cover compliance-related claims.

### Relevance of Clause 28.2 to the Query:  
1. **General Cap on Liability**:  
   - The clause imposes a **monetary cap** on liability (""amount recoverable... shall not exceed... payments made under this Agreement"") for breaches arising from negligence, wilful misconduct, or other defaults.  

2. **Carveout for Legal Compliance**:  
   - The clause explicitly **exempts liability for personal injury or death caused by negligence** (""for which by law no limit applies""). This reflects a carveout where **mandatory law (e.g., tort law)** prohibits limiting liability for certain harms, even if the contract attempts to do so.  

3. **Implications for Compliance with Law**:  
   - The clause acknowledges that **statutory or common law principles (e.g., negligence claims)** may override contractual liability limits. This aligns with the query’s focus on legal carveouts.  
   - However, it does not address other potential legal overrides (e.g., fraud, statutory penalties, or equitable remedies like specific performance, which are covered in the external information).  

### Connection to External Information:  
The external clauses (e.g., Sections 9.10 and 8.5(c)) emphasize that **equitable remedies (e.g., specific performance)** are preserved despite other contractual limitations. While Clause 28.2 caps monetary liability, it does not restrict non-monetary remedies (e.g., injunctions) that might be required to comply with law or enforce the agreement.  

### Key Takeaway:  
Clause 28.2 demonstrates a **partial carveout for legal compliance** (e.g., negligence claims for personal injury), but it does not comprehensively address all scenarios where law might override liability caps (e.g., statutory breaches, equitable relief). The query would require further analysis of other clauses (like those in the external information) to assess the full scope of legal carveouts.

Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   - Section 9.1 sets a maximum liability limit (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the agreement.  
   - This cap is a standard risk-allocation tool to limit exposure to unforeseen or excessive damages.

2. **Carveouts to the Liability Cap**:  
   - **Indemnification Obligations (Section 9.1.1)**:  
     The Liability Cap **does not apply** to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1. This means claims covered by indemnification (e.g., third-party claims, breaches of specific warranties, or other agreed-upon scenarios) are **uncapped** and can exceed the general liability limit.  
     - *Relevance to Query*: This is a clear ""indemnification carveout"" to the cap, ensuring indemnified parties retain full recourse for covered losses.  

   - **Confidentiality Breaches (Section 9.1.1)**:  
     Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5) are also excluded from the cap, aligning with the heightened sensitivity of confidential information.  

   - **Intentional Misconduct/Gross Negligence (Section 9.1.2)**:  
     The cap does not apply to bad-faith actions or severe negligence, which are typically excluded from liability limits as a matter of public policy.  

3. **Scope of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**:  
   - The broad definition of ""liability"" (covering damages, attorney fees, statutory claims, etc.) ensures the cap and its carveouts apply comprehensively across all claim types.  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external clauses focus on **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions for breaches), your clause deals with **monetary liability limits**. However, both reflect a similar intent:  
- The external clauses preserve non-monetary remedies (e.g., specific performance) outside typical damages.  
- Your clause preserves uncapped monetary remedies for indemnification and other high-risk scenarios, ensuring critical obligations are fully enforceable.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause explicitly answers the question by:  
1. **Carving out indemnification** from the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1).  
2. Clarifying that indemnified claims are treated as **separate and uncapped** liabilities, overriding the general limit.  

This ensures parties cannot shield themselves from indemnification obligations via the Liability Cap, balancing risk allocation while protecting core interests.  

**Drafting Note**: If further specificity is needed, consider referencing the types of indemnified claims (e.g., third-party claims, IP infringement) in Section 7.1 to avoid ambiguity.",5

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel.

### **Relevance of Clause 14.4 to the Query:**  
1. **Indemnification Scope & Carveouts:**  
   - The clause broadly requires the indemnifying party (""You"") to indemnify the Indemnitees for **all losses and expenses** arising from the Franchised Business, including strict or vicarious liability.  
   - However, there is a **carveout**: The indemnity **does not apply** to liability arising from the **gross negligence of the Indemnitees** (unless joint liability is involved, in which case comparative/contributory negligence by ""You"" is still covered).  
   - This means the indemnitor is **not liable** for losses caused **solely** by the Indemnitees' gross negligence, effectively **capping** their liability in such cases.  

2. **No Explicit Monetary Cap on Liability:**  
   - While the clause **limits liability for gross negligence**, it does **not** impose a **monetary cap** (e.g., a dollar limit) on indemnifiable losses.  
   - The carveout is **qualitative** (based on fault) rather than **quantitative** (based on a financial limit).  

3. **External Context (Optional Consideration):**  
   - The provided external clauses (e.g., termination fees, equitable relief) do not directly impact this indemnification clause, as they deal with different contractual mechanisms.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause **contains a carveout for gross negligence** (a liability cap based on fault) but **does not include a monetary cap** on indemnification obligations. If the query seeks a **financial limitation**, this clause does not provide one—only a **fault-based exception**.

9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause is directly relevant to the query about an **""indemnification carveout to cap on liability""** because it explicitly addresses the relationship between indemnification obligations and a general limitation of liability (Liability Cap). Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **General Liability Cap (Section 9.1)**  
   - The clause imposes a maximum liability limit (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the Agreement.  
   - This cap applies broadly to liabilities in contract, tort, statute, etc.  

2. **Carveouts to the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1 and 9.1.2)**  
   - **Indemnification Obligations (Section 7.1):**  
     The Liability Cap **does not apply** to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1. This means claims covered by indemnification (e.g., third-party claims, breaches of specific warranties) are **excluded from the cap**, allowing for full recovery as agreed in the indemnity section.  
   - **Confidentiality Breaches (Section 5):**  
     Material breaches of confidentiality are also carved out from the cap, ensuring uncapped liability for such violations.  
   - **Intentional Misconduct/Gross Negligence:**  
     The cap does not limit liability for acts involving bad faith or severe negligence.  

3. **Alignment with Query**  
   - The clause explicitly answers the query by demonstrating how indemnification obligations are **carved out** from a general liability cap. This ensures that indemnified parties retain full recourse for covered claims, even if other liabilities are capped.  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts focus on equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, they reinforce the broader theme that certain obligations (like indemnification or confidentiality) are treated as **critical exceptions** to general limitations (e.g., caps or monetary remedies). The clause in question operationalizes this principle by excluding indemnification from the Liability Cap, similar to how equitable relief is preserved despite other limitations.  

### Practical Implication:  
The carveout ensures that:  
- Indemnification remains a **potent remedy** (uncapped) for specific risks (e.g., third-party claims).  
- The Liability Cap still governs ordinary breaches or negligence, providing predictability for routine disputes.  

In summary, the clause is a clear example of an **indemnification carveout to a liability cap**, addressing the query directly.",5
indemnification carveout to cap on liability,eb935e4d2e,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits. This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The query concerns an **""indemnification carveout to cap on liability,""** which refers to whether indemnification obligations are exempt from (or ""carved out"" of) a general limitation on liability in the contract. Here's how the provided clause (**Sections 12.3 and 12.4**) addresses this:

### Key Points:
1. **General Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - The clause imposes a **monetary cap** (""$[* * *]"") on each party's aggregate liability for **all causes of action** (contract, tort, negligence, etc.).  
   - This cap applies broadly (""any and all causes whatsoever"") and includes claims arising under the **indemnification provisions** (Section 12).  

2. **Indemnification Carveout (Section 12.3)**  
   - While the clause excludes liability for **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits), it explicitly **carves out indemnification obligations** from this exclusion.  
   - The phrase *""This limitation does not... apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other""* ensures that indemnifiable losses (e.g., third-party claims) are **not subject to the bar on indirect damages**.  

3. **Interaction with the Cap (Section 12.4)**  
   - Despite the carveout for indemnification in Section 12.3, Section 12.4 states that the **monetary cap applies even to indemnification claims** (""whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions"").  
   - Thus, while indemnifiable losses may include consequential damages (per Section 12.3), the **total liability for such claims is still capped** by Section 12.4.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **does not fully carve out indemnification from the liability cap**. Instead:  
  - It allows indemnification for **broader types of damages** (e.g., consequential losses) that would otherwise be excluded under Section 12.3.  
  - But it **subjects those indemnification claims to the aggregate cap** in Section 12.4.  

### External Context (Specific Performance):
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) as carveouts to monetary limits. However, the provided clause does **not** address equitable relief, focusing solely on **monetary liability** and indemnification.  

### Conclusion:
The clause **partially carves out indemnification** (permitting recovery of otherwise excluded damages) but **still caps total liability**, including indemnification claims. For a full carveout, the clause would need to explicitly exclude indemnification from the cap (e.g., *""The cap in Section 12.4 shall not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 12""*).

This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The query asks about an **""indemnification carveout to cap on liability,""** which refers to whether indemnification obligations are excluded from (or ""carved out"" of) a general limitation on liability in a contract.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
The provided clause (**Sections 12.3 and 12.4**) addresses this issue directly:  

1. **No Liability for Consequential Damages (12.3)**  
   - Generally excludes liability for indirect, consequential, or special damages (including lost profits).  
   - **However**, it explicitly **carves out indemnification obligations**, meaning that indemnifiable losses (e.g., third-party claims) are **not** subject to this exclusion.  

2. **Limitation on Liability (12.4)**  
   - Imposes a **monetary cap** on each party’s total liability (""maximum aggregate liability"") for all claims, **regardless of the legal theory** (contract, tort, negligence, etc.).  
   - **Key phrase:** ""whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12.""  
     - This suggests that indemnification claims **are subject to the liability cap** unless another provision explicitly overrides it.  

### **Conclusion:**  
- The clause **partially carves out indemnification** from the exclusion of consequential damages (12.3) but **does not fully exempt indemnification from the overall liability cap** (12.4).  
- If the parties intended indemnification to be **fully excluded** from the liability cap, the clause would need clearer language (e.g., ""Notwithstanding Section 12.4, indemnification obligations shall not be subject to the liability cap"").  

### **External Context (Specific Performance Clauses):**  
The external references (e.g., MAUD 102, MAUD 446) discuss **specific performance** (equitable relief for breaches), which is unrelated to the liability cap/indemnification issue. They emphasize that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches, but they do not affect the interpretation of the indemnification carveout in the given clause.

1. **Exclusion of IP Infringement from Liability Cap**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the general limitations on liability (including caps on damages and exclusions for indirect/consequential damages) **do not apply** to claims arising from **Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)**.  
   - This means that for IP infringement claims:  
     - The **monetary cap** (limiting liability to the amount earned under revenue sharing in the prior 12 months) **does not apply**.  
     - The exclusion of **indirect, punitive, or consequential damages** also **does not apply**, allowing broader recovery for IP-related breaches.  

2. **Alignment with External Context on Equitable Relief**  
   - The referenced external provisions (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 9.10**) emphasize that breaches of the agreement (including IP-related breaches) may warrant **injunctive relief or specific performance** because monetary damages alone may be inadequate.  
   - The IP infringement exception in **Section 9.4** complements this by ensuring that liability for IP breaches is not artificially constrained by the agreement’s standard limitations, preserving the aggrieved party’s ability to seek full remedies (both monetary and equitable).  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause carves out IP infringement from the general liability protections, ensuring that:  
- Claims under **Section 9.3** are **not subject to the monetary cap** or **damage exclusions** that apply to other breaches.  
- This exception aligns with the broader contractual intent to allow robust enforcement of IP rights, including through equitable remedies if needed.

IP infringement exception to cap on liability,395aab365a,"11.3. Liability Cap. Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The **Liability Cap** clause (Section 11.3) is directly relevant to the query about **IP infringement exceptions to the cap on liability**. Here’s how:

1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   The clause establishes a default limit (cap) on liability for claims arising from breaches of the agreement. Specifically, liability is capped at the aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products in the **12 months preceding the claim notification**.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   The clause explicitly carves out three scenarios where the liability cap **does not apply**, meaning liability could be uncapped or higher. The first exception is:  
   - **""(i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property""**.  
     This means that if a party breaches the agreement by misusing the other party’s IP (e.g., unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or infringement of patents/copyrights), the default liability cap **does not protect the breaching party**. The injured party may seek full damages for IP-related breaches, regardless of the 12-month purchase price limit.

3. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   The query focuses on whether IP infringement is an exception to the liability cap. The clause confirms that **IP breaches are excluded from the cap**, aligning with common legal practices where IP violations often carry uncapped liability due to their potential for significant harm (e.g., reputational damage, loss of exclusivity, or statutory penalties).  

4. **Other Exceptions**:  
   For context, the clause also excludes:  
   - **Intentional breaches/willful misconduct** (ii) and  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws** (iii).  
   These reinforce that the cap is designed for ordinary breaches, not egregious or unlawful conduct.

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause explicitly **exempts IP infringement claims from the liability cap**, allowing the IP owner to pursue full remedies (e.g., damages, injunctions) beyond the contractual limitation. This protects IP rights more robustly than other breaches.

### 1. **Exclusion of IP Infringement from Liability Cap**  
The clause explicitly carves out breaches involving **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property (IP)** from both:  
   - The general exclusion of liability for **special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages** (Section 10).  
   - The **monetary cap on liability** (Section 11.3).  

   This means that if a party is liable for IP infringement (e.g., unauthorized use of patents, trademarks, or copyrights), the aggrieved party can seek **full damages** (including consequential, punitive, or other types typically excluded) without being constrained by the liability cap (which otherwise limits recovery to the purchase price paid in the preceding 12 months).  

### 2. **Equitable Remedies Remain Available**  
While the external information (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) emphasizes **injunctive relief** and **specific performance** as remedies for breaches, the clause here confirms that IP infringement claims are **not limited to monetary damages**. Even though the liability cap applies to most breaches, IP breaches allow for:  
   - **Uncapped monetary damages** (due to the exception).  
   - **Equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions to stop further infringement, as noted in the external context).  

### 3. **Alignment with Broader Contractual Intent**  
The clause reinforces the parties’ intent to treat IP breaches as **high-risk violations** warranting stronger protections. This aligns with the external context’s focus on **irreparable harm** (where monetary damages may be inadequate for IP breaches, justifying uncapped liability and equitable relief).  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause ensures that IP infringement claims are **exempt from contractual limitations on liability**, preserving the aggrieved party’s right to pursue **full damages** and **injunctive relief**. This exception reflects the heightened stakes of IP misuse, where standard liability caps could otherwise leave the harmed party undercompensated.

This Section shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.","The clause **""16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY""** is directly relevant to the query regarding an **""IP infringement exception to the cap on liability""** because it explicitly carves out an exception for claims arising from third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **General Limitation of Liability**:  
   The clause states that neither party will be liable for **special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages**—common exclusions in liability caps. This limits the scope of recoverable damages in most scenarios.

2. **Exception for IP Infringement Claims**:  
   The clause **excludes** claims or liabilities arising from **third-party IP infringement** from this limitation. This means:  
   - If one party infringes a third party’s IP (e.g., patents, copyrights, trademarks), the other party **can** seek damages that would otherwise be excluded (e.g., consequential or punitive damages).  
   - The liability cap does **not** apply to IP infringement claims, allowing for broader remedies.  

3. **Connection to External Information**:  
   The external provisions (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) emphasize **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, particularly in contexts like mergers where monetary damages may be inadequate. While those sections focus on enforcement mechanisms, **Section 16** complements them by clarifying that IP infringement claims are **not subject to the same liability restrictions** as other breaches.  

4. **Practical Implications**:  
   - **IP infringement risks are treated as higher-stakes**, warranting uncapped liability.  
   - Parties retain the right to pursue **full remedies** (including non-monetary relief like injunctions, per the external clauses) for IP breaches.  
   - The exception ensures IP owners (or parties indemnifying IP claims) cannot shield themselves from full liability under the general cap.  

**Conclusion**: The clause directly addresses the query by carving out IP infringement from liability limitations, aligning with broader contract principles that treat IP breaches as uniquely significant (as seen in the external provisions). This ensures IP disputes remain enforceable without arbitrary caps.",5

Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### Key Points:
1. **IP Infringement Exception to Liability Cap**  
   - The clause states that the liability cap in **Section 11.3** does **not** apply to:  
     - Breaches associated with the **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property** (Section 11.3(i)).  
     - This means that if a party is found liable for IP infringement (e.g., unauthorized use of patents, copyrights, or trademarks), the **liability cap does not limit damages**, and the liable party could face **uncapped liability**.  

2. **Other Exceptions to the Cap**  
   - The liability cap also does **not** apply to:  
     - **Intentional breaches or willful misconduct** (Section 11.3(ii)).  
     - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws/regulations** (Section 11.3(iii)).  
   - This reinforces that IP infringement is treated similarly to **egregious misconduct**—where the parties agree that standard liability limits should not apply.  

3. **Exclusion of Certain Damages (Section 10)**  
   - The clause also clarifies that **special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages** are generally excluded **except** for:  
     - **IP-related breaches** (explicitly carved out).  
     - **Strict product liability under mandatory law** (e.g., defective products causing harm).  
   - This means that for IP infringement, the injured party **can still seek** these types of damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) despite the general exclusion.  

### Connection to External References:  
The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 10.12(a)**) emphasize that:  
- **Equitable relief (injunctions, specific performance)** is available for breaches, particularly where monetary damages are inadequate.  
- **IP breaches often qualify for such relief** (e.g., stopping unauthorized use via injunction).  
- The liability cap exceptions align with this principle—IP infringement is treated as a **material breach** warranting uncapped damages and equitable remedies.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause confirms that **IP infringement is excluded from the liability cap**, meaning:  
- The injured party can seek **full damages** (not limited by the cap in Section 11.3).  
- They may also pursue **injunctive relief** (per the external references) to stop ongoing infringement.  
- This exception reflects the **high risk and harm** associated with IP misuse, justifying stricter liability.

1. **Exclusion for IP Infringement Liability**  
   - The clause explicitly **excludes liability arising from Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)** from the general limitations on liability.  
   - This means that **claims related to third-party IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations) are not subject to the liability cap** or the exclusion of indirect/consequential damages.  
   - The parties can seek **full damages** for IP infringement claims, even if they exceed the revenue-sharing cap or include indirect losses (e.g., lost profits).

2. **General Liability Cap**  
   - For all other claims (non-IP-related), liability is **capped at the amount earned under Section 5.4 (Revenue Sharing) in the preceding 12 months**.  
   - Indirect, punitive, or consequential damages (e.g., loss of goodwill) are also excluded **unless they stem from IP infringement**.

3. **Connection to External References**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5(c) and Section 9.10**) emphasize **specific performance and injunctive relief** for breaches, particularly where monetary damages are inadequate.  
   - Since IP infringement often causes **irreparable harm**, these provisions reinforce that **equitable remedies (like injunctions) remain available** despite the liability cap in Section 9.4.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause confirms that:  
- **IP infringement claims bypass the liability cap** and can include consequential damages.  
- For non-IP breaches, liability is strictly limited.  
- The external clauses support **additional equitable remedies** for IP-related breaches, ensuring robust protection beyond monetary caps.  

This structure ensures that **IP risks are treated as a high-priority exception**, aligning with the broader legal principle that IP violations often warrant uncapped liability due to their potential for severe, irreversible harm.",5

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Cap on Liability**:  
   The clause states that **neither party will be liable** for certain types of damages (e.g., indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental) **unless** an exception applies.  

2. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement**:  
   The carve-out specifies that claims or liabilities **arising from third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement** are **excluded from this limitation**.  
   - This means if one party is sued by a third party for IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations), the other party **can still be held liable** for the full scope of damages, including indirect or consequential losses that would otherwise be capped.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause explicitly **prioritizes third-party IP claims** over general liability limitations, recognizing that such claims often involve significant risks (e.g., lawsuits, injunctions, or statutory damages) that standard caps don’t adequately address.  
- It aligns with the broader contractual intent seen in the **external references** (e.g., Sections 9.10 and 8.5), where parties emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches, particularly when monetary remedies are insufficient. Here, IP infringement risks likely justify uncapped liability to ensure accountability.  

### Practical Implications:
- A party accused of enabling third-party IP infringement (e.g., by distributing infringing technology) could face **unlimited liability**, while other breaches might be subject to the agreement’s standard damages cap.  
- This exception ensures that IP-related risks are treated with heightened seriousness, reflecting their potential to disrupt business operations or trigger costly litigation.  

In summary, the clause **modifies the liability cap** to account for the unique severity of third-party IP claims, ensuring they remain fully actionable despite general limitations on damages.",5

### Key Points:  
1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause limits the total liability of one party to the other for breaches of the agreement to the aggregate purchase prices paid in the **preceding 12 months**.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Including Third-Party IP Infringement)**:  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:

     - Intentional breaches or willful misconduct (Section 11.3(ii)).  
     - Non-compliance with mandatory laws (Section 11.3(iii)).  

3. **Relevance to Third-Party IP Infringement**:  
   - If a party is found liable for **infringing a third party’s IP rights** (e.g., using unlicensed IP, violating patents, copyrights, or trademarks), the liability **will not be subject to the cap**.  
   - This means the injured party can seek **full damages** (not just the capped amount) for such breaches.  

### Why This Matters:  
- The clause ensures that **IP-related risks** (which can involve significant legal exposure) are **not artificially limited** by the agreement’s general liability cap.  
- It aligns with common legal practice where **IP infringement claims** are treated as **high-risk exposures** that warrant uncapped liability.  

### External Context (if applicable):  
While the provided external references (from **Section 10.3**) discuss termination fees and acquisition proposals, they do not directly relate to the **liability cap or IP exceptions**. The key answer is derived from **Clause 11.3** itself.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause confirms that **third-party IP infringement claims are excluded from the liability cap**, meaning a party can be held fully liable for damages arising from such breaches.",5
third party IP infringement exception to cap on liability,0bb5a9f842,"16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind. This Section shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.","The clause **""16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY""** is directly relevant to the query regarding a **third-party IP infringement exception to the cap on liability** in the following ways:

1. **General Limitation of Liability** – The clause broadly limits liability by stating that neither party will be liable for **special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages**, except in specific cases.  

2. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement** – The clause explicitly **carves out an exception** for claims or liabilities arising from **third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement**. This means:  
   - If a party is sued for IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations) by a third party due to the other party’s actions, the **liability cap does not apply**.  
   - The infringing party could be held fully liable for **all damages** (including indirect, consequential, or punitive damages) related to the IP claim.  

3. **Survival Clause** – The provision remains in effect even after the agreement terminates or expires, ensuring that the limitation (and its exception) continues to apply post-termination.  

### Relevance to External Information:  
While the external excerpts discuss **specific performance and injunctive relief** (rather than liability caps), they reinforce that:  
- **Equitable remedies** (like injunctions) are preserved even where monetary damages are limited.  
- **IP-related breaches** may justify exceptions to liability limitations, as IP disputes often involve irreparable harm (aligning with the carve-out in Clause 16).  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause ensures that while most liabilities are capped, **IP infringement risks remain fully exposed**, protecting the non-infringing party from bearing undue risk. This is critical in agreements involving technology, licensing, or proprietary assets where third-party IP claims are a significant concern.",5

Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The clause is directly relevant to the query regarding a **""third party IP infringement exception to the cap on liability""** in the following ways:

1. **Explicit Exception for Unauthorized IP Use**:  
   - Both **Section 10 (Indemnities)** and **Section 11.3 (Liability Cap)** explicitly exclude breaches related to the **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property (IP)** from the general limitations on liability.  
   - This means that if a party is liable for third-party IP infringement (e.g., using another party's IP without authorization), the **monetary cap on liability** (defined in Section 11.3) **does not apply**. The liable party could be exposed to **full damages**, including special, consequential, or punitive damages, which would otherwise be excluded or capped under the agreement.

2. **Broader Context of Liability Exceptions**:  
   - The clause carves out **three key exceptions** to the liability cap:  
     (i) Unauthorized IP use,  
     (ii) Intentional breach/willful misconduct, and  
     (iii) Non-compliance with mandatory laws.  
   - The **IP infringement exception** is treated similarly to intentional misconduct or legal violations, indicating its severity.  

3. **Alignment with Equitable Remedies**:  
   - The external references (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) emphasize that **equitable remedies** (like injunctions) are available for breaches, especially where monetary damages are inadequate.  
   - For IP infringement, this reinforces that the non-breaching party may seek **injunctive relief** (to stop unauthorized use) **in addition to** uncapped monetary damages.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause ensures that **third-party IP infringement claims are not subject to the liability cap**, preserving the aggrieved party’s right to recover full damages and seek injunctive relief. This reflects the high stakes and potential reputational/legal risks associated with IP violations.",5
"liability cap clauses that exclude third party IP infringement and fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct",a818258b71,"9.4 LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM SECTION 9.3 [Intellectual Property Infringement], IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.

### **1. Exclusion of Third-Party IP Infringement Liability**  
- The clause explicitly **carves out liability arising from Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)** from the general liability cap.  
- This means that while most liabilities are capped (e.g., indirect, consequential, or punitive damages), **claims related to third-party IP infringement (covered under Section 9.3) are not subject to the same limitation**.  
- Thus, the clause **excludes third-party IP infringement from the liability cap**, aligning with the query’s focus on such exclusions.

### **2. No Explicit Exclusion for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
- The clause does **not** explicitly mention fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct as exceptions to the liability cap.  
- This implies that **such claims may still be subject to the liability limitations** (unless another section of the agreement or applicable law overrides this).  
- If the query seeks a clause that **excludes** fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct from liability caps, this clause **does not fully address that requirement**—it only excludes IP infringement.  

### **3. General Liability Cap Structure**  
- The clause imposes two key limitations:  
  - **No liability for indirect/consequential damages** (unless under Section 9.3).  
  - **Liability capped at the amount earned in the preceding 12 months** (again, except for IP infringement claims).  
- This structure reinforces that **IP infringement is treated differently** from other liabilities, while other exclusions (like fraud) are not explicitly addressed.  

### **Comparison with External References**  
The external references (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 9.10**) discuss **specific performance and equitable relief**, which are separate from liability caps. They emphasize that monetary damages may not suffice for breaches, but they do not directly interact with the liability cap clause in question.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **partially relevant** to the query because:  
✅ It **excludes third-party IP infringement** from the liability cap (matching part of the query).  
❌ It **does not explicitly exclude fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (missing part of the query).  

If the query seeks a **comprehensive exclusion** of all three categories (IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence/willful misconduct), this clause would need to be supplemented with additional language or another section addressing the missing exclusions.",4
"liability cap clauses that exclude third party IP infringement and fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct",a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The provided clause is relevant to the query in the following ways:  

1. **Exclusion of Third-Party IP Infringement Liability**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the liability cap **does not apply** to claims arising from third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement.  
   - This aligns with the query's requirement that liability caps should **exclude** third-party IP infringement claims, meaning such claims remain fully actionable.  

2. **Limitation on Indirect, Consequential, and Punitive Damages**  
   - The clause caps liability for **special, indirect, consequential, and punitive damages**, which are typically excluded in standard liability limitations.  
   - However, it does **not** explicitly mention exclusions for **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**, which are often carved out in stronger liability limitation clauses.  

3. **Comparison with External Information**  
   - The external references discuss **specific performance** and **equitable remedies**, reinforcing that certain breaches (like IP infringement or fraud) may warrant injunctive relief beyond monetary caps.  
   - The clause here does not conflict with those principles but focuses on **limiting financial exposure** while keeping IP infringement claims outside the cap.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause partially addresses the query by excluding third-party IP infringement from the liability cap but does **not** explicitly exclude fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. A more comprehensive clause might include those additional carve-outs.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Liability Cap Structure**  
The clause explicitly imposes a **monetary cap** on liability (Section 11.3), limiting claims to the aggregate purchase prices paid during the 12 months preceding the claim. This is a standard liability cap mechanism to mitigate financial exposure.

### 2. **Exclusions from the Cap**  
The clause carves out exceptions where the liability cap **does not apply**, aligning with the query’s focus on excluded categories:  
   - **Third-party IP infringement**:  
     - Section 10 (referenced in 11.3) preserves liability for breaches related to ""unauthorized use of Intellectual Property.""  
     - Section 11.3(i) reiterates this exclusion for IP breaches.  
   - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**:  
     - Section 11.3(ii) excludes liability arising from ""intentional breach or willful misconduct,"" covering fraud and gross negligence (which often falls under willful misconduct in legal interpretation).  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws**:  
     - Section 11.3(iii) excludes liability for violations of mandatory laws/regulations, which may include statutory fraud or IP violations.  

### 3. **Additional Context from External Information**  
The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, reinforcing that certain actions (like IP infringement or willful misconduct) may bypass monetary caps entirely and warrant specific performance or injunctive relief. This aligns with the carve-outs in the clause.  

### 4. **Drafting Intent**  
The clause balances risk allocation:  
   - **Caps liability** for ordinary breaches (e.g., contractual failures).  
   - **Preserves unlimited liability** for egregious acts (fraud, willful misconduct) and IP violations, ensuring parties remain accountable for intentional or legally non-waivable harms.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause directly addresses the query by:  
1. Imposing a liability cap for general breaches.  
2. Explicitly **excluding** IP infringement, willful misconduct (encompassing fraud/gross negligence), and statutory violations from the cap.  
3. Aligning with broader legal principles (e.g., equitable remedies for irreparable harms like IP breaches).  

This structure is common in contracts to ensure fairness while complying with mandatory laws (e.g., non-waivable liability for fraud or IP violations).",5

11.3. Liability Cap. Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The clause provided is highly relevant to the query regarding **liability cap clauses that exclude third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Liability Cap Structure**  
The clause (Section 11.3) establishes a **monetary cap** on liability for breaches of the agreement, limiting it to the aggregate purchase prices paid during the **12 months preceding the claim**. This is a typical liability cap mechanism to manage financial exposure.

### 2. **Exclusions from the Cap**  
The clause explicitly **excludes** certain categories of liability from the cap, aligning with the query’s focus:  
   - **Third-party IP infringement**: The cap does not apply to breaches involving ""unauthorized use of Intellectual Property"" (Section 10 and 11.3(i)).  
   - **Willful misconduct/intentional breach**: Liability arising from ""intentional breach or willful misconduct"" is excluded (11.3(ii)).  
   - **Gross negligence/non-compliance**: The cap excludes liability for ""non-compliance with mandatory applicable law or regulation"" (11.3(iii)), which could encompass gross negligence if such non-compliance is reckless or intentional.  

   *(Note: While ""fraud"" is not explicitly mentioned, ""willful misconduct"" may cover fraudulent acts depending on jurisdiction and interpretation.)*

### 3. **Additional Context from External Information**  
The external references (e.g., *Maud_102* and *Maud_417*) highlight that parties retain rights to **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, even where liability caps apply. This reinforces that exclusions for misconduct/IP infringement are critical because:  
   - Such breaches may warrant remedies beyond monetary damages (e.g., stopping unauthorized IP use).  
   - The cap is not intended to shield bad-faith actions or violations of law.  

### 4. **Alignment with Query**  
The clause directly addresses the query by:  
   - Capping general liability but **carving out exceptions** for IP infringement, willful misconduct, and legal non-compliance.  
   - Implicitly covering **gross negligence** through the ""non-compliance with mandatory law"" exclusion (if such non-compliance is reckless).  
   - Preserving remedies for egregious acts, consistent with the external examples’ emphasis on equitable relief.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause is a clear example of a **qualified liability cap** that balances risk allocation while excluding high-stakes misconduct (IP infringement, willful acts, and legal violations) from limitation—precisely the focus of the query.",5
"liability cap clauses that exclude third party IP infringement and fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct",b1598370cd,"9.5 Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT (I) IN THE EVENT OF THE FRAUD OF A PARTY OR OF A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 7 (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) OR ARTICLE 10 (CONFIDENTIALITY), OR (II) TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO A THIRD PARTY AS PART OF A CLAIM FOR WHICH A PARTY PROVIDES INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE 9, NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR SUBLICENSEES SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, REMOTE, EXEMPLARY OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES OR OTHER DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT PROBABLE AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THAT PARTY OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, OR OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED THE POSSIBILITY OF, ANY SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE; PROVIDED, FOR CLARITY, [***]. ARTICLE 10","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 9.5)** is directly relevant to the query regarding **liability cap exclusions for third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** in the following ways:

### **1. Exclusions from Liability Cap**  
The clause explicitly **excludes** certain categories from the general limitation of liability, meaning that liability remains **uncapped** for:  
- **Fraud** (""in the event of the fraud of a party"")  
- **Breach of IP obligations** (Article 7, covering third-party IP infringement risks)  
- **Breach of confidentiality** (Article 10)  
- **Indemnified third-party claims** (damages paid to third parties under Article 9 indemnification)  

This aligns with the query’s focus on **excluding fraud and third-party IP infringement** from liability limitations.  

### **2. Scope of Limited Liability**  
For all other claims (e.g., ordinary negligence, breach of contract), liability is **capped** to exclude:  
- Indirect, consequential, punitive, or speculative damages  
- Damages that are not ""probable and reasonably foreseeable""  

This reinforces that **gross negligence or willful misconduct** (if not explicitly carved out) could still fall under the general cap, unless interpreted as fraud or a breach of excluded obligations.  

### **3. Interaction with External Context**  
The referenced external clauses (e.g., **specific performance, injunctive relief**) suggest that breaches of key obligations (like IP or confidentiality) may also trigger **equitable remedies**, further supporting uncapped liability for excluded acts.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause **partially addresses the query** by:  
- Clearly **excluding fraud and third-party IP infringement** from liability caps.  
- Not explicitly mentioning **gross negligence or willful misconduct**, leaving potential ambiguity (unless covered under fraud or indemnified claims).  
- Reinforcing that **indemnified third-party claims** bypass the cap.  

For full alignment with the query, the clause might need **explicit exclusions for gross negligence/willful misconduct** unless those are already subsumed under fraud or indemnification.

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The **""personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap""** query seeks to understand whether claims related to personal or bodily injury are excluded from the liability cap specified in the agreement.  

### Relevance of the Clause to the Query:  
The **Limitation of Liability (Section 9)** clause defines the maximum liability (**Liability Cap**) that one party can claim against the other, but it also lists **exceptions** where the cap does not apply.  

1. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1 & 9.1.2):**  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - **Material confidentiality breaches (Section 5)**  
     - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**  
     - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence**  

2. **Definition of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2):**  
   - The clause broadly defines liability to include claims arising from **contract, tort (including negligence), equity, or statute**.  
   - **Personal/bodily injury claims** typically fall under **tort law (e.g., negligence, gross negligence, or intentional harm).**  

### Key Implications for Personal/Bodily Injury Claims:  
- If a personal/bodily injury claim arises from **gross negligence or intentional misconduct**, the **Liability Cap does not apply** (Section 9.1.2).  
- If the injury claim is based on **ordinary negligence**, the Liability Cap **may still apply** (unless another exception, like indemnification, covers it).  
- If the injury is tied to a **material confidentiality breach or indemnifiable event**, the cap **does not apply** (Section 9.1.1).  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **partially addresses** the query by excluding **gross negligence and intentional misconduct** from the Liability Cap, which could cover severe personal injury claims. However, it does **not explicitly mention bodily injury** as a standalone exception. Thus, whether such claims are capped depends on the **legal basis** (e.g., negligence vs. gross negligence) and whether they fall under indemnification or another exception.  

For stronger clarity, the agreement could explicitly state whether **personal/bodily injury claims** are excluded from the cap, similar to how confidentiality breaches and indemnification are treated.

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.

### 1. **General Liability Cap (Section 9.1)**  
   - The clause imposes a maximum liability cap (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the Agreement.  
   - However, this cap does **not** apply in certain exceptions, such as:  
     - Material confidentiality breaches (Section 5)  
     - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)  
     - **Intentional misconduct or gross negligence (Section 9.1.2)**  

### 2. **Relevance to Personal/Bodily Injury**  
   - While the clause does **not explicitly mention** personal or bodily injury, such claims could fall under **tort liability** (e.g., negligence, gross negligence, or intentional harm).  
   - If bodily injury results from **gross negligence or intentional misconduct**, the Liability Cap **would not apply** (Section 9.1.2).  
   - If injury arises from ordinary negligence, the Liability Cap **may still apply**, unless another exception (e.g., indemnification) covers it.  

### 3. **Definition of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**  
   - The broad definition includes claims arising from **""tort (including negligence)""**, meaning personal injury claims could be covered.  
   - However, unless the injury is tied to **gross negligence, intentional harm, or an indemnifiable event**, the Liability Cap would limit recovery.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause does **not explicitly exclude bodily injury** from the Liability Cap, but if such injury results from **gross negligence or intentional misconduct**, the cap would not apply. For ordinary negligence claims, the cap may still limit liability unless another exception (e.g., indemnification) is triggered.  

If the parties intend to **fully exclude bodily injury** from the Liability Cap, an **explicit exception** should be added (e.g., *""The Liability Cap shall not apply to claims for personal or bodily injury, whether arising from negligence or otherwise.""*).

personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap,e156a5b7c4,"28.2. Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The clause you provided (Section 28.2) is directly relevant to the query about a **""personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap""** because it explicitly carves out an exception to the general limitation of liability for claims involving **personal injury or death caused by negligence**.

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **General Liability Cap**:  
   The clause states that liability for breaches of the agreement (whether due to negligence, wilful misconduct, or other causes) is generally **capped at the total payments made under the agreement**. This means neither party can claim more than this amount for typical breaches.

2. **Exception for Personal Injury/Death**:  
   However, the clause **excludes** claims for **personal injury or death caused by negligence** from this liability cap. This means:  
   - If a party’s negligence results in bodily harm or death, the injured party can seek damages **without being restricted by the contractual liability cap**.  
   - Such claims would likely be governed by **applicable tort law**, which may impose no statutory limits on compensation for personal injury or wrongful death.

3. **Legal Basis for the Exception**:  
   The clause acknowledges that certain liabilities (like personal injury) **cannot be contractually limited by law** (e.g., under common law principles or statutes like the UK’s Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 or similar regimes in other jurisdictions). This ensures the clause remains enforceable while respecting mandatory legal protections for bodily harm.

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts (Sections 9.10 and 8.5) discuss **specific performance** and equitable remedies for breaches, they do not directly address liability caps or personal injury exceptions. However, they reinforce that:  
- Courts may prioritize **enforcing contractual terms** (e.g., via injunctions) but will not override statutory or common law protections (like those for personal injury).  
- The liability cap’s exception aligns with the broader principle that **certain harms (e.g., bodily injury) cannot be remedied solely by monetary compensation**—hence the carve-out.

### Practical Implications:  
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause incentivizes parties to exercise due care to avoid negligence leading to injury, as liability for such acts is uncapped.  
- **Compliance**: It ensures the contract respects **non-waivable legal rights** related to personal injury, avoiding potential invalidation of the entire limitation clause.  

In summary, this clause explicitly answers the query by confirming that **personal injury/death claims due to negligence are excluded from the liability cap**, reflecting both contractual intent and legal necessity.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap,0ee4ee1e83,"14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
14.1 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, THAT ARE IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 14.1)** in the contract excludes certain types of damages (indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary) from being claimed by either party under the agreement. However, the **query about a ""personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap""** suggests an interest in whether liability for physical harm (e.g., personal injury) is also limited by this clause or if such claims are exempt.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Scope of the Limitation Clause**:  
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for *financial or economic* damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential losses) but does **not** mention *personal or bodily injury*.  
   - Under many legal systems, liability for physical harm (e.g., negligence causing injury) cannot be contractually waived or capped unless explicitly stated. Absent an explicit exclusion, courts may interpret this clause as **not applying to bodily injury claims**.  

2. **Comparison with External Context**:  
   - The provided external clauses (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) focus on *equitable remedies* (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not address personal injury.  
   - If the parties intended to cap liability for bodily injury, the contract would likely include:  
     - A carve-out (e.g., ""Except for liability arising from gross negligence or personal injury"").  
     - A separate indemnity clause for physical harm.  

3. **Legal Implications**:  
   - Without an explicit exception, personal injury claims may fall outside this limitation, meaning a party could still be sued for bodily injury despite Section 14.1.  
   - Statutory law (e.g., workplace safety laws) often overrides contractual limitations for physical harm.  

### Suggested Action:  
To address the query definitively:  
- Review the contract for:  
  - A **""carve-out"" clause** exempting personal injury from liability limits.  
  - An **indemnity section** covering third-party bodily injury claims.  
- Confirm whether applicable law (e.g., tort law) voids such limitations for physical harm.  

In summary, **Section 14.1 likely does not limit liability for personal/bodily injury** unless the contract explicitly states otherwise. The clause primarily targets financial damages.",5

<omitted>
11. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.","The **""Limitation on Liability"" clause (Section 10)** is relevant to the query about a **""personal or bodily injury exception to the liability cap""** in the following ways:

1. **General Limitation on Liability**:  
   The clause broadly limits liability by excluding **special, incidental, consequential damages, and lost profits**—even if arising from negligence—unless there is a **breach of Section 11 (Confidential Information)**. This suggests that the parties intended to cap most forms of damages.

2. **Absence of Explicit Exception for Personal/Bodily Injury**:  
   - The clause does **not** explicitly mention **personal injury, bodily injury, or death** as exceptions to the liability cap.  
   - Many contracts (especially in high-risk industries) include carve-outs for **gross negligence, willful misconduct, or personal injury**, but this clause does not appear to do so.  

3. **Potential Legal Implications**:  
   - If a claim arises for **personal/bodily injury**, a court may interpret whether such damages fall under **""special, incidental, or consequential damages""** (which are excluded).  
   - Some jurisdictions **do not enforce liability waivers for personal injury** caused by negligence, meaning this clause may be **partially or fully unenforceable** for such claims.  

4. **Comparison with External References**:  
   - The external references (e.g., **Section 11.13 on Specific Performance**) discuss **equitable remedies** (injunctions) but do not address liability caps for personal injury.  
   - This reinforces that the contract may **lack an express exception** for bodily harm, leaving room for legal interpretation.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **does not explicitly exclude personal/bodily injury** from the liability cap, which could lead to disputes over enforceability. If such claims arise, their validity may depend on:  
- Applicable law (e.g., some states prohibit waivers for negligence-related injuries).  
- Judicial interpretation of whether bodily injury is considered a form of ""consequential damage.""

9 Limitation of Liability.
9.1 The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party and its affiliates in relation to this Agreement will be [***] (""Liability Cap""), provided however that:
9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause is directly relevant to the query regarding **""confidentiality exceptions to liability cap""** because it explicitly outlines two key scenarios where the agreed **Liability Cap** (the maximum liability one party can incur under the agreement) **does not apply**, one of which pertains to confidentiality breaches. Here’s the breakdown:

### 1. **Confidentiality Breach Exception (Section 9.1.1)**  
   - The Liability Cap **will not apply** to **material breaches of confidentiality** under **Section 5** of the agreement.  
   - This means that if a party materially breaches its confidentiality obligations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information), the other party can seek damages **beyond the capped amount**, potentially exposing the breaching party to unlimited liability for such breaches.  
   - *Rationale*: Confidentiality breaches can cause irreparable harm (as highlighted in the external information, where equitable relief like injunctions is emphasized for breaches). The exception ensures that parties are fully accountable for such breaches, aligning with the broader legal principle that monetary caps should not shield egregious or harmful conduct.

### 2. **Other Exceptions to the Liability Cap**  
   - The clause also carves out exceptions for:  
     - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**: Typically tied to third-party claims or specific risks (e.g., IP infringement).  
     - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence (Section 9.1.2)**: Acts beyond mere negligence, reflecting heightened culpability.  

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - The query focuses on **confidentiality-related exceptions**, and the clause explicitly addresses this by excluding material confidentiality breaches from the Liability Cap.  
   - The external information (e.g., irreparable harm justifying equitable relief) supports why confidentiality breaches are treated severely—monetary caps may not suffice to deter or remedy such breaches.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause ensures that parties cannot hide behind the Liability Cap for serious breaches (like confidentiality violations), preserving the right to seek full remedies. This aligns with common contractual and legal practices where caps exclude fiduciary duties, fraud, or breaches causing disproportionate harm.

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause is directly relevant to the query about **""confidentiality exceptions to liability cap""** because it explicitly outlines the circumstances under which the Liability Cap does not apply, including breaches of confidentiality. Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Confidentiality Breach Exception (Section 9.1.1)**  
   - The Liability Cap **does not apply** to ""material confidentiality breaches"" under **Section 5** of the Agreement.  
   - This means that if a party materially breaches its confidentiality obligations, the other party can seek damages **beyond the capped amount** (e.g., [***]) for losses caused by the breach.  
   - The exception underscores the heightened importance of confidentiality, treating it as a carve-out from general liability limitations.

2. **Additional Exceptions Reinforcing Confidentiality Protections**  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**: Claims tied to indemnity (e.g., third-party claims) are also uncapped, which may indirectly cover confidentiality breaches if they trigger indemnification.  
   - **Intentional misconduct/gross negligence (Section 9.1.2)**: If a confidentiality breach results from willful or reckless behavior, the Liability Cap is waived entirely.  

3. **Broad Definition of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**  
   - The clause defines liability expansively (covering damages, attorney fees, statutory claims, etc.), ensuring that uncapped claims for confidentiality breaches include all foreseeable losses.  

### Connection to External Context:  
The external provisions (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **10.12(a)**) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, including confidentiality. While those sections address **enforcement mechanisms**, the Limitation of Liability clause here clarifies the **monetary consequences** of breaches—confirming that confidentiality breaches are treated as high-risk, warranting uncapped liability.  

### Practical Implications:  
- A party suffering a material confidentiality breach can pursue **full recovery** (not limited by the cap) and may also seek injunctive relief (per external clauses).  
- The clause acts as a deterrent against mishandling confidential information by removing financial liability limits for such breaches.  

In summary, the clause directly answers the query by **exempting material confidentiality breaches from the Liability Cap**, aligning with the broader agreement’s emphasis on protecting sensitive information through both monetary and equitable remedies.",5

### 1. **Confidentiality Agreement Exceptions**  
The clause explicitly carves out exceptions to the liability cap for breaches related to the **Confidentiality Agreement**. Specifically:  
   - **Section 10 (Indemnities)** and the parties' obligations under the **Confidentiality Agreement** are excluded from the liability cap (stated in both the indemnity clause and Section 11.3).  
   - This means that claims arising from breaches of confidentiality (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of confidential information) are **not subject to the monetary cap** on liability.  

### 2. **Other Key Exceptions to the Liability Cap**  
The clause also highlights additional exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, which indirectly reinforce the importance of confidentiality and other critical obligations:  
   - **Unauthorized use of Intellectual Property**: Breaches involving IP misuse are excluded from the cap, aligning with confidentiality concerns (e.g., trade secrets).  
   - **Intentional breach or willful misconduct**: Deliberate violations (including confidentiality breaches) are uncapped.  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws**: Regulatory breaches (e.g., data protection laws) are also uncapped, which may overlap with confidentiality obligations.  

### 3. **Equitable Remedies for Confidentiality Breaches**  
The **external information** (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) underscores that parties retain the right to seek **injunctive relief or specific performance** for breaches, even if monetary damages are capped. This is particularly relevant for confidentiality breaches, where monetary compensation may be inadequate (e.g., irreparable harm from leaked trade secrets).  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause confirms that:  
- The liability cap **does not apply** to breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement.  
- Parties can pursue **uncapped damages** or **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for confidentiality violations, ensuring robust protection beyond the standard monetary limits.

### 1. **Confidentiality Agreement Exceptions**  
The clause explicitly carves out exceptions to the liability cap for breaches related to the **Confidentiality Agreement**. Specifically:
   - **Section 10 (Indemnities)** and the **Confidentiality Agreement** are excluded from the liability cap, meaning breaches of confidentiality obligations are not subject to the monetary limitations imposed by the liability cap.  
   - This ensures that confidentiality breaches (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information) can result in uncapped liability, even if other breaches of the agreement are subject to the cap.

### 2. **Unauthorized Use of Intellectual Property**  
The clause also excludes liability for **unauthorized use of Intellectual Property (IP)** from the cap, which often overlaps with confidentiality breaches (e.g., misuse of trade secrets or proprietary information). This reinforces that IP-related breaches, including those under confidentiality obligations, are treated more severely.

### 3. **Additional Exceptions to the Cap**  
The liability cap (Section 11.3) further excludes:  
   - **Intentional breaches or willful misconduct** (which could include deliberate confidentiality violations).  
   - **Non-compliance with mandatory laws** (e.g., data protection laws that may govern confidential information).  

### 4. **Equitable Remedies for Confidentiality Breaches**  
The external references (e.g., MAUD_102 and MAUD_417) highlight that parties retain the right to seek **injunctive relief or specific performance** for breaches, including confidentiality breaches, even if monetary damages are capped for other claims. This aligns with the clause’s carve-out for confidentiality obligations, ensuring equitable remedies remain available.

### **Conclusion**  
The clause confirms that:  
- **Confidentiality breaches are not subject to the liability cap**, allowing for uncapped damages.  
- **IP breaches, intentional misconduct, and legal violations** are also excluded, which may overlap with confidentiality issues.  
- **Non-monetary remedies (e.g., injunctions)** remain enforceable for confidentiality breaches, as supported by the external references.  

This structure ensures that confidentiality obligations are treated as high-stakes commitments, with stronger consequences than general breaches of the agreement.",5

The provided **clause** (Section 10) explicitly addresses this by carving out exceptions to the general limitations of liability for breaches of confidentiality obligations and indemnification obligations. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Confidentiality as an Exception to Liability Caps**  
   - The clause states that **neither party’s liability is capped** (under Section 10.1) or excluded (under Section 10.2) for:  
     - **Violations of confidentiality obligations** (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information).  
     - **Indemnification obligations** (e.g., claims covered by indemnity provisions).  
   - This means breaches of confidentiality are **exempt from the monetary limits** (e.g., fees paid under the agreement) and **exclusions** (e.g., no bar on claiming consequential damages) that otherwise apply to other types of claims.

2. **Uncapped Liability for Confidentiality Breaches**  
   - Normally, liability is limited to the **fees paid under the agreement** (Section 10.1) and **consequential/punitive damages are excluded** (Section 10.2).  
   - However, for confidentiality breaches:  
     - The liable party **could owe damages beyond the fee cap**.  
     - **Consequential, indirect, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits due to leaked trade secrets) **may be recoverable**, even if they’re otherwise excluded.  

3. **Alignment with External Context**  
   - The external references (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) emphasize that breaches of key obligations (like confidentiality) may justify **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions)** and are treated as **irreparable harm**, further underscoring why liability caps wouldn’t apply.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause explicitly confirms that **confidentiality breaches are treated more severely** than other breaches, allowing aggrieved parties to:  
- Seek **full damages** (not limited by the fee cap).  
- Potentially claim **consequential/lost profits damages** (otherwise barred).  
- Pursue **injunctive relief** (per the external references, if confidentiality is threatened).  

This creates a strong deterrent against confidentiality violations and ensures robust protection for sensitive information.  

**Summary**: The clause directly answers the query by stating that confidentiality breaches are **exempt from liability limitations**, exposing violators to uncapped and broader damages.",5

9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause is directly relevant to the query regarding a **""fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct carveout to a liability cap""** in the following ways:

1. **Carveout for Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**  
   - Section 9.1.2 explicitly states that the Liability Cap **does not apply** to liabilities arising from **intentional misconduct** and/or **gross negligence**.  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on exceptions to liability limits for **fraud (intentional misconduct)** and **gross negligence**.  

2. **Exclusion for Material Confidentiality Breaches and Indemnification**  
   - Section 9.1.1 further carves out **material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5)** and **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** from the Liability Cap.  
   - While not directly addressing fraud or negligence, this reinforces that certain high-stakes breaches (e.g., willful disclosure of confidential information) are treated as exceptions to liability limits.  

3. **Broad Definition of Liability**  
   - Section 9.2 defines ""liability"" expansively to cover claims arising from **contract, tort (including negligence), equity, or statutory violations**, ensuring the carveouts in 9.1.1–9.1.2 apply to all forms of culpable conduct.  

### Relevance to External Information  
The external clauses (e.g., *Section 8.5(c)* and *Section 10.12(a)*) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, but they do not conflict with the Liability Cap clause. Instead, they complement it by:  
- Confirming that **non-monetary remedies** (e.g., specific performance) remain available even if liability is capped for ordinary breaches.  
- Implicitly supporting the carveout logic: if **fraud/gross negligence** justifies equitable relief, it logically also justifies uncapped liability.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause **explicitly excludes intentional misconduct and gross negligence** from the Liability Cap, directly addressing the query. It ensures that parties remain fully liable for egregious acts (fraud/willful misconduct) or severe negligence, while capping liability for ordinary breaches.

The provided clause (**Section 9: Limitation of Liability**) directly addresses this issue by outlining exceptions to the Liability Cap, including carveouts for **intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence**. Here’s the relevance:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Liability Cap**: The clause sets a maximum liability limit ([***]) for claims arising under the Agreement.  
2. **Carveouts to the Cap**: The cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2).  
   - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5) and indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).  

3. **Definition of Liability**: Broadly covers claims, damages, and costs arising from contract, tort (including negligence), statute, etc.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- **Fraud/Willful Misconduct**: While the clause explicitly mentions ""intentional misconduct"" (synonymous with willful misconduct), it does not expressly cite ""fraud."" However, fraud typically falls under intentional misconduct or gross negligence in legal interpretation, suggesting it would likely be carved out.  
- **Negligence**: The clause excludes **gross negligence** (a higher standard than ordinary negligence) from the cap. Ordinary negligence is not explicitly excluded, implying it may be subject to the cap unless another provision overrides this.  
- **Equitable Remedies**: The external information (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) highlights that equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) is available for breaches, but this is separate from monetary liability under the cap.  

### Practical Implications:
- Parties cannot limit liability for **intentional/grossly negligent acts** (including fraud or willful misconduct).  
- The cap remains enforceable for ordinary negligence unless contradicted by other terms (e.g., indemnification or confidentiality breaches).  

### Drafting Consideration:
To fully address the query, ensure:  
1. **Fraud** is explicitly listed in the carveout (if intended), as some jurisdictions treat it separately from intentional misconduct.  
2. Clarify whether **ordinary negligence** is capped (the current clause suggests it is).  

This clause aligns with market standards where liability caps exclude egregious conduct (gross negligence/intentional acts) but may leave ambiguity on fraud or ordinary negligence.",5

Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Carveout for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - Both **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** include exceptions where the liability cap and exclusion of consequential damages **do not apply**.  
   - Specifically, subsection (E) in Section 11.6 and subsection (V) in Section 11.7 state that claims arising from a party’s **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are **exempt** from the limitations on liability.  
   - This means a party can seek **full damages** (including consequential, indirect, or other otherwise excluded damages) if the other party’s conduct falls under these carveouts.

2. **Impact on Liability Cap**  
   - The general cap on liability in Section 11.7 (e.g., ""[***]"") does **not apply** to claims involving fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.  
   - Similarly, the prohibition on consequential damages in Section 11.6 is lifted for these carveouts, allowing recovery of otherwise excluded categories of damages (e.g., lost profits).  

3. **Alignment with External Context**  
   - The external references (e.g., Sections 10.12 in MAUD) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches, but the clause here focuses on **monetary liability**.  
   - The carveout ensures that **intentional or egregious misconduct** (fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct) is not shielded by contractual liability limits, preserving the injured party’s right to full legal recourse.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Deterrence**: Parties cannot rely on liability caps to evade accountability for intentional or reckless wrongdoing.  
- **Risk Allocation**: Ordinary breaches are subject to capped damages, but severe misconduct exposes the breaching party to uncapped liability.  
- **Enforceability**: Such carveouts are common in contracts to ensure fairness and compliance with public policy (as courts often refuse to enforce limits on liability for fraud or willful misconduct).  

In summary, the clause directly addresses the query by **excluding fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from liability limitations**, ensuring these acts are fully actionable.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Provisions Addressing the Query:
1. **Carveouts to Liability Limitations**  
   - **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** both exclude certain categories from the general cap on liability and consequential damages. Specifically, they carve out:  
     - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsections (E) in 11.6 and (V) in 11.7).  
     - This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the liability cap and consequential damages waiver **do not apply**, exposing the offending party to full liability.  

2. **Indemnification Obligations**  
   - **Articles 12.1 and 12.2** further reinforce this carveout by requiring indemnification for losses arising from:  
     - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (subsections (b) in both sections).  
     - This ensures that the harmed party can recover damages beyond the capped amounts if the other party’s misconduct falls into these categories.  

3. **Alignment with External Context**  
   - The external information (e.g., clauses about equitable remedies and irreparable harm) underscores that parties may seek injunctive relief or specific performance for breaches, but the carveouts here ensure that **monetary liability for egregious conduct (fraud, gross negligence, etc.) remains uncapped**.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- The clause explicitly **preserves liability** for intentional or reckless misconduct, ensuring that parties cannot hide behind liability caps in such cases.  
- It aligns with broader legal principles that **fraud and willful misconduct are not shielded by contractual limitations**, as reflected in the indemnification and damages provisions.  

### Practical Implications:  
- A party alleging fraud or gross negligence can bypass the liability cap and seek full damages.  
- The indemnification sections provide an additional avenue for recovery, ensuring that victims of misconduct are not limited by the general liability restrictions.  

In summary, the clause directly answers the query by **carving out fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from liability limitations**, ensuring accountability for egregious behavior.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Provisions Addressing the Query:
1. **Carveouts for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** both exclude claims arising from a party’s **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** from the general limitations on liability.  
     - This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the other party can seek **full remedies** (including consequential, indirect, or exemplary damages) that would otherwise be capped under the agreement.  
     - Example: If Party A commits fraud, Party B can sue for all actual damages (even lost profits) without being restricted by the liability cap in Section 11.7.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**  
   - **Sections 12.1 and 12.2** further reinforce this carveout by requiring indemnification for losses caused by a party’s **negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct**.  
     - These sections ensure that the harmed party is fully compensated for third-party claims or losses stemming from such misconduct, regardless of the liability cap.  

3. **Interaction with Liability Caps**  
   - The liability cap in Section 11.7 explicitly states that it **does not apply** to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (clause (a)(V)).  
   - This aligns with the broader legal principle that parties cannot contractually limit liability for intentional or egregious wrongdoing.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause **carves out fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** from both:  
  - The exclusion of consequential damages (Section 11.6).  
  - The aggregate liability cap (Section 11.7).  
- This ensures that a party engaging in such misconduct **cannot shield itself** from full liability.  
- The indemnification sections (12.1–12.2) provide additional recourse for third-party claims arising from misconduct.  

### Practical Implications:
- A party alleging fraud or gross negligence can bypass the agreement’s liability limitations and seek **full damages** (including consequential losses).  
- The indemnification provisions ensure that victims of misconduct are protected even in third-party claims.  

This structure is common in contracts to deter bad-faith behavior while still capping liability for ordinary breaches or negligence. The external references (e.g., irreparable harm and equitable remedies) further support that courts may enforce these carveouts strictly, as they reflect the parties’ intent to hold wrongdoers fully accountable.",5

ARTICLE 10","The **query** concerns a party's liability for **fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort** when subject to a **cap** (limitation). The provided **clause (9.5 Limitation of Liability)** directly addresses this issue by outlining the scope and exceptions to liability limitations. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **General Limitation of Liability**  
   - The clause broadly limits liability for damages arising from **contract, tort, negligence, breach of statutory duty, or otherwise**.  
   - It excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, special, punitive, or speculative damages** unless they are **probable and reasonably foreseeable**.

2. **Exceptions to the Limitation (Where Liability is NOT Capped)**  
   The clause explicitly **excludes** the following from the liability cap:  
   - **Fraud** (""in the event of the fraud of a party"")  
   - **Breach of specific obligations** (e.g., Intellectual Property or Confidentiality under Articles 7 & 10)  
   - **Third-party indemnified claims** (where damages must be paid to a third party under indemnification obligations)  

3. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - **Fraud**: Liability for fraud is **not capped**—meaning a fraudulent party can be held fully liable.  
   - **Negligence & Tort**: The clause **limits liability** for negligence, tort, or statutory breaches **unless** they fall under the exceptions (e.g., fraud or indemnifiable third-party claims).  
   - **Personal Injury**: While not explicitly mentioned, personal injury claims (if arising from negligence or tort) could be subject to the cap unless they involve fraud or indemnifiable third-party liabilities.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **partially caps liability** for negligence, tort, and statutory breaches but **excludes fraud and certain indemnified claims** from the cap. Thus, a party remains fully liable for **fraudulent acts** but may have limited exposure for **negligence or tort claims** unless an exception applies.

Here’s how:

1. **Scope of Liability Limitation**  
   - The clause broadly limits liability for damages arising from **tort (including negligence)**, breach of contract, or other legal theories.  
   - It explicitly excludes liability for **special, incidental, or consequential damages** unless covered under **Sections 13(a) and 13(b)** (which presumably carve out exceptions, possibly for fraud or willful misconduct).  

2. **Cap on Liability**  
   - The clause imposes a **financial cap** on liability, stating that damages (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) **cannot exceed the amounts paid by the Client to the other party under the agreement**.  
   - This means that even in cases of **negligence or tort-based claims (e.g., personal injury)**, the liable party’s exposure is strictly limited to the contractual payment amounts.  

3. **Exceptions (Fraud & Willful Misconduct?)**  
   - The clause does **not** explicitly mention **fraud** or intentional wrongdoing.  
   - If **Sections 13(a) and 13(b)** (referenced in the clause) cover fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, those claims may **not** be subject to the cap. Otherwise, courts might interpret the clause as **not limiting liability for fraud** (as fraud is often treated as non-excludable under law).  

4. **Relevance to External Information**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 10.12**) emphasize **equitable remedies (injunctions, specific performance)** for breaches but do not conflict with the liability cap.  
   - They suggest that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches, but the **Limitation of Liability** clause still controls the **financial exposure** for tort/negligence claims.  

### Key Takeaways:  
- The clause **caps liability** for negligence, tort, and contractual breaches but may **not** shield a party from fraud claims (unless Sections 13(a)/13(b) apply).  
- **Personal injury claims** (a subset of tort) would likely be subject to the cap unless excluded by law (e.g., statutory non-waivable liability).  
- Courts may scrutinize whether the cap applies to **gross negligence or intentional harm**, as such exclusions are often disfavored.

9 Limitation of Liability.
9.1 The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party and its affiliates in relation to this Agreement will be [***] (""""Liability Cap""""), provided however that:
9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause **""9. Limitation of Liability""** is directly relevant to the query regarding **a party's liability for fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort subject to a cap** in the following ways:

### **1. General Liability Cap (Section 9.1)**  
- The clause imposes a **maximum liability cap** (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the Agreement.  
- This cap applies broadly to liabilities in **contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute, or otherwise**, unless an exception applies.  

### **2. Exceptions to the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.1 & 9.1.2)**  
The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
- **Intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2)  
  - This means claims involving **fraud (intentional misrepresentation), willful wrongdoing, or reckless disregard for obligations** are **uncapped**.  
- **Material confidentiality breaches (Section 5)** and **indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)**  
  - These are carved out from the cap, meaning liability remains **unlimited** for these specific breaches.  

### **3. Relevance to the Query**  
- **Fraud**: Since fraud typically involves **intentional misconduct**, it would **not** be subject to the Liability Cap (Section 9.1.2).  
- **Negligence**:  
  - **Ordinary negligence** (not gross negligence) would generally be **capped** under Section 9.1.  
  - **Gross negligence** (a higher degree of negligence) would **not** be capped (Section 9.1.2).  
- **Personal Injury & Tort Claims**:  
  - If such claims arise from **ordinary negligence**, they would be subject to the cap.  
  - If they result from **gross negligence or intentional acts**, the cap would **not** apply.  

### **4. Interaction with External Information (Equitable Remedies)**  
The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5(c) and Section 10.12**) reinforce that:  
- **Equitable remedies (injunctions, specific performance)** remain available for breaches, even if monetary damages are capped.  
- The Liability Cap does **not** restrict non-monetary relief (e.g., court orders to stop misconduct).  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **limits liability for ordinary negligence and contractual breaches** but **excludes fraud, gross negligence, and certain contractual breaches (confidentiality, indemnification)** from the cap. Thus, a party’s liability for **fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury caused by intentional/willful acts** remains **uncapped**, while liability for **ordinary negligence or statutory torts** may be **limited**.

"a party's liability for fraud, negligence, personal injury or tort subject to a cap",6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The query concerns **a party's liability for fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort** and whether such liability is **subject to a cap**. The provided clause (**Section 13.4 Limitation of Liability**) is relevant in the following ways:

### 1. **Scope of Exclusions**  
The clause broadly limits liability for:  
- **Consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits, lost revenue).  
- Claims arising from **contract, tort, or product liability** (which would include negligence and certain torts).  

However, it **explicitly excludes** liability limitations for:  
- **Breaches of confidentiality (Section 11)** – meaning full liability remains for such breaches.  
- **Indemnification obligations** – suggesting indemnity claims (e.g., third-party claims) may not be capped.  

### 2. **Relevance to Fraud, Negligence, or Tort**  
- The clause applies to tort-based claims (e.g., negligence, product liability) but **does not explicitly mention fraud or personal injury**.  
- Under many jurisdictions, **fraudulent acts or intentional misconduct cannot be limited by contract**, so this clause may not shield a party from fraud liability.  
- **Personal injury claims** (a subset of torts) are often treated differently under law; if ""Applicable Law"" prohibits limiting such liability (as noted in the exception), the clause would not apply.  

### 3. **Cap on Damages?**  
- The clause **does not impose a monetary cap** (e.g., ""$X maximum liability"") but **excludes entire categories of damages** (e.g., consequential/punitive).  
- This functions as a **partial cap** by narrowing recoverable damages, though it does not limit **direct damages** (unless they fall under the excluded categories).  

### 4. **Exception for Applicable Law**  
The clause acknowledges that its limitations **do not apply if contrary to law**. For example:  
- **Fraud**: Many jurisdictions void liability waivers for fraud.  
- **Personal injury**: Statutory or common law may override contractual limits.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause **limits liability for negligence and some torts** by excluding certain damage types but likely **does not protect against fraud or personal injury** where law prohibits such limitations. It is **not a strict monetary cap** but a selective exclusion of damages.  

For a comprehensive answer, you would need to:  
1. Confirm whether **fraud/personal injury** is expressly carved out elsewhere in the agreement.  
2. Review the **indemnification section** (since indemnity obligations are preserved).  
3. Verify **governing law** to assess enforceability of the limitations.

### 1. **General Limitation of Liability (Cap)**  
   - Section 9.1 imposes a **Liability Cap** (a maximum monetary limit) on a party's liability to the other party and its affiliates under the Agreement.  
   - This cap applies broadly to liabilities arising from **contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute, or otherwise**, unless an exception applies.  

### 2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**  
   The Liability Cap **does not apply** to:  
   - **Intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2).  
     - This means claims involving **fraud (intentional misrepresentation or deceit) or gross negligence** are **uncapped**, exposing the liable party to full damages.  
   - **Material confidentiality breaches** (Section 5) and **indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1).  
     - These carve-outs ensure that certain high-risk breaches or specific contractual obligations remain fully enforceable.  

### 3. **Implications for the Query**  
   - **Fraud**: Falls under ""intentional misconduct,"" so liability is **uncapped**.  
   - **Negligence**:  
     - **Ordinary negligence**: Likely subject to the Liability Cap (since only ""gross negligence"" is exempt).  
     - **Gross negligence**: Uncapped under Section 9.1.2.  
   - **Personal injury or tort claims**:  
     - If arising from **intentional acts/gross negligence**, liability is uncapped.  
     - If arising from **ordinary negligence or strict liability**, the cap may apply unless another exception (e.g., indemnification) is triggered.  

### 4. **Interaction with External Information**  
   The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, but these are separate from monetary liability. The Liability Cap here governs **financial damages**, while equitable relief (e.g., specific performance) remains available regardless of the cap.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause **limits liability for ordinary negligence and statutory/tort claims** but **excludes fraud, gross negligence, and specific contractual breaches** from the cap. This balances risk allocation while ensuring accountability for egregious misconduct.

- **Indemnification obligations under Section 7.1**  
- **Material confidentiality breaches under Section 5**  

If **Section 7.1 (Indemnification)** includes obligations related to **personal or bodily injury** (e.g., indemnification for third-party injury claims), then such claims would **not** be subject to the Liability Cap. This means that:  
- **Unlimited liability** applies to indemnified claims, including bodily injury, if covered under Section 7.1.  
- The indemnification carveout effectively **overrides the Liability Cap** for such claims.  

### **2. Intentional Misconduct & Gross Negligence (Section 9.1.2)**  
The Liability Cap also **does not apply** to:  
- **Intentional misconduct**  
- **Gross negligence**  

If a **personal or bodily injury** arises from **gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing**, the Liability Cap would **not** protect the liable party.  

### **3. Definition of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**  
The broad definition of **""liability""** includes:  
- Claims, costs, damages, and losses **arising in tort (including negligence)**  
- **Statutory or equitable claims**  

This means that **personal injury claims** (typically tort-based) would generally fall under this definition. However, whether they are **capped** depends on whether they are:  
- Covered under **indemnification (Section 7.1, uncapped)**  
- Result from **gross negligence/intentional acts (uncapped)**  
- Otherwise subject to the **Liability Cap (if not exempted)**  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **does not explicitly mention ""personal or bodily injury""** but provides two key exceptions to the Liability Cap that could apply:  
1. **Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1)** – If personal injury claims are indemnifiable, they are **uncapped**.  
2. **Gross negligence/intentional misconduct** – If injury results from such conduct, liability is **uncapped**.  

If **Section 7.1** includes indemnification for third-party bodily injury claims, then such claims would **not** be limited by the Liability Cap. Otherwise, unless gross negligence/intentional misconduct is involved, bodily injury claims might still be **subject to the cap**.  

For a definitive answer, **Section 7.1 (Indemnification)** should be reviewed to confirm whether it covers personal/bodily injury.

### 1. **General Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - The clause imposes a **monetary cap** on liability for all claims, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or under indemnification provisions.  
   - This means that, absent exceptions, a party's total liability (even for indemnifiable claims) is limited to a specified dollar amount.  

### 2. **Indemnification Carveout (Section 12.3)**  
   - While **consequential, indirect, and special damages** are generally excluded (Section 12.3), the clause explicitly **preserves indemnification obligations** for **""Indemnifiable Loss.""**  
   - If **personal or bodily injury** qualifies as an **""Indemnifiable Loss""** under the agreement (e.g., under a separate indemnity clause), then the **cap in Section 12.4 would not apply** to such claims.  
   - This creates an **exception to the liability cap** for indemnifiable claims, which could include bodily injury if the indemnification clause covers it.  

### 3. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - The query asks whether **personal/bodily injury** is exempt from the liability cap. The answer depends on:  
     1. Whether the agreement defines **""Indemnifiable Loss""** to include bodily injury (common in indemnity clauses for third-party claims).  
     2. Whether the indemnification provision (e.g., elsewhere in **Section 12**) explicitly carves out liability for bodily injury.  
   - If so, **Section 12.3** ensures that indemnification claims (including for bodily injury) are **not subject to the general exclusion of consequential damages**, and **Section 12.4’s cap would not apply** to such indemnified losses.  

### 4. **External Context (Specific Performance Clauses)**  
   - The external excerpts (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 9.10**) emphasize that equitable remedies (like injunctions) are preserved despite liability limitations.  
   - However, they do not directly address bodily injury exceptions. Instead, they reinforce that **monetary caps (like Section 12.4) do not restrict non-monetary remedies**.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause **limits overall liability** but **carves out indemnifiable losses** from that cap. If personal/bodily injury falls under **""Indemnifiable Loss,""** the cap **does not apply** to those claims. To confirm, you would need to review:  
   - The definition of **""Indemnifiable Loss""** in the agreement.  
   - Any **specific indemnification provisions** addressing bodily injury.

12.4 Limitation on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided (**Sections 12.3 and 12.4**) is relevant to the query about a **""personal or bodily injury exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout""** in the following ways:

### 1. **General Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**
   - The clause imposes a **monetary cap** on liability for ""any and all causes whatsoever,"" including claims arising from contract, tort (e.g., negligence), or indemnification. This means that, in most cases, a party's liability is limited to a specified dollar amount (redacted as `$[* * *]`).

### 2. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages (Section 12.3)**
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits), unless the claim falls under **indemnifiable losses**.  
   - This suggests that **direct damages** (such as those arising from personal or bodily injury) may still be recoverable, especially if tied to indemnification obligations.

### 3. **Indemnification Carveout (Section 12.3 Exception)**
   - The clause states that the limitation on liability **does not apply** to indemnification obligations (""any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss"").  
   - If **personal or bodily injury** is defined as an ""Indemnifiable Loss"" elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., under indemnification provisions), such claims could **bypass the liability cap** entirely.  
   - This creates a **carveout** where indemnifiable claims (including bodily injury) are not subject to the general limitation on liability.

### 4. **Relevance to the Query**
   - The query asks whether personal/bodily injury is **excepted from the liability cap** via an indemnification carveout.  
   - Here, the clause **supports such an exception**:  
     - Indemnifiable claims (potentially including bodily injury) are **exempt from the cap** (Section 12.3).  
     - The general cap (Section 12.4) applies to all other claims, but indemnification obligations (if triggered) override it.  

### 5. **Connection to External Information**
   - The external excerpts (e.g., **specific performance** clauses) emphasize that certain breaches (like failing to indemnify) may justify **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions).  
   - While not directly addressing bodily injury, they reinforce that **indemnification obligations are treated as critical**, potentially aligning with the carveout logic in Sections 12.3–12.4.

### Key Takeaway  
The clause **allows for unlimited liability for indemnifiable claims** (which could include bodily injury if so defined), while capping all other liabilities. To confirm, you’d need to review:  
1. The definition of **""Indemnifiable Loss""** (to see if bodily injury is included).  
2. Any **specific exclusions to the liability cap** (e.g., for gross negligence or intentional harm).

### 1. **Liability Cap and Exceptions (Section 9.1)**  
   - The clause imposes a general cap on liability (""Liability Cap"") for claims arising under the Agreement.  
   - However, **Section 9.1.1** carves out exceptions where the Liability Cap **does not apply**, including:  
     - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).  
     - **Indemnification obligations under Section 7.1** (which may include liabilities for personal/bodily injury if covered by the indemnity clause).  

### 2. **Indemnification Carveout (Section 9.1.1)**  
   - If **Section 7.1** (Indemnification) includes obligations for personal/bodily injury (e.g., third-party claims for harm caused by a party’s actions), such liabilities would **not be subject to the Liability Cap**.  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on an **indemnification carveout** for bodily injury, ensuring such claims are fully covered regardless of the general cap.  

### 3. **Intentional Misconduct/Gross Negligence (Section 9.1.2)**  
   - The Liability Cap also **does not apply** to intentional misconduct or gross negligence, which could include reckless or deliberate acts causing bodily harm.  

### 4. **Scope of ""Liability"" (Section 9.2)**  
   - The definition of ""liability"" explicitly includes **tort claims** (e.g., negligence) and statutory liabilities, which are typical bases for personal/bodily injury claims.  
   - If indemnification under **Section 7.1** covers such tort claims, they would bypass the cap.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause supports the query by:  
- Exempting indemnification obligations (potentially covering bodily injury) from the Liability Cap.  
- Explicitly excluding tort-based liabilities (like negligence) from the cap, which often arise in injury cases.  
- Reinforcing that intentional/grossly negligent acts causing injury are uncapped.  

For a definitive answer, **Section 7.1** (Indemnification) would need to be reviewed to confirm whether it expressly covers personal/bodily injury. If it does, such claims would **not** be limited by the Liability Cap.

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses.

### **1. Indemnification Scope and Carveouts**  
The clause broadly requires the franchisee (""You"") to indemnify the franchisor and related parties (""Indemnitees"") for **""any and all losses and expenses""** arising from the franchisee's operations, including claims related to vehicle maintenance/operation (which often involve personal/bodily injury risks). However, it includes a **carveout** for liability arising from the **gross negligence of the Indemnitees** (unless joint liability applies).  

- **Relevance to Query**:  
  - If there is a **cap on liability** elsewhere in the agreement, this indemnification clause could **override that cap** for claims covered here (e.g., bodily injury claims from vehicle accidents).  
  - The **gross negligence exception** acts as a **carveout**, meaning indemnification would not apply if the Indemnitees' gross negligence caused the injury.  

### **2. Personal/Bodily Injury Implications**  
The clause explicitly covers:  
- **Compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages** (common in injury cases).  
- **Fines, penalties, and legal fees** (often incurred in injury litigation).  
- **Claims from vehicle operation** (a frequent source of bodily injury liability).  

- **Relevance to Query**:  
  - Since bodily injury claims are typically high-value, this indemnification clause effectively **shifts liability** for such claims to the franchisee, even if there is a general liability cap elsewhere.  
  - The **exception for gross negligence** ensures that the franchisor is not indemnified if its own severe misconduct caused the injury.  

### **3. Defense and Settlement Control**  
The franchisor can **assume defense/settlement** of claims at the franchisee’s expense, which is critical in injury cases where early settlement or strategic litigation can limit exposure.  

- **Relevance to Query**:  
  - If the agreement has a **liability cap**, this clause may allow the franchisor to **bypass it** by forcing the franchisee to cover injury-related costs.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause **expands liability exposure** for the franchisee, particularly for personal/bodily injury claims (e.g., from vehicle accidents), despite any general liability cap. The **gross negligence carveout** is the key exception, preventing indemnification if the franchisor’s severe misconduct caused the harm.  

If the query seeks to **limit liability for bodily injury**, this clause would need to be **narrowed further** (e.g., adding an explicit exclusion for bodily injury or capping indemnification amounts). Conversely, if the goal is to **ensure indemnification covers such claims**, this clause already does so broadly.

Here’s how:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Carveout for IP Infringement Liability (Section 9.3)**  
   - The clause explicitly **excludes liability arising from Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)** from the general limitations on liability.  
   - This means that claims related to **third-party IP infringement (e.g., indemnification for IP claims)** are **not subject to the cap on damages** or the exclusion of indirect/consequential damages.  
   - The carveout ensures that the indemnifying party remains **fully liable** for IP-related claims, even if other liabilities are capped.

2. **General Cap on Liability**  
   - For all other claims (non-IP-related), liability is **capped** at the amount earned by the party under **Section 5.4 (Revenue Sharing)** in the preceding 12 months.  
   - However, this cap **does not apply** to IP infringement claims under Section 9.3, meaning the liable party could be exposed to **uncapped damages** for such claims.

3. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, goodwill).  
   - But again, this exclusion **does not apply** to IP infringement claims under Section 9.3, meaning such damages **may still be recoverable** in an IP indemnification scenario.

### Connection to the Query:
- The query asks about an **exception to the liability cap for third-party IP infringement via an indemnification carveout**.  
- This clause **explicitly creates that exception** by excluding Section 9.3 (IP Infringement) from both:  
  - The **monetary cap** on liability, and  
  - The **bar on indirect/consequential damages**.  
- Thus, a party seeking indemnification for third-party IP claims could **recover uncapped damages**, including potentially broader categories of losses (e.g., lost profits), unlike other types of claims under the agreement.

### Additional Context from External Information:
- The referenced **specific performance clauses** (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10) reinforce that certain breaches (like IP-related ones) may justify **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions)** beyond monetary damages, further underscoring the significance of the IP indemnification carveout.

### Conclusion:
This clause **prioritizes IP infringement claims** by ensuring they are not constrained by the agreement’s general liability limitations, aligning with the query’s focus on an **indemnification carveout for third-party IP risks**.",5

12.2 Except with regard to a breach of confidentiality, a party's indemnification obligations hereunder, or infringement of intellectual property rights, either party's total liability to the other party under this Agreement shall be limited to the amounts paid or payable by the Reseller to Todos during the twelve-month period preceding the interposition of the claim.","The **query** asks about a **third-party IP infringement exception to the cap on liability via an indemnification carveout**. The provided **clause** (Section 12, ""Limitation of Liability"") is directly relevant to this query because it:  

1. **Imposes a General Cap on Liability** (Section 12.2):  
   - The clause limits a party’s total liability to the amounts paid/payable by the Reseller to Todos in the 12 months preceding the claim.  
   - This is the **default cap on liability** for most claims under the agreement.  

2. **Carves Out Exceptions to the Cap** (Section 12.2):  
   The cap **does not apply** to three categories:  
   - **Breach of confidentiality**  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (e.g., third-party claims covered by indemnity)  
   - **Infringement of intellectual property rights** (IPR)  

   This means that for **third-party IP infringement claims** (e.g., if a third party sues one party for IP infringement due to the other party’s actions), the liable party’s exposure is **not limited** by the cap in Section 12.2. Instead, the indemnification obligations (if any) or full liability for IP infringement would apply.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause explicitly **excludes IP infringement from the liability cap**, aligning with the query’s focus on an exception for third-party IP claims.  
- If the agreement includes an **indemnification clause** (not provided here), the carveout ensures that indemnity for third-party IP claims would **not be subject to the cap**, allowing full recovery.  
- The external information (though focused on injunctive relief) underscores that IP breaches are often treated as **irreparable harm**, justifying uncapped liability or equitable remedies.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **answers the query** by confirming that third-party IP infringement claims are **exempt from the liability cap**, preserving the aggrieved party’s right to seek full damages or indemnification. This is a common drafting approach to protect against uncapped risks like IP disputes.

third party IP infringement exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout,5da8e756e1,"9.3. Limitation of Liability.

### Analysis of the Clause:  
The **Limitation of Liability** clause (Section 9.3) generally restricts liability for **special, indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages**, but it includes **key exceptions** where liability is **not capped**:  
1. **Breach of Article 7 or Section 8.1.5** (representations and warranties).  
2. **Indemnification obligations** under:  
   - **Section 9.4(i)(d)** (Impresse’s indemnification obligations)  
   - **Section 9.5(i)(d)** (VerticalNet’s indemnification obligations)  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- If **third-party IP infringement claims** are covered under either **Article 7, Section 8.1.5(v), or the indemnification sections (9.4(i)(d) or 9.5(i)(d))**, then the **liability cap does not apply**—meaning the responsible party could be liable for **full damages** (including special, indirect, or consequential damages).  
- If the IP infringement claim **does not fall under these exceptions**, then the **liability cap remains in effect**, shielding the parties from uncapped exposure.  

### Key Considerations:  
- **Check the indemnification sections (9.4(i)(d) & 9.5(i)(d))**: If they explicitly cover third-party IP claims, then liability is uncapped.  
- **Review Article 7 & Section 8.1.5(v)**: If IP-related warranties or covenants are included, a breach could trigger uncapped liability.  
- **External context (specific performance clauses)**: While not directly relevant, they reinforce that certain breaches (like IP misrepresentations) may justify equitable relief beyond monetary caps.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause is **highly relevant** because it determines whether third-party IP infringement claims **bypass the liability cap** via indemnification or warranty breaches. If the claim fits within the carveouts, the cap does not apply. Otherwise, liability remains limited.

third party IP infringement exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout,6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability.

Here's how the clause (Section 13.4) is relevant:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Limitation of Liability**:  
   - The clause broadly limits liability for certain types of damages (e.g., consequential, indirect, punitive) **except** for:
     - Breaches of confidentiality (Section 11).
     - Indemnification obligations (explicitly carved out from the limitation).
     - Damages awarded to a third party under a **Third Party Claim** (e.g., IP infringement claims).

2. **Third-Party Claims Exception**:  
   - The clause states that the liability cap **does not apply** to damages awarded to a third party (e.g., a patent holder suing for IP infringement).  
   - This means if a third party successfully claims IP infringement against a party to the contract, and that party seeks indemnification from the other contracting party, the **limitation on liability would not shield the indemnifying party** from covering those third-party damages.

3. **Indemnification Carveout**:  
   - The phrase *""without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder""* confirms that indemnification obligations (which often cover third-party IP claims) are **unaffected by the liability cap**.  
   - Thus, if the contract includes an indemnity for third-party IP infringement, the indemnifying party’s liability for such claims would **not be capped** by Section 13.4.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause explicitly **preserves liability for third-party claims**, meaning IP infringement damages awarded to a third party would **fall outside the liability cap**.  
- The indemnification carveout ensures that if the contract requires one party to indemnify the other for third-party IP claims, that obligation **trumps the general limitation of liability**.  

### Supporting Context:
The external excerpts (Sections 11.13 and 8.5(c)) emphasize that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are available for breaches, but they do not directly address liability caps. However, they reinforce that certain obligations (like specific performance) are treated as critical—similar to how indemnification for third-party claims is treated as a **material exception** to liability limits.

### Conclusion:
The clause answers the query by confirming that **third-party IP infringement claims are exempt from the liability cap**, especially where indemnification applies. The indemnification carveout ensures such claims remain fully actionable.",5

Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The clause is directly relevant to the query regarding a **third-party IP infringement exception to the cap on liability via an indemnification carveout**. Here’s how:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Liability Cap (Section 11.3)**  
   - The agreement imposes a **monetary cap** on liability for breaches, limiting it to the aggregate purchase prices paid in the **12 months preceding a claim**.  
   - This cap applies to most breaches but includes **exceptions** where the cap does *not* apply.  

2. **Exception for Unauthorized Use of Intellectual Property (IP)**  
   - Both Sections 10 and 11.3 explicitly **exclude liability arising from breaches associated with unauthorized use of IP** from the cap.  
   - This means:  
     - If a party is liable for **third-party IP infringement** (e.g., distributing products that infringe a patent or copyright), the **liability cap does not apply**.  
     - The injured party can seek **full damages** (including consequential, punitive, or special damages) for such breaches, as Section 10 also excludes these damages from limitations.  

3. **Indemnification Carveout**  
   - The exception acts as a **carveout to the liability cap**, preserving the right to claim uncapped damages for IP-related breaches.  
   - This aligns with typical indemnification clauses where IP infringement claims are treated as **high-risk exposures** warranting uncapped liability.  

4. **Link to Equitable Remedies (External Context)**  
   - The external references (e.g., *Maud_102* and *Maud_417*) highlight that parties retain rights to **injunctive relief** for breaches, including IP breaches.  
   - Even though the clause limits monetary liability for most claims, **IP breaches** are treated distinctly, allowing for **specific performance or injunctions** (e.g., to stop unauthorized IP use) alongside uncapped damages.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause explicitly **carves out third-party IP infringement claims from the liability cap**, ensuring that:  
- The indemnifying party remains **fully liable** for IP-related damages.  
- The injured party can pursue **all remedies** (monetary and equitable) without being constrained by the general cap.  

This reflects a common contractual approach to **IP risk allocation**, where parties avoid capping liability for high-stakes IP violations while limiting exposure for other breaches.  

**Key Takeaway:** The exception for unauthorized IP use ensures that IP infringement claims are **not subject to the liability cap**, preserving full indemnification rights for such breaches.",5

Here's how:

### **1. Carveouts for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
Both **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** contain exceptions where the general limitations on liability **do not apply**, including:  
- **Fraud**  
- **Gross negligence**  
- **Willful misconduct**  

This means that if a party engages in any of these wrongful acts, they **cannot rely on the liability cap** (e.g., the ""[***]"" monetary limit in Section 11.7) and may be exposed to **full damages**, including consequential, indirect, or other excluded damages under Section 11.6.

### **2. Indemnification Obligations Reinforce the Exception**  
- **Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance)** explicitly requires each party to indemnify the other for losses arising from **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (Sections 12.1(b) and 12.2(b)).  
- This indemnification obligation is **also carved out from the liability cap** (Section 11.7(A)(V)-(VI)), meaning that claims related to these acts are **not subject to the [***] limit**.  

### **3. Interaction with Equitable Remedies (External Context)**  
The **external information** (e.g., MAUD clauses) reinforces that:  
- **Equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance)** are available for breaches, particularly where monetary damages are inadequate.  
- Since fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct often involve **intentional harm or bad faith**, courts may be more inclined to grant **injunctive relief** or **full damages** despite contractual liability caps.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **clearly carves out fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** from both:  
- The **exclusion of consequential damages** (Section 11.6)  
- The **general liability cap** (Section 11.7)  
- And subjects such conduct to **full indemnification** (Article 12).  

This ensures that a party engaging in such misconduct **cannot hide behind contractual liability limitations** and remains fully accountable. The external context further supports that **equitable remedies** (like injunctions) may also apply in such cases.

Here’s a breakdown of the relevance:

### 1. **Carveouts for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** both exclude liability caps for damages arising from:  
     - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsections (E) in 11.6 and (V) in 11.7).  
     - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (subsections (F) in 11.6 and (VI) in 11.7).  
   - This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the standard limitations on liability (e.g., no consequential damages, aggregate liability caps) **do not apply**. The injured party can seek full remedies, including direct, indirect, and consequential damages.

### 2. **Indemnification Obligations (Article 12)**  
   - **Sections 12.1 and 12.2** explicitly require each party (BLI and Ginkgo) to indemnify the other for Claims and Losses arising from:  
     - Breach of the agreement or inaccurate representations/warranties.  
     - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (subsections (b) in both 12.1 and 12.2).  
   - These indemnification obligations are **carved out from the liability limits** in Sections 11.6 and 11.7, meaning they are not subject to the cap on aggregate liability or the exclusion of consequential damages.

### 3. **Key Implications for the Query**  
   - The clauses ensure that **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct cannot be shielded** by contractual liability limitations.  
   - Indemnification for such conduct is **unlimited** (i.e., not capped by the ""[***]"" aggregate liability limit in 11.7).  
   - The carveouts align with common legal principles that prohibit parties from contractually limiting liability for intentional or egregious wrongdoing.  

### 4. **Connection to External Information**  
   - While the external excerpts focus on equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, the clause here complements those provisions by ensuring that **monetary remedies** (via indemnification and uncapped liability) are available for fraud or willful misconduct.  
   - The agreement thus provides **both equitable and monetary protections** for severe misconduct, reinforcing the parties' rights to full redress.  

### Summary  
The clause directly answers the query by:  
1) Explicitly excluding fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from liability caps, and  
2) Requiring full indemnification for such conduct, overriding any general limitations on damages or liability. This ensures accountability for egregious acts while preserving standard limitations for ordinary breaches.",5

### 1. **Carveout for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - Both **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** explicitly exclude **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** from the general limitations on liability.  
   - This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they **cannot rely on the liability cap** or the exclusion of consequential damages.  
   - The carveout ensures that a party acting in bad faith or with extreme recklessness remains fully liable for all resulting damages.

### 2. **Indemnification Exception**  
   - The clause also carves out **indemnification obligations under Article 12** from the liability cap.  
   - This means that indemnification claims (e.g., third-party claims covered under the agreement) are **not subject to the general liability limit**, ensuring that the indemnifying party remains fully responsible for such claims.  
   - If fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct is involved in an indemnifiable claim, the indemnifying party cannot limit its exposure.

### 3. **Interaction with Equitable Remedies (External Context)**  
   - The external references (e.g., **Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction**) highlight that parties may seek **injunctive relief or specific performance** for breaches, particularly where monetary damages are inadequate.  
   - Since fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct often involve intentional harm or egregious conduct, courts may be more inclined to grant **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) in addition to uncapped damages.  

### **Summary of Relevance to Query**  
The clause confirms that:  
1. **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are **exceptions to liability caps**, meaning full damages (including consequential damages) can be claimed.  
2. **Indemnification obligations** are also **excluded from liability limits**, ensuring broader protection for harmed parties.  
3. The external context suggests that **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) may be available alongside uncapped damages in cases of misconduct.  

This structure ensures that parties cannot shield themselves from liability for intentional or reckless wrongdoing while still maintaining reasonable limitations for ordinary breaches.",5

### 1. **Carveout for Gross Negligence/Intentional Misconduct**  
   - **Section 9.1.2** explicitly states that the Liability Cap **does not apply** to liabilities arising from **""intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.""**  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on exceptions to liability caps for **fraud (intentional misconduct) and gross negligence**. These are common carveouts in contracts to ensure that a party cannot evade accountability for egregious wrongdoing or reckless behavior.  

### 2. **Indemnification Carveout**  
   - **Section 9.1.1** carves out indemnification obligations (under Section 7.1) from the Liability Cap.  
   - If the indemnification clause (Section 7.1) covers claims related to **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**, this carveout ensures such liabilities are **uncapped**. This is critical because indemnification often addresses third-party claims where the stakes (e.g., legal judgments) can far exceed typical contractual damages.  

### 3. **Scope of Liability Definition**  
   - **Section 9.2** broadly defines ""liability"" to include **all claims, costs, and damages** (contract, tort, statute, etc.).  
   - This reinforces that the carveouts in **9.1.1–9.1.2** apply to **any legal theory** (e.g., tort claims for fraud or negligence), not just contractual breaches.  

### 4. **Link to External Context**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., *Section 8.5(c)* and *Section 10.12*) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, but they also acknowledge that monetary caps may not suffice for **irreparable harm** or **bad-faith conduct**.  
   - The Liability Cap carveouts in your clause align with this principle: **intentional/grossly negligent acts** are treated as uncapped because they inherently involve higher culpability and potential for severe harm.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause explicitly **excludes fraud (intentional misconduct) and gross negligence** from liability limits, ensuring parties remain fully liable for egregious acts. It also **carves out indemnification**, which may cover third-party claims arising from such conduct. This dual protection addresses both **direct contractual breaches** and **indemnifiable third-party risks**.

"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout",0eabff6ea5,"14.4 Indemnification You shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent by law us, our affiliates and our respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, and agents, (collectively the ""Indemnitees"") from any and all losses and expenses (as hereinafter defined) incurred in connection with any litigation or other form of adjudicatory procedure, claim, demand, investigation, or formal or informal inquiry (regardless of whether same is reduced to judgment) or any settlement thereof which arises directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business including, but not limited to, claims arising as a result of the maintenance and operation of vehicles (collectively an ""event""), and regardless of whether same resulted from any strict or vicarious liability imposed by law on the Indemnitees; provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any liability arising from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees (except to the extent that joint liability is involved, in which event the indemnification provided herein shall extend to any finding of comparative negligence or contributory negligence attributable to you). For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel. Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause you provided (Section 14.4 Indemnification) is highly relevant to the query about **""fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout""** for the following reasons:

### **1. Indemnification Carveout for Gross Negligence**  
The clause explicitly states that the indemnification obligation **does not apply** to liabilities arising from the **gross negligence of the Indemnitees** (the franchisor and its affiliates). This means:  
- The indemnitor (the franchisee) is not required to indemnify the franchisor if the franchisor’s own **gross negligence** caused the liability.  
- However, if there is **joint or comparative negligence** (where both parties share fault), the indemnification still applies to the franchisee’s portion of liability.  

This aligns with the query by showing how **gross negligence** is treated as an exception to the indemnification obligation.  

### **2. No Explicit Mention of Fraud or Willful Misconduct**  
While the clause carves out **gross negligence**, it does **not** explicitly exclude **fraud** or **willful misconduct** from the indemnification obligation. This could mean:  
- If fraud or willful misconduct by the Indemnitees occurs, the indemnification might still apply (unless another clause in the agreement limits this).  
- Courts may interpret the omission differently—some may imply that fraud/willful misconduct is excluded (as it is worse than gross negligence), while others may enforce indemnification strictly.  

### **3. Broad Scope of Indemnification (But Subject to Exceptions)**  
The indemnification covers a wide range of claims (including strict liability, vicarious liability, and punitive damages), but the **gross negligence carveout** acts as a **limitation** on this broad protection.  

### **4. Relevance to Liability Caps**  
If the agreement has a **cap on liability**, this indemnification clause interacts with it by:  
- Potentially **preserving unlimited liability** for gross negligence (since indemnification doesn’t apply).  
- Leaving open whether fraud/willful misconduct would also be excluded from liability caps (since they are not explicitly mentioned).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is directly relevant to the query because:  
✔ It **carves out gross negligence** from indemnification, meaning the indemnitor (franchisee) is not liable for the franchisor’s gross negligence.  
❌ It does **not explicitly address fraud or willful misconduct**, leaving uncertainty on whether they are also excluded.  
⚖ If the agreement has a **liability cap**, this carveout ensures that gross negligence (and possibly fraud/willful misconduct, by extension) remains **uncapped**.  

For a complete answer, you would need to check if:  
- Another clause in the agreement explicitly excludes **fraud/willful misconduct** from indemnification.  
- There is a **separate liability cap provision** that interacts with this indemnification clause.

Liability Cap**) is a **seller-favorable limitation of liability provision**, which directly addresses your query about ""seller-favorable cap on liability clauses."" Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **General Cap on Liability**:  
   - The clause limits the total liability of either party (but particularly protects the seller, Accuray) to the aggregate purchase prices paid by the Distributor for Products in the **12 months preceding a claim**.  
   - This cap shields the seller from excessive or unpredictable liability, ensuring their exposure is tied to a measurable, finite amount (revenue from the prior year).

2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Carve-Outs)**:  
   While the cap is broad, it excludes:  
   - **IP breaches (unauthorized use of Intellectual Property)** – Seller retains full liability for IP misuse.  
   - **Intentional breaches/willful misconduct** – Prevents parties from evading liability for bad-faith actions.  
   - **Violations of mandatory laws/regulations** – Ensures compliance with legal standards.  
   These carve-outs balance the cap by preserving liability for egregious or unlawful conduct, but the seller still benefits from the cap for ordinary breaches.

3. **Temporal Limitation (12-Month Lookback)**:  
   - Liability is calculated based on a **rolling 12-month period**, preventing cumulative claims from exceeding a manageable threshold tied to recent transactions.  
   - This further favors the seller by avoiding open-ended exposure (e.g., claims spanning the entire contract term).

4. **Comparison to External Context**:  
   The external examples (from Section 10.3) deal with termination fees tied to acquisition proposals, but your clause focuses on **limiting post-breach liability**. Both are seller-protective but operate in different contexts:  
   - **Section 10.3**: Protects the seller (or parent company) in M&A scenarios by imposing fees if the buyer pursues alternative deals.  
   - **Section 11.3**: Protects the seller (Accuray) in commercial transactions by capping liability for contractual breaches.  

### Why This is Seller-Favorable:
- **Predictability**: The seller can forecast maximum liability exposure based on sales volume.  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Ordinary breaches (e.g., delivery delays, minor non-performance) won’t expose the seller to catastrophic losses.  
- **Negotiation Leverage**: The distributor (buyer) assumes more risk for non-excluded claims, as their recourse is limited.  

### Practical Implications:
- A buyer might push to **expand carve-outs** (e.g., include gross negligence) or **increase the cap** (e.g., 24 months of purchases).  
- The seller would resist such changes to maintain the favorable structure.  

In summary, this clause is a **classic seller-favorable liability cap**, balancing limited exposure with reasonable exceptions to deter misconduct. It contrasts with the M&A-focused protections in the external examples but serves a similar goal: shielding the seller from disproportionate liability.",5
seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,f52cb3b7ad,"IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER’S OR SELLER’S LIABILITY, ONE TO THE OTHER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE RESPECTIVE OTHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD 13 MILLION; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BAD FAITH, INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The provided clause is a **seller-favorable cap on liability** because it limits the maximum financial exposure of both the buyer and the seller to **USD 13 million** for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, or other obligations under the agreement. This is advantageous to the seller (and buyer, symmetrically) because it provides certainty and reduces the risk of unlimited liability in case of contractual breaches.

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Monetary Cap** – The clause explicitly caps liability at **USD 13 million**, protecting the seller from excessive claims beyond this amount.  
2. **Exceptions to the Cap** – While the cap applies broadly, it **does not** limit liability for:  
   - **Bad faith, intentional, or willful misconduct** (preventing parties from evading liability for deliberate wrongdoing).  
   - **Third-party claims for personal injury or property damage** (ensuring accountability for severe consequences of breaches).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The query seeks **seller-favorable liability limitations**, and this clause fits that description by:  
- **Shielding the seller** from open-ended financial risk.  
- **Balancing protection** with carve-outs for egregious conduct (e.g., fraud) and third-party harm, which are common in well-drafted agreements.  

### Connection to External Information:  
The external clauses (M&A-specific) emphasize **specific performance and injunctive relief** as remedies for breaches, but they do not address monetary caps. The provided liability clause complements such provisions by:  
- **Limiting monetary exposure** while preserving equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions).  
- **Aligning with the principle** that certain breaches (like willful misconduct) should not be shielded by caps.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is **seller-favorable** because it imposes a clear, negotiated limit on liability while maintaining accountability for intentional misconduct or severe third-party harm. It provides predictability in risk allocation, which is a key concern for sellers in transactions.  

Would you like any refinements or additional analysis on enforceability or negotiation tactics for such clauses?",5
seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,ff35aa7411,"9. Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties waive and relinquish any claims, demands, causes of action or recoveries for punitive damages, exemplary damages, or statutory damages. Seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the sale of the products, including any lost revenues or profits, consequential and/or incidental damages, business interruption or damage to business reputation, regardless of the theory upon which any claim may be based, including any statutory causes of action or claims. In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","The provided **""Limitation of Liability"" clause** is a **seller-favorable cap on liability** because it significantly restricts the buyer's ability to recover damages from the seller, particularly in ways that favor the seller's financial and legal exposure. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Seller-Favorable Elements:
1. **Waiver of Certain Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly waives claims for **punitive, exemplary, or statutory damages**, which are often sought in disputes to penalize wrongful conduct or compensate beyond actual losses. This shields the seller from high-risk liabilities.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**:  
   - The seller is not liable for **indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption). These are typically the most significant claims in commercial disputes, so excluding them heavily favors the seller.

3. **Monetary Cap on Liability**:  
   - The seller’s total liability is capped at **the purchase price paid for the products** (or the defective portion). This is a strict financial limit, ensuring the seller’s exposure never exceeds the transaction value, even if the buyer’s actual losses are far greater.

4. **""Essential Purpose"" Caveat**:  
   - The clause anticipates scenarios where contractual remedies (e.g., replacement/repair) might fail, but still limits liability to the purchase price. This prevents buyers from arguing for uncapped damages under breach-of-warranty theories.

### Relevance to External Context:  
The external excerpts (e.g., *Section 9.10* and *Section 8.5(c)*) emphasize **specific performance** as a remedy for breaches, but they also note that equitable relief is subject to other limitations (e.g., *Section 8.3(d)* or *Section 7.4*). The **Limitation of Liability** clause here operates similarly by overriding default legal remedies (e.g., full compensation for damages) with a **contractually agreed cap**, which is a hallmark of seller-favorable drafting.

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:  
- **Risk Allocation**: The seller transfers nearly all financial risk of performance failures to the buyer.  
- **Predictability**: The seller’s maximum liability is fixed and calculable.  
- **Deterrence**: The clause discourages buyers from pursuing costly litigation by limiting recoverable amounts.  

This type of clause is common in sales agreements where sellers seek to minimize exposure while retaining the ability to enforce specific performance (as referenced in the external texts).",5
seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause **""11.4 Limitation of Liability""** is highly relevant to the query regarding **""seller-favorable cap on liability clauses""** because it imposes a strict financial limit (AUD 50,000) on the liability of both parties (Fiserv and the Merchant) for losses arising from breaches or other claims under the agreement. Here’s why this is seller-favorable:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Low Liability Cap (AUD 50,000)**  
   - The cap significantly restricts the maximum exposure of Fiserv (the seller/service provider) for most claims, protecting it from large financial risks. This is advantageous to the seller, as it shifts the risk of higher losses to the Merchant (the buyer/client).

2. **Narrow Exceptions to the Cap**  
   - The clause carves out only two exceptions where the cap does not apply:  
     - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds (a core function it cannot avoid).  
     - The Merchant’s payment obligations (ensuring the seller still gets paid).  
   - By excluding other common liabilities (e.g., fraud, negligence, or third-party claims), the seller further limits its exposure.

3. **Broad Scope of Covered Claims**  
   - The cap applies to losses ""arising from any cause"" and under ""any legal theory,"" which is expansive and shields the seller from diverse claims (e.g., breach of contract, tort, or statutory violations).

4. **Asymmetry in Protection**  
   - While the clause nominally applies to both parties, the exceptions primarily safeguard the seller’s revenue streams (e.g., ensuring payment for services) while leaving the Merchant with limited recourse for other damages.

### Comparison to External Information:  
The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** from MAUD_102) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, but they do not cap monetary liability. In contrast, **Clause 11.4** explicitly limits financial liability, which is more favorable to the seller. The **Termination Fee** provision (MAUD_176) also shows how parties may negotiate specific financial consequences for breaches, but it doesn’t impose a blanket liability cap like Clause 11.4.

### Conclusion:  
This clause is **seller-favorable** because it:  
- Imposes a low, fixed liability cap.  
- Minimizes exceptions (favoring the seller’s financial interests).  
- Covers all potential causes of action, reducing litigation risk for the seller.  

For the Merchant, this creates a significant disadvantage, as its ability to recover substantial damages is severely restricted.",5
seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,42517c5ee6,"LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTY AND LIABILITY:
(d) Seller’s maximum liability for all claims for any reason is the invoice price of the Product(s) involved. Neither Party will be liable to the other Party in contract, tort, negligence, breach of statutory laws, or otherwise for any losses, damages, costs, or expenses of any nature whatsoever that may be incurred or suffered by or in any event could otherwise be awarded to that other Party which are of a special, incidental, punitive, consequential, indirect, or exemplary nature, including, without limitation, any economic loss or other loss of turnover, profits, business, or goodwill.
(e) The remedies set forth in this Section 7 are exclusive, and no other remedy or remedies are available to Buyer, whether in law or equity. Buyer and Seller agree that the remedies contained herein are adequate remedies.","The provided clause is highly relevant to the query regarding **""seller-favorable cap on liability clauses""** as it demonstrates several key features that favor the seller in limiting their exposure to liability. Here’s a breakdown of its seller-favorable aspects:

### 1. **Cap on Liability**  
   - **Subsection (d)** explicitly limits the seller’s maximum liability to **""the invoice price of the Product(s) involved.""** This is a classic seller-favorable provision, as it caps liability at a predictable, transactional amount (the price paid) rather than exposing the seller to open-ended or disproportionate claims (e.g., lost profits or consequential damages).

### 2. **Exclusion of Consequential and Indirect Damages**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **special, incidental, punitive, consequential, indirect, or exemplary damages**, including **economic loss, lost profits, or goodwill**. This shields the seller from the most significant financial risks that could arise from breaches or disputes, even if such damages are foreseeable.  
   - This aligns with seller-favorable drafting, as buyers typically bear the risk of business losses beyond the direct value of the product.

### 3. **Exclusive Remedies**  
   - **Subsection (e)** states that the remedies in the contract (e.g., refund or replacement) are the **exclusive** options available to the buyer, barring claims under **law or equity** (e.g., statutory rights or common-law remedies).  
   - This prevents the buyer from seeking additional remedies (e.g., specific performance or injunctive relief, as referenced in the external examples from MAUD), further favoring the seller by confining recourse to contractual terms.

### 4. **Waiver of Equitable Remedies**  
   - While not explicit, the clause implies a waiver of equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions or specific performance) by emphasizing that the contractual remedies are **""adequate""** and exclusive. This contrasts with the external examples (e.g., MAUD 102 and 417), where parties expressly preserve equitable relief for breaches.  

### **Relevance to Query**  
The clause is a **textbook seller-favorable limitation of liability** because it:  
- Imposes a low, predictable cap on damages.  
- Excludes high-risk categories of damages (e.g., lost profits).  
- Restricts the buyer’s remedies to contractual terms, overriding statutory or common-law rights.  

**Comparison to External Examples:**  
The external clauses (MAUD 102/417) emphasize preserving equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, which is *buyer-favorable* in ensuring performance. In contrast, the provided clause prioritizes limiting the seller’s exposure, making it distinctly **seller-favorable**.  

**Practical Impact:**  
Sellers benefit from reduced litigation risk and financial exposure, while buyers assume most of the risk for broader business losses. Courts may scrutinize such clauses for enforceability (e.g., unconscionability), but they are common in commercial contracts where sellers seek to control liability.  

Would you like suggestions to further strengthen the seller’s position (e.g., adding a time limit for claims or carve-outs for gross negligence)?",5
buyer-favorable cap on liability clauses,395aab365a,"11.3. Liability Cap. Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The **""Liability Cap"" clause (Section 11.3)** is highly relevant to a **buyer-favorable cap on liability** in the following ways:

### Key Buyer-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Limitation of Liability**:
   - The clause caps the total liability of either party (including the seller, Accuray) to the **aggregate purchase prices paid by the buyer (Distributor) in the 12 months preceding a claim**. This protects the buyer by ensuring their maximum exposure is limited to a quantifiable, recent transactional amount, rather than open-ended or catastrophic liability.

2. **Exceptions Favoring the Buyer**:
   - While the cap applies broadly, the **exceptions** (e.g., unauthorized use of IP, intentional breach, or non-compliance with laws) are narrow and typically target **seller misconduct**. This means the buyer retains recourse for egregious acts by the seller, while routine breaches (e.g., delivery delays, minor defects) are subject to the cap.

3. **Temporal Limitation**:
   - The 12-month lookback period ensures the cap is tied to recent business activity, preventing liability from accumulating indefinitely. This is favorable to the buyer as it avoids disproportionate liability for older transactions.

4. **Offset Mechanism**:
   - The clause deducts amounts paid for **prior claims** within the same 12-month window, preventing ""double-dipping"" by the seller and ensuring the buyer’s total liability remains within the capped amount.

### Contrast with External Context:
The external examples (e.g., termination fees tied to acquisition proposals) highlight scenarios where liability is triggered by specific events (e.g., deal breaches). In contrast, **Section 11.3** is a **general liability cap** that applies to most claims under the agreement, making it a broader protective measure for the buyer.

### Why It’s Buyer-Favorable:
- **Predictability**: The buyer can anticipate maximum liability exposure based on recent purchase volumes.
- **Risk Allocation**: The seller bears uncapped liability only for intentional/willful acts, while the buyer’s liability for ordinary breaches is constrained.
- **Negotiated Balance**: The exceptions ensure the buyer isn’t left unprotected against bad-faith seller actions.

### Drafting Note:
For even stronger buyer protection, a buyer might negotiate:
- A **lower cap** (e.g., a percentage of annual purchases).
- **Explicit exclusions** for seller indemnities (e.g., third-party IP claims).
- **Carve-outs** for consequential damages (if not already addressed elsewhere).

This clause is a **pro-buyer** risk-management tool, typical in distribution agreements where liability exposure needs to align with transactional scales.",5

Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause **""11.4 Limitation of Liability""** is relevant to the query about **""buyer-favorable cap on liability clauses""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Buyer-Favorable Cap on Liability**  
   - The clause imposes a **strict monetary cap (AUD 50,000)** on Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s liability for losses arising from breaches or other claims under the agreement.  
   - This is **buyer-favorable** (if the Merchant is the buyer) because it limits the seller’s (Fiserv’s) maximum exposure, protecting the buyer from excessive claims beyond the agreed cap.  

### 2. **Exceptions to the Cap (Unfavorable to Buyer)**  
   - The clause **excludes** certain obligations from the liability cap, including:  
     - Fiserv’s duty to remit transaction proceeds (critical for the Merchant’s cash flow).  
     - The Merchant’s payment obligations (which remain uncapped, meaning the buyer could still face unlimited liability for fees, regulatory penalties, etc.).  
   - These exceptions **reduce the buyer’s protection**, as they leave key financial exposures uncapped.  

### 3. **Comparison to External Information**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** from MAUD_102) emphasize **equitable remedies (injunctions, specific performance)** for breaches, suggesting that monetary caps alone may not suffice in high-stakes agreements.  
   - Unlike the external examples, **this clause does not address non-monetary remedies**, meaning the buyer may have limited recourse beyond the AUD 50,000 cap for certain breaches.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **partially buyer-favorable** by capping general liability but **unfavorable in key areas** (e.g., payment obligations remain uncapped). A truly buyer-favorable clause would:  
   - Broaden the cap to cover more obligations (e.g., regulatory fines).  
   - Include carve-outs for **fraud, willful misconduct, or indemnification claims**.  
   - Align with equitable remedies (like specific performance) to ensure enforceability beyond monetary limits.  

Would you like suggestions for redrafting this clause to be more buyer-friendly?",5
buyer-favorable cap on liability clauses,f52cb3b7ad,"IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER’S OR SELLER’S LIABILITY, ONE TO THE OTHER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE RESPECTIVE OTHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD 13 MILLION; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BAD FAITH, INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The provided clause is a **cap on liability** provision that limits the maximum financial exposure of both the Buyer and Seller in the event of a breach of the agreement. Here’s how it relates to the query about **buyer-favorable cap on liability clauses**:

### Key Buyer-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Monetary Cap**:  
   - The clause caps liability at **USD 13 million** for breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants. This is favorable to the Buyer because it provides certainty about the maximum financial risk they could face (e.g., if Seller breaches obligations).  
   - Without this cap, the Buyer could theoretically face unlimited liability exposure for Seller’s breaches.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**:  
   - The clause carves out exceptions where the cap **does not apply**, such as for:  
     - **Bad faith, intentional/willful misconduct** (protecting the Buyer if the Seller acts maliciously).  
     - **Third-party claims for personal injury/property damage** (ensuring the Buyer isn’t shielded from liability for harm caused to third parties due to breaches).  
   - These exceptions are buyer-friendly because they ensure the Seller remains fully liable for egregious conduct or harm to third parties, which might otherwise indirectly impact the Buyer.

3. **Symmetry with Seller Protections**:  
   - While the clause applies equally to both parties, the Buyer benefits from the same limitations when facing claims from the Seller (e.g., if the Buyer breaches covenants).  
   - However, the Buyer may negotiate additional carve-outs (e.g., for fraud, indemnification claims, or fundamental breaches) to further tilt the balance in their favor.

### Relevance to External Context:  
The external information highlights provisions for **specific performance** and **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) as remedies for breaches. The liability cap clause complements these by:  
- Clarifying that **monetary damages** are limited (aligning with the notion that equitable remedies may be preferred in certain cases).  
- Ensuring the cap doesn’t restrict non-monetary remedies (e.g., injunctions), which are often critical for Buyers to enforce deal terms.  

### Suggested Buyer-Favorable Tweaks:  
To make the clause even more buyer-friendly, consider:  
- Adding **fraud** as an explicit exception to the cap.  
- Excluding **indemnification obligations** (common in M&A deals) from the cap.  
- Lowering the cap amount or making it asymmetric (e.g., higher for Seller breaches).  

In summary, this clause is a balanced but modifiable liability cap that provides Buyer protection while allowing for exceptions where unlimited liability is justified.",5

In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","The provided **""Limitation of Liability"" clause** is highly relevant to the query about **buyer-favorable caps on liability** because it imposes significant restrictions on the seller's liability, which may disadvantage the buyer. Here’s how the clause aligns with (or diverges from) buyer-favorable terms:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Certain Damages**:  
   - The clause waives claims for **punitive, exemplary, or statutory damages**, which are often sought in disputes to penalize wrongdoing or compensate for statutory violations. This is unfavorable to the buyer, as it limits potential recoveries.  

2. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**:  
   - The seller is shielded from liability for **indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption). This is a **seller-favorable** provision, as buyers typically want recourse for broader harms caused by breaches.  

3. **Cap on Total Liability**:  
   - The seller’s total liability is capped at **the purchase price paid for the products** (or the defective portion). This is a strict limitation that heavily favors the seller, as it may not cover the buyer’s actual losses (e.g., downstream damages or reputational harm).  

### Relevance to Buyer-Favorable Caps:
- A **buyer-favorable** cap would typically:  
  - Allow claims for **consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) if foreseeable.  
  - Set a higher liability cap (e.g., **multiple times the purchase price** or a fixed monetary threshold).  
  - Preserve statutory or punitive damages where applicable.  
- This clause does the **opposite**, making it **seller-favorable**.  

### Connection to External Context:  
The external references discuss **specific performance** and equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) but do not address liability caps. However, they highlight that parties may seek **non-monetary remedies** for breaches. If the buyer’s primary concern is enforcement (not damages), the clause’s liability limits might be less critical.  

### Suggested Buyer-Friendly Revisions:  
To make the clause more buyer-favorable:  
1. Remove the waiver of **statutory/punitive damages** (where legally permissible).  
2. Narrow the exclusion of **consequential damages** (e.g., carve out cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct).  
3. Increase the liability cap (e.g., **2–3x the purchase price** or a negotiated fixed amount).  

In summary, the current clause is **not buyer-favorable**—it heavily limits the seller’s exposure, which could leave the buyer undercompensated for significant breaches. Buyers should negotiate broader remedies and higher caps where possible.",5

Here’s how it aligns (or conflicts) with the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusive Remedies for Buyer** (Subsection a):  
   - The buyer’s sole remedies for defective goods/services are limited to **replacement or refund** of the purchase price.  
   - This is restrictive and favors the seller, as it excludes other potential remedies (e.g., damages for losses caused by defective goods).

2. **Cap on Liability** (Subsection b):  
   - Seller’s liability is **capped at the purchase price** of the goods/services in question, regardless of the legal theory (negligence, breach, etc.).  
   - Explicitly excludes liability for **removal/installation costs** and claims by **third parties** (further limiting buyer recourse).  

3. **Exclusion of Consequential/Indirect Damages** (Subsection c):  
   - Seller disclaims liability for **lost profits, punitive damages, or incidental damages**, even if the primary remedy fails.  
   - This is a strong seller protection, unfavorable to buyers who may suffer broader losses.  

4. **No Expansion of Liability** (Subsection d):  
   - Seller’s advice or recommendations do not create additional liability.  

### Relevance to Buyer-Favorable Terms:  
A **buyer-favorable** version of this clause would typically:  
- **Expand remedies** (e.g., allow for monetary damages beyond replacement/refund).  
- **Raise or remove the liability cap** (e.g., tie it to actual damages or a multiple of the contract value).  
- **Permit recovery of consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits due to defective goods).  
- **Include carve-outs** for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or IP infringement.  

### Contrast with External Information:  
The external examples (e.g., MAUD clauses) emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** as remedies for breaches, which are more favorable to the aggrieved party (often the buyer in M&A contexts). The provided clause, however, **restricts remedies** and **shields the seller**, making it **unfavorable to buyers**.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a **seller-friendly limitation of liability** that heavily restricts buyer remedies. To make it **buyer-favorable**, the buyer would need to negotiate:  
- Broader remedies (e.g., damages for breach).  
- Higher liability caps or exceptions for egregious conduct.  
- Inclusion of consequential damages in certain scenarios.

non-reliance clause,dd24d14bea,"20. No Reliance No third party is entitled to rely on any of the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement. The Parties assume no liability to any third party because of any reliance on the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement.","The **non-reliance clause** (Clause 20 in your example) is relevant to the query in the following ways:

### **1. Purpose of a Non-Reliance Clause**  
This clause explicitly states that **no third party** (e.g., shareholders, creditors, or other non-signatories) can rely on the representations, warranties, or agreements in the contract. It limits liability by ensuring that only the parties to the agreement (the ""Parties"") can enforce or be held accountable for the contractual terms.

### **2. Connection to the External Information**  
The external references discuss **representations and warranties** in the agreement, particularly their accuracy at signing and closing. These clauses ensure that the parties can enforce these terms if they are breached. However, the **non-reliance clause** clarifies that **third parties cannot use these same representations/warranties to make claims** against the parties.  

For example:  
- If a shareholder (a third party) tries to sue based on a misrepresentation in the agreement, the non-reliance clause would block such a claim.  
- It reinforces that **only the contracting parties** (e.g., the Company and Parent Parties in the external references) have rights under the agreement.

### **3. Risk Mitigation**  
This clause protects the parties from **unintended liability** to outsiders who might try to rely on the contract’s terms. It aligns with the broader contractual principle that **privity of contract** (rights and obligations being limited to the signatories) should be respected unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### **Conclusion**  
The non-reliance clause is a **protective measure** that complements the representations and warranties in the agreement by ensuring that **only the parties bound by the contract** can enforce or challenge its terms, preventing third-party claims.

non-reliance clause,539cc25466,"This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and is not binding upon or enforceable by any other persons No party to this Agreement may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and any assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void.","The clause you provided is **not a non-reliance clause** but rather a **""No Third-Party Beneficiaries"" and ""No Assignment"" clause**. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **No Third-Party Beneficiaries**:  
   - The clause states that the agreement is only for the benefit of the parties involved (the signatories) and cannot be enforced by any other persons (non-signatories).  
   - This is distinct from a non-reliance clause, which typically disclaims reliance on representations outside the contract and confirms that parties are entering the agreement based solely on its terms.

2. **No Assignment**:  
   - The clause also prohibits the assignment of rights or delegation of obligations under the agreement without consent.  
   - This is unrelated to non-reliance, as it governs transferability rather than representations or warranties.

### Relevance to the Query on ""Non-Reliance Clause"":  
A **non-reliance clause** would typically address:  
- Whether parties are relying on extra-contractual statements (e.g., oral or written representations outside the agreement).  
- Confirmation that the written contract supersedes all prior discussions.  
- Example language: *""Each party acknowledges that it has not relied on any representation or warranty other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement.""*  

The provided clause does not cover these concepts. However, the **external information** you shared (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) discusses **specific performance and injunctive relief** for breaches, which could indirectly relate to reliance issues if a party breaches by misrepresenting facts. But the clause itself is not a non-reliance provision.

### Key Takeaway:  
If you’re looking for a **non-reliance clause**, focus on provisions where parties disclaim reliance on extrinsic statements or limit liability for pre-contractual representations. The clause you provided is about **third-party rights and assignment restrictions**.

non-reliance clause,09fb729f2f,"10.5 No Other Representations or Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR NON-MISAPPROPRIATION OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ARE MADE OR GIVEN BY OR ON BEHALF OF A PARTY. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.","The **""No Other Representations or Warranties""** clause (Clause 10.5) is a **non-reliance clause**, which directly addresses the query. Here’s how it relates to the concept of non-reliance and the external context provided:

### Key Aspects of the Non-Reliance Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that **no representations or warranties** (express or implied) are made by either party **except those expressly stated in the agreement**. This includes common implied warranties like merchantability, fitness for a purpose, or non-infringement.  
   - By doing so, it ensures that parties cannot later claim reliance on statements or assurances made outside the contract (e.g., during negotiations).  

2. **Purpose of Non-Reliance**:  
   - It protects parties from liability for **pre-contractual statements** or **omissions** not included in the final agreement.  
   - It reinforces that the written contract is the **exclusive source** of enforceable obligations, preventing disputes over ""side promises"" or informal understandings.  

3. **Link to External Context**:  
   - The external excerpts (from Pages 98 and 107) highlight conditions where representations/warranties must be true at specific times (e.g., at the ""Expiration Time"" or ""consummation of the Offer"").  
   - Clause 10.5 complements these by clarifying that **only the representations/warranties explicitly listed in the agreement** matter—no others can be relied upon. This narrows the scope of what must be ""true and correct"" under the conditions described in the external text.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
A non-reliance clause like 10.5 is critical in contracts to:  
- **Limit liability**: Parties cannot sue for breaches of unwritten or implied terms.  
- **Ensure certainty**: The agreement’s terms are the sole basis for legal claims.  
- **Align with conditions**: As seen in the external snippets, it ties directly to which representations/warranties are enforceable (e.g., only those ""set forth in the Agreement"").  

In short, Clause 10.5 is a **strong non-reliance provision** that carves out all representations/warranties not expressly included in the contract, which is consistent with the conditional language in the external examples.",5
non-reliance clause,aab80656b9,"E. Except as set forth in paragraphs 9(a) through 9(d) inclusive of this agreement, with respect to its EDP services or other work provided under this agreement, VIP makes no warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose except as set forth in paragraphs 9(a) through 9(d) inclusive of this agreement, VIP does not warrant that the services shall meet BNL's requirements or that the services shall be uninterrupted or error-free.","The clause you provided is a **warranty disclaimer** and **limitation of liability** provision, which is closely related to the concept of a **non-reliance clause** in legal contracts. Here’s how it connects to your query about a non-reliance clause:

### **Relevance to a Non-Reliance Clause:**
1. **Purpose of a Non-Reliance Clause:**  
   - A non-reliance clause is designed to ensure that one party (e.g., the customer, BNL in this case) does not rely on any representations, warranties, or assurances outside of what is explicitly stated in the contract.  
   - It prevents claims based on extra-contractual statements (e.g., oral promises, marketing materials, or informal discussions).  

2. **How This Clause Functions Similarly:**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **all implied warranties** (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) except those expressly stated in **paragraphs 9(a)-9(d)**.  
   - It further clarifies that VIP does **not guarantee** that the services will meet BNL’s requirements or be error-free.  
   - This effectively means BNL **cannot claim reliance** on any promises or assurances beyond what is written in the specified sections of the agreement.  

3. **Effect (Similar to Non-Reliance):**  
   - By disclaiming warranties and limiting guarantees, VIP is ensuring that BNL **does not rely on any broader assurances** than those explicitly provided.  
   - This protects VIP from liability if BNL later claims it expected better performance or additional assurances not documented in the contract.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
While not explicitly labeled as a ""non-reliance clause,"" this provision serves a **similar protective function** by:  
- **Narrowing the scope of enforceable promises** (only those in paragraphs 9(a)-9(d)).  
- **Disclaiming extra-contractual assurances** (e.g., implied warranties, oral statements).  
- **Preventing claims based on unmet expectations** (e.g., services not being ""error-free"").  

Thus, it aligns with the intent of a non-reliance clause by **limiting what the other party can legally rely on** under the agreement.

ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.","The clause you provided is a **non-reliance clause**, which is directly relevant to your query. Here's how it connects:

### Key Aspects of a Non-Reliance Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Extra-Contractual Representations**:  
   The clause explicitly states that **no representations or warranties** (express or implied) exist **except those expressly stated in the agreement**. This prevents either party from claiming they relied on statements or assurances made outside the contract (e.g., in negotiations or marketing materials).

2. **Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   It specifically disclaims implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a purpose, non-infringement), which might otherwise arise under law (e.g., the UCC in the U.S. or common law principles). This narrows the scope of liability strictly to the contractual terms.

3. **Purpose in Transactions**:  
   Non-reliance clauses are common in M&A, commercial contracts, or financing deals to:  
   - Limit disputes over ""side promises"" or oral statements.  
   - Allocate risk by clarifying that parties are only relying on the written terms of the agreement.  

### Connection to the External Information:  
The external excerpts discuss **conditions to an offer** where representations/warranties must be true at closing. The non-reliance clause complements this by:  
- Defining the **universe of actionable representations** (only those in the agreement).  
- Ensuring parties cannot later argue that other unstated representations influenced their decision.  

### Why It Matters:  
Without this clause, a party might claim they entered the agreement based on external assurances (e.g., ""We thought the software was defect-free because of their sales pitch""). The clause **shifts the risk** of such misunderstandings to the relying party and reinforces the ""four corners of the agreement"" rule.  

In short, this clause is a **risk-management tool** that reinforces the exclusivity of contractual terms and limits liability to what’s explicitly agreed upon.",5

Here’s how it relates:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **""As Is"" Basis**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that materials and services are provided **""as is""**, meaning the recipient accepts them in their current condition, with all faults and without any guarantees (unless expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement).

2. **Disclaimer of Warranties**:  
   - It disclaims **all implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement) unless specifically outlined in the agreement.  
   - This limits liability for defects or issues not covered by the contract’s express terms.

3. **Alignment with External Context**:  
   - The external information (e.g., Section 9.10 on *Specific Performance*) reinforces that parties waive defenses claiming ""adequate remedy at law,"" which complements the ""as-is"" clause by emphasizing contractual remedies over statutory or common-law claims.  
   - The omitted conditions (e.g., representations/warranties being true at consummation) contrast with the ""as-is"" clause, which excludes such assurances unless explicitly stated.

### Relevance to Your Query:  
The clause answers the query by:  
- Defining the scope of liability (or lack thereof) for materials/services provided.  
- Clarifying that no party guarantees quality or performance beyond what is expressly written in the agreement.  
- Shifting risk to the recipient, who must rely on due diligence rather than implied protections.  

This is typical in transactions where parties want to limit post-closing disputes over latent defects or unmet expectations. The clause’s enforceability may depend on jurisdiction-specific laws (e.g., UCC for goods) and exceptions noted in other sections (e.g., Section 8.3(d)).

Here’s how it aligns with the query and the external context:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **""As-Is"" Provision**:  
   - The clause states that services are provided **""as is""**, meaning the recipient accepts them in their current condition without any guarantees or warranties from the provider (MLX or HCI).  
   - This mirrors common legal language used to limit liability and shift risk to the receiving party.

2. **Exclusion of Warranties**:  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **all representations, warranties, or conditions** (express or implied), including:  
     - **Implied warranties** like merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or uninterrupted/error-free operation.  
     - Warranties arising by statute, course of dealing, or trade usage.  
   - This aligns with the external information (from the MAUD document), where representations and warranties are strictly limited to specific terms and timelines (e.g., ""as of the Effective Time"").  

3. **Exceptions**:  
   - The disclaimer does not apply to warranties or guarantees **explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement** or agreed to in writing by the parties. This ensures flexibility for negotiated terms while maintaining a default ""as-is"" baseline.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause answers the query by demonstrating how an **""as-is"" provision** operates in practice:  
  - It **limits the provider’s liability** by disclaiming implied warranties.  
  - It **shifts risk** to the recipient, who must rely on their own due diligence.  
  - It aligns with the external context (MAUD), where warranties are narrowly defined and tied to specific conditions (e.g., ""as of the Effective Time"").  

### Practical Implications:  
- A party relying on services under this agreement cannot claim breach for defects or failures unless they secured **written guarantees**.  
- Courts typically enforce such clauses strictly, barring fraud or unconscionability.  

In summary, this clause is a textbook example of an **""as-is"" disclaimer**, reinforcing the principle that services are provided without assurances unless expressly agreed otherwise. The external context further supports the idea that warranties are narrowly construed in contracts.",5

### Relevance of the Provided Clause to the ""As-Is"" Query:  
The clause you provided is a **strong example of an ""as-is"" clause** because it:  
1. **Disclaims All Warranties** – It explicitly states that the parties disclaim all express and implied warranties (e.g., title, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose). This is a hallmark of an ""as-is"" provision.  
2. **Limits Liability** – It excludes liability for damages arising from the use of the trademarks and related rights, including special, consequential, or punitive damages. This reinforces the ""as-is"" nature of the transaction.  
3. **Shifts Risk to the Buyer/Licensee** – By disclaiming warranties and liability, the clause ensures that the recipient (MusclePharm, in this case) bears the risk of any defects or issues with the intellectual property.  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts discuss **specific performance and injunctive relief** (rather than ""as-is"" clauses), they highlight how contracts often include remedies for breaches. In contrast, your clause **limits remedies** by disclaiming warranties and liability—effectively preventing claims based on the condition of the trademarks.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause is a **classic ""as-is"" provision** because it:  
- Denies any guarantees about the IP's quality or legal status.  
- Protects the licensor (the ""AS Parties"") from liability.  
- Ensures the licensee accepts the IP in its existing state, without recourse for hidden defects.

Here’s how it relates to the query and the external context:

### **Relevance to the Query (""as-is"" clause)**  
1. **Purpose of an ""As-Is"" Clause**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the licensed rights are provided **without any warranties**, meaning the licensor does not guarantee functionality, quality, or legal compliance (e.g., non-infringement).  
   - It excludes implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) that might otherwise apply under law (e.g., the UCC in the U.S.).  

2. **Connection to External Context**  
   - The external excerpts discuss **remedies for breach** (e.g., injunctive relief, specific performance) but do not directly address warranties. However, they highlight that parties may seek equitable relief for breaches—implying that contractual disclaimers (like the ""as-is"" clause) could limit claims for damages related to warranties.  
   - The ""as-is"" clause **reinforces the parties’ intent** to exclude warranty-based liabilities, which aligns with the broader contractual framework where remedies are tailored to breaches of agreed terms (not implied obligations).  

3. **Legal Effect**  
   - By disclaiming warranties, the clause **shifts risk** to the licensee, who accepts the licensed material with all faults. This could limit the licensee’s recourse if the licensed material fails to meet expectations.  
   - In disputes, courts typically enforce such disclaimers if they are **clear and unambiguous** (as here), barring claims for breach of warranty.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The ""as-is"" clause is **highly relevant** to the query because it defines the scope of warranties (or lack thereof) in the agreement. While the external excerpts focus on enforcement mechanisms, this clause operates upstream by **limiting the grounds for liability** in the first place. Together, these provisions shape the parties’ rights and remedies:  
- The enforcement clauses (external text) govern how breaches are addressed.  
- The ""as-is"" clause narrows what constitutes a breach (e.g., no claim for breach of implied warranties).

Kubient makes no representation or warranty and expressly disclaims, and Customer understands and acknowledges, that there is no guarantee that any minimum level of revenue or profit will be generated by either Party as a result of the Services or this Agreement.","The **""as-is"" clause** in the provided contract (Section 13, ""Disclaimer"") is a standard legal provision that limits the liability of the provider (Kubient) by disclaiming all implied warranties and representations about the Services, except those explicitly stated in the Agreement. Here’s how it relates to your query and the external context:

### Relevance to the Query (""as-is"" clause):
1. **Definition of ""As-Is""**:  
   The clause explicitly states that the Services are provided **""as is,"" ""where is,"" and ""as available""**, which means:
   - The customer accepts the Services in their current condition, with no guarantees of quality, performance, or fitness for a particular purpose.
   - Kubient disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a purpose) unless expressly stated otherwise in the Agreement.

2. **Connection to External Context**:  
   The external excerpts discuss **representations and warranties** in agreements and their conditions (e.g., being ""true and correct"" at specific times). The ""as-is"" clause aligns with this by:
   - **Excluding implied warranties**: Similar to how the external clauses carve out certain representations (e.g., clauses (i)–(iii) in Annex I), the ""as-is"" clause carves out *only* the warranties expressly stated in the Agreement, disclaiming all others.
   - **Shifting risk to the customer**: The clause ensures that Kubient is not liable for failures or shortcomings of the Services beyond what is explicitly promised in the contract.

3. **Key Implications**:
   - **Waiver of implied warranties**: The customer waives rights to claims based on unwritten assurances (e.g., common law or statutory warranties).
   - **No guaranteed outcomes**: The clause explicitly states there is no guarantee of revenue or profit, reinforcing the ""as-is"" nature of the Services.
   - **Alignment with contract precision**: Like the external examples, this clause clarifies that only *specific* representations in the Agreement are binding, and all others are excluded.

### Why This Matters:
- The ""as-is"" clause protects Kubient from liability for unforeseen issues or failures of the Services, limiting their obligations to only what is written in the contract.
- It mirrors the contractual logic in the external examples, where certain representations are singled out as binding, while others are disclaimed.

In summary, this clause is a robust **risk-allocation tool** that defines the scope of warranties and aligns with broader contractual principles seen in the external context (e.g., limiting liability to expressly stated terms).",5
"""as is"" clause with carveouts",40d6fdec6e,"7. Warranties. Except as provided in Section 1.2 of this Development Agreement, Cargill makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, with respect to the services provided under this Development Agreement and with respect to the subject matter of this Development Agreement. The services are provided ""as is"" and Bioamber acknowledges that it bears all responsibility and accountability for evaluating, approving, and implementing any of results resulting from this Development Agreement.","The query asks about an **""as is"" clause with carveouts**, and the provided clause from the Development Agreement is a classic example of such a provision. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **""As Is"" Clause**  
The clause explicitly states that Cargill provides the services **""as is""** and disclaims all **express or implied warranties** unless otherwise specified. This is a standard ""as is"" provision, meaning the recipient (Bioamber) accepts the services in their current condition, with all faults, and without recourse for defects or inaccuracies unless explicitly carved out.

### 2. **Carveouts**  
The clause includes a carveout:  
> *""Except as provided in Section 1.2 of this Development Agreement...""*  

This means that while Cargill generally disclaims warranties, **Section 1.2** likely contains specific representations, warranties, or guarantees that are preserved (e.g., compliance with laws, minimum performance standards, etc.). Carveouts modify the broad ""as is"" disclaimer by preserving certain agreed-upon protections.

### 3. **Relevance to External Information**  
The external examples (from a merger agreement) show how representations/warranties can be qualified (e.g., ""true and correct in all material respects"" with exceptions). While those examples are more detailed, the **Development Agreement clause** follows a similar structure:  
- Broad disclaimer (""as is"") +  
- Limited carveout (Section 1.2) +  
- Explicit acknowledgment of the recipient’s responsibility (similar to a ""buyer beware"" clause).  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause is a concise ""as is"" provision with a carveout, demonstrating how parties can allocate risk by disclaiming warranties while preserving specific obligations elsewhere in the contract. The external examples highlight how such clauses can be layered with materiality qualifiers or adverse effect thresholds, but the core principle remains the same.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **""As Is"" Basis**  
The clause explicitly states that materials and services are provided **""on an 'as is' basis""**, meaning the recipient accepts them in their current condition without any guarantees or warranties (unless explicitly stated otherwise). This is a standard way to limit liability for defects or issues that may exist at the time of delivery.

### 2. **Carveouts (Exceptions)**  
The clause includes a carveout with the phrase:  
**""EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT""**.  
This means that while most warranties are disclaimed, any representations or warranties **explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement** still apply. For example:  
- If another section of the agreement guarantees the quality of materials or services, those warranties override the ""as is"" disclaimer.  
- The external information references representations/warranties that must be ""true and correct"" (e.g., Annex I, Page 107), which could be such carveouts.  

### 3. **Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
The clause goes further to disclaim **all implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a purpose, non-infringement), unless carved out elsewhere. This reinforces the ""as is"" nature of the provision.  

### 4. **Relevance to External Context**  
- The external text from *maud_898* hints at representations/warranties that must be true at closing, which likely qualify as carveouts to the ""as is"" clause.  
- The *maud_446* excerpt discusses **specific performance** (enforcement of contractual terms), which could interact with the ""as is"" clause if a party breaches a carved-out warranty.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause is a **broad disclaimer with limited carveouts**, typical in contracts to shift risk to the recipient while preserving specific negotiated warranties. The carveouts ensure that certain critical promises (if any) remain enforceable despite the ""as is"" language.

This clause shall survive termination of this JSMA.","The query asks about an **""as is"" clause with carveouts**, which typically disclaims all warranties and liabilities (i.e., the subject matter is provided in its current condition) but includes exceptions (""carveouts"") for specific representations, warranties, or obligations.  

### Relevance of the Provided Clause to the Query:  
The **indemnification clause** (Section 12) is not directly an ""as is"" clause but interacts with similar concepts in the following ways:  

1. **Implied Connection to ""As Is""**:  
   - An ""as is"" clause often limits liability for defects or breaches, but carveouts may preserve certain indemnification rights. Here, the indemnification clause explicitly holds each party liable for:  
     - Negligence/gross negligence/intentional acts.  
     - Breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants.  
   - These carveouts could align with exceptions to an ""as is"" disclaimer (e.g., if the ""as is"" clause excludes intentional misconduct or specific warranties).  

2. **Specific Performance Context (from External Info)**:  
   - The external information references **specific performance** and injunctive relief for breaches, suggesting the agreement prioritizes enforcing certain obligations despite general limitations.  
   - Similarly, the indemnification clause ensures financial remedies for breaches, which could function as a carveout to broader liability disclaimers (like ""as is"").  

3. **Survival Clause**:  
   - Subsection 12.3 states the indemnification obligations survive termination, reinforcing that these liabilities are **not waived** even if other provisions (e.g., ""as is"" warranties) expire.  

### Key Takeaway:  
While not an ""as is"" clause itself, this indemnification clause **acts as a carveout mechanism** by preserving liability for specific scenarios (negligence, breaches of covenants, etc.). In a contract with an ""as is"" provision, such indemnification terms would likely serve as explicit exceptions to the general disclaimer of warranties/liabilities.  

For a complete analysis, you’d need to review the actual ""as is"" clause in the agreement, but this indemnification clause demonstrates how parties might allocate risk *despite* broader disclaimers.

"""as is"" clause with carveouts",a685483a0f,"5. Sponsor's Maximum Obligation; Indemnification. Racing represents to the Sponsor that the Sponsor's aggregate obligation hereunder will not exceed the amount of the sponsorship fee set forth in Section 3 hereof (or such lesser amount as is payable by the Sponsor in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof), plus, if applicable, collection costs that may be reasonably incurred by Racing in a legal proceeding to collect all or any part thereof (the ""Maximum Obligation""). Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors, agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.","The query asks about an **""as is"" clause with carveouts**, which typically disclaims all warranties or liabilities (i.e., the subject matter is accepted ""as is"") but includes exceptions (carveouts) for specific scenarios. While the provided **clause (Section 5)** is not a classic ""as is"" clause, it has **similar functional elements** and **carveout-like provisions** that align with the query’s theme:

### Relevance to the Query:
1. **""As Is"" Equivalent**:  
   - The clause **limits the Sponsor’s liability** to a defined ""Maximum Obligation"" (the sponsorship fee plus collection costs), effectively capping exposure. This mirrors the risk-allocation function of an ""as is"" clause by disclaiming liability beyond the agreed amount.  
   - However, it is not a pure ""as is"" disclaimer because it does not explicitly state that Racing makes no warranties about the sponsorship’s outcomes or conditions.

2. **Carveout-Like Exceptions**:  
   - The indemnification provision acts as a **carveout** to the liability cap. Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor for losses **exceeding the Maximum Obligation** if they arise from:  
     - (i) The Agreement itself, or  
     - (ii) Racing’s failure to perform its obligations.  
   - This creates an exception where Racing assumes additional liability for its own breaches or Agreement-related claims, similar to how carveouts in ""as is"" clauses preserve liability for specific risks (e.g., fraud, willful misconduct).

3. **Connection to External Context**:  
   - The external information highlights clauses about **specific performance** (enforcing contractual terms) and **exceptions to restrictions** (e.g., actions permitted by law or other agreement sections). These reinforce the idea that contracts often pair broad limitations (""as is"" or liability caps) with tailored exceptions (carveouts).  
   - Here, the indemnification carveout ensures the Sponsor is protected against Racing’s failures, balancing the otherwise one-sided liability limit.

### Key Takeaway:  
While not a traditional ""as is"" clause, **Section 5** functions analogously by:  
- Imposing a **default liability limit** (akin to ""as is"" disclaimers).  
- **Carving out exceptions** for Racing’s breaches or Agreement-related claims (indemnification).  

This structure aligns with the query’s focus on **limitations with exceptions**, even if the terminology differs. For a classic ""as is"" clause, you’d expect explicit disclaimers of warranties/liabilities, but the principle of ""limit + carveouts"" is similar.

"""as is"" clause with carveouts",5bb8ac4730,"EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE AS PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRADEMARKS AND NAME AND APPEARANCE RIGHTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE AS PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO MUSCLEPHARM OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO MUSCLEPHARM'S USE OF THE TRADEMARKS AND NAME AND APPEARANCE RIGHTS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AS PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.","The clause you provided is an **""as is"" clause with carveouts**, which is directly relevant to your query. Here's how it aligns with the concept:

### 1. **""As Is"" Clause**  
The clause states that the parties disclaim all representations and warranties (express or implied) regarding the trademarks and related rights, including warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose. This is a classic **""as is"" provision**, meaning the recipient (MusclePharm) accepts the assets in their current condition without any guarantees from the provider (the ""AS Parties"").

### 2. **Carveouts**  
The phrase **""EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN""** introduces a carveout. This means that while most warranties are disclaimed, there may be **specific exceptions elsewhere in the agreement** where certain representations or warranties are explicitly provided. For example:
   - The agreement might elsewhere include a limited warranty about ownership of the trademarks.
   - It could carve out liabilities for fraud or willful misconduct.

### 3. **Limitation of Liability**  
The clause further limits liability by:
   - Excluding damages arising from the use of the trademarks.
   - Barring claims for **special, consequential, or punitive damages** (a common feature in ""as is"" clauses to cap risk).

### Relevance to External Information  
While the external excerpts focus on **specific performance and injunctive relief** (enforcement mechanisms for breaches), your clause deals with **risk allocation** by disclaiming warranties and limiting liability. Together, these concepts show how contracts:
   - Allocate risk upfront (""as is"" with carveouts).
   - Provide remedies for breaches (specific performance, as in the external examples).

### Key Takeaway  
Your clause is a **risk-shifting tool** typical in asset transfers, where the seller avoids guarantees (unless carved out) and the buyer assumes responsibility for due diligence. The carveout ensures flexibility if certain assurances are negotiated.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **""As Is"" Basis**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that materials/services are provided **""as is""**, meaning the recipient accepts them in their current condition without any guarantees or assurances from the provider.  
   - This is a broad disclaimer of liability for defects, quality, or performance issues.

2. **Exclusion of Warranties**:  
   - The clause disclaims **all representations and warranties** (express or implied) unless expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement.  
   - It specifically negates implied warranties like **merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement**, which are typically presumed under law (e.g., UCC in the U.S.) unless explicitly waived.

3. **Unqualified Nature**:  
   - The disclaimer is **absolute** (""NO PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES"") except for what is ""expressly set forth"" in the agreement.  
   - There are no carve-outs for fraud, gross negligence, or third-party claims, which could make it riskier for the recipient.

### Relevance to the Query:
- An unqualified ""as is"" clause like this **shifts all risk** to the recipient, limiting the provider’s liability to the narrowest possible scope.  
- It contrasts with the **external information** provided:  
  - The *Specific Performance* clause (Maud_446) emphasizes remedies for breach, while the ""as is"" clause aims to **prevent claims** altogether by disclaiming warranties.  
  - The *Conditions to the Offer* (Maud_898) requires certain representations to be true at closing, whereas the ""as is"" clause negates such assurances unless explicitly stated.  

### Potential Issues:
- **Enforceability**: Some jurisdictions may limit unqualified disclaimers, especially for consumer contracts or cases involving fraud.  
- **Negotiation Point**: A recipient might push for exceptions (e.g., fundamental breaches, IP infringement, or compliance with laws).  

In summary, this clause is a **strong, unqualified ""as is"" provision** that broadly disclaims warranties and liabilities, directly addressing the query’s focus on the risks and implications of such language.",5

### Relevance of the Clause to the Query:  
The provided clause (Section 13) is a **broad and unqualified ""as is"" disclaimer** because:  
1. **Exclusion of Warranties**:  
   - It explicitly states that the services are provided **""as is""** without any representations, warranties, or conditions, **unless specifically agreed in writing**.  
   - It disclaims both **express and implied warranties**, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and those arising by statute or trade usage.  

2. **No Materiality or Knowledge Qualifiers**:  
   - Unlike some ""as is"" clauses that may include qualifiers (e.g., ""to the best of the seller's knowledge""), this clause is **absolute**—it does not limit the disclaimer based on the provider's awareness of defects or materiality of breaches.  
   - The external references (from MAUD) discuss representations and warranties being assessed at specific times (e.g., Effective Time), but the clause here does **not** include such temporal or accuracy-based qualifications.  

3. **Broad Scope of Disclaimed Liabilities**:  
   - The clause covers **all aspects of service performance**, including errors, interruptions, and display issues, reinforcing its unqualified nature.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause is a **strong example of an unqualified ""as is"" provision** because it:  
- Leaves **no room for implied protections** beyond what is expressly stated in the agreement.  
- Does **not** include exceptions for latent defects, fraud, or material breaches (unless separately agreed in writing).  
- Aligns with the query by demonstrating how such clauses **shift all risk** to the recipient of the services.

THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, REGARDING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.","The clause you provided is a standard **""as is"" clause**, specifically disclaiming all representations and warranties not expressly stated in the agreement. Here’s how it relates to your query about an **unqualified ""as is"" clause**:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement), which are typically presumed under common law or statutes (e.g., UCC in the U.S.).  
   - This is a hallmark of an **""as is"" provision**, signaling that the buyer accepts the subject matter in its current condition without reliance on any assurances beyond the contract’s express terms.

2. **""No Other Representations"" Language**:  
   - The clause states that the express warranties in the agreement replace **all other representations**, whether oral, written, or statutory.  
   - This reinforces the **unqualified** nature of the disclaimer—it leaves no room for exceptions unless explicitly carved out elsewhere in the agreement.

3. **Contrast with External Information**:  
   - The external excerpts (from MAUD_764 and MAUD_542) reference representations and warranties that must be **""true and correct in all respects""** at closing.  
   - Your clause, however, **negates any such guarantees beyond the express terms**, effectively shifting risk to the counterparty (often the buyer). This creates tension if the agreement elsewhere requires strict compliance with warranties—your clause would need to be reconciled with those provisions to avoid ambiguity.

### Why It’s ""Unqualified"":
- An unqualified ""as is"" clause lacks exceptions (e.g., for fraud, fundamental breaches, or specific disclaimers). Your example is **broad and absolute**, with no carve-outs for:  
  - Knowledge qualifiers (e.g., ""to the seller’s knowledge"").  
  - Survival periods for certain warranties.  
  - Statutory rights that cannot be disclaimed (e.g., consumer protections).  

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Allocation**: Favors the seller by limiting liability post-closing.  
- **Enforceability**: Courts generally uphold such clauses if clear and conspicuous, but may invalidate them if found unconscionable or if fraud is alleged.  
- **Drafting Note**: To avoid disputes, ensure the clause aligns with other sections (e.g., indemnification, survival terms) and complies with applicable law (e.g., some jurisdictions restrict disclaimers of implied warranties).  

In summary, your clause is a **strong, unqualified ""as is"" provision** that disclaims all non-express warranties, contrasting with the external examples where warranties are affirmatively required to be true at closing. This discrepancy would need careful review in a full contract analysis.",5

ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.","The clause you provided is a classic **""as is"" clause**, specifically an **unqualified ""as is"" clause**, which is directly relevant to your query. Here's how:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of All Representations/Warranties Except Those Expressly Stated**:  
   The clause explicitly states that **no representations or warranties** (express or implied) are made by either party **except those expressly stated in the agreement**. This creates a strict boundary: only the warranties explicitly listed in the contract apply, and all others are excluded.

2. **Broad Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   The clause goes further to disclaim common implied warranties, such as:  
   - **Merchantability** (fitness for ordinary use)  
   - **Fitness for a particular purpose**  
   - **Non-infringement** (of third-party IP rights)  
   - **Non-misappropriation** (of third-party IP)  

   This is a strong, **unqualified** exclusion because it does not allow for exceptions beyond the express terms of the agreement.

3. **Exclusion of Statutory or Common Law Warranties**:  
   The phrase *""whether arising by operation of law or otherwise""* ensures that even warranties that might otherwise be imposed by law (e.g., under the UCC in the U.S. or other jurisdictions) are **excluded unless explicitly stated in the contract**.

### Relevance to the Query (""Unqualified 'as is' Clause""):
- An **unqualified ""as is"" clause** means there are **no carve-outs or exceptions** beyond what is expressly stated in the agreement.  
- The clause you provided is **unqualified** because it does not:  
  - Allow for any implied warranties to survive.  
  - Permit any statutory or common-law warranties to apply.  
  - Include language like *""except as required by law""* or *""to the fullest extent permitted by law,""* which might soften its effect.  

### Connection to External Information:
The external references discuss **conditions where representations/warranties must be true at closing** (e.g., ""as of the consummation of the Offer""). Your clause, however, **limits those warranties strictly to what is written in the agreement** and excludes all others. This means:  
- If a party later claims a breach of an **implied warranty** (e.g., fitness for a particular purpose), this clause would **bar that claim** unless the warranty was explicitly included elsewhere in the agreement.  
- Courts generally enforce such clauses **strictly** unless there is fraud, ambiguity, or a statutory override (e.g., consumer protection laws).  

### Practical Implications:
- **Favors the Seller/Disclosing Party**: This clause shifts risk to the buyer/recipient by forcing them to rely **only** on the express warranties negotiated in the contract.  
- **Negotiation Point**: A buyer might push to:  
  - Qualify the clause (e.g., *""except as otherwise provided by mandatory law""*).  
  - Carve out specific implied warranties (e.g., non-infringement).  
  - Include a fraud exception.  

### Conclusion:
This is a **strong, unqualified ""as is"" clause** that eliminates all representations and warranties not expressly stated in the agreement, making it highly protective of the party giving the disclaimer. Its relevance to your query lies in its **uncompromising exclusion of any implied or extra-contractual assurances**.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.","The clause you provided (Section 10.5 ""No Other Representations or Warranties"") is a classic example of an **unqualified ""as is"" clause** in a contract. Here's how it relates to your query and the external context:

### Key Characteristics of an Unqualified ""As Is"" Clause:
1. **Exclusion of All Implied Warranties**: The clause explicitly disclaims all representations and warranties not expressly stated in the agreement, including implied warranties like merchantability, fitness for a purpose, and non-infringement. This creates an ""as is"" transaction where the recipient takes the subject matter with all its flaws, without recourse for undisclosed issues.

2. **Broad Language**: Phrases like ""NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER"" and ""ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED"" leave no room for ambiguity. This is stronger than a qualified ""as is"" clause, which might carve out exceptions (e.g., for fraud or fundamental breaches).

3. **Relevance to the External Context**:  
   - The external excerpts (from Pages 98 and 107) describe conditions where certain representations/warranties must be true at specific times (e.g., at the ""Expiration Time"" or ""consummation of the Offer"").  
   - In contrast, **Section 10.5 overrides any implied warranties that might otherwise survive under law**, even if other sections require specific representations to be true. This creates tension: the agreement may enforce express warranties while negating all others.  
   - If a dispute arises, the unqualified ""as is"" language could limit claims to **only the express warranties** identified elsewhere in the agreement, excluding gaps or omissions.

### Why This Matters for Your Query:
- An unqualified ""as is"" clause shifts **maximum risk to the counterparty** (often the buyer or recipient). It is common in asset sales, mergers, or software licensing where the seller seeks to limit post-closing liability.  
- The clause's strength depends on jurisdiction (some courts may not enforce it if it conflicts with statutory protections or public policy).  
- Compare this to the external excerpts: those clauses focus on **conditions precedent** (specific warranties that must be true to close the deal), while Section 10.5 is a **blanket disclaimer** that operates independently.  

### Practical Implications:
- **For the party relying on the clause (e.g., seller)**: It provides a strong defense against claims based on undisclosed defects.  
- **For the counterparty (e.g., buyer)**: Due diligence becomes critical, as they cannot rely on implied protections.  
- **Drafting Note**: If the agreement elsewhere includes survival clauses for certain warranties, ensure they are explicitly carved out from Section 10.5 to avoid contradictions.  

In summary, this clause is a **paradigmatic unqualified ""as is"" provision** that complements (but may conflict with) conditional representations in other sections. Its enforceability depends on how courts reconcile it with the rest of the contract.",5

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The provided **warranty disclaimer clause** is directly relevant to the query, which seeks a clause disclaiming implied warranties. Here’s how the clause addresses the request:

1. **Exclusive Warranties**  
   The clause explicitly states that the warranties in the agreement are the **only warranties** provided by the parties, excluding any other warranties—whether **express, implied, or statutory**. This aligns with the query’s focus on disclaiming implied warranties.

2. **Express Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
   The clause **expressly disclaims** all other warranties, including implied warranties such as:  
   - **Merchantability** (a common implied warranty under the UCC and other laws)  
   - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (another standard implied warranty)  
   - **Non-Infringement** (unless expressly stated in the agreement)  

   This ensures that no unintended warranties are imposed by law beyond what is explicitly agreed upon.

3. **Relevance to External References**  
   The external references (e.g., *maud_898*, *maud_100*) discuss representations and warranties being true at specific times (e.g., consummation of the Offer). While those clauses focus on **conditions to an offer**, the provided disclaimer clause complements them by clarifying that **no additional warranties** (implied or otherwise) apply beyond the written agreement.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause effectively **narrows liability** by:  
- Limiting warranties to **only those stated in the agreement**.  
- Explicitly **excluding implied warranties** (merchantability, fitness, non-infringement).  
- Preventing any **statutory or common-law warranties** from applying unless expressly included.  

This ensures legal clarity and aligns with standard contract practices where parties seek to define—and limit—their obligations strictly to the written terms.

Here’s how the clause aligns with the request:

### Key Relevance Points:
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **all implied warranties**, including but not limited to:  
     - **Merchantability** (fitness for ordinary use)  
     - **Fitness for a particular purpose**  
     - **Noninfringement**  
     - **Satisfactory quality**  
     - Warranties arising from **course of dealing, law, or trade practice**.  
   - This directly addresses the query’s focus on implied warranties.

2. **Compliance with Applicable Law**  
   - The disclaimer is qualified by ""**to the extent allowed by applicable law**,"" acknowledging jurisdictional variations (e.g., some states/jurisdictions may not permit certain exclusions).  
   - It includes a fallback provision limiting the duration of any unavoidable implied warranty to the **warranty period**, further reinforcing the disclaimer’s enforceability.

3. **Alignment with External Context**  
   - While the external references (e.g., *maud_898*, *maud_100*) discuss **representations and warranties** in the context of contractual conditions, they do not focus on disclaimers. However, the provided clause complements such provisions by clarifying that **implied warranties are excluded unless expressly stated otherwise** in the agreement.  

4. **Consumer Rights Preservation**  
   - The clause notes that customers retain **specific legal rights** under applicable laws, ensuring the disclaimer does not override mandatory statutory protections.  

### Why This Clause Fits the Query:
- It is a **comprehensive disclaimer** targeting implied warranties, which the query specifically mentions.  
- It addresses **legal variability** (e.g., jurisdictions where implied warranties cannot be fully excluded).  
- It mirrors standard contract practices seen in the external snippets (e.g., carve-outs for express warranties) while adding specificity to implied terms.  

### Suggested Refinement (if needed):  
If the query seeks to **link the disclaimer to broader warranty representations** (like those in the external snippets), the clause could reference:  
> *""Except as expressly set forth in [Section X], all other warranties, whether express or implied, are hereby disclaimed...""*  

This would harmonize with the conditional language in *maud_898* and *maud_100*.  

**Conclusion:** The clause fully answers the query by providing a robust, legally nuanced disclaimer of implied warranties, with safeguards for jurisdictional limitations.",5

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTION 12, THE PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.","The provided **""Disclaimers"" clause (Section 15)** is directly responsive to the query, as it explicitly disclaims both **express and implied warranties**, including the implied warranties of **merchantability** and **fitness for a particular purpose**. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause states that **all warranties** (unless expressly stated elsewhere, such as in Section 12) are disclaimed, **including implied warranties**.  
   - This is critical because implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a purpose) are automatically imposed by law unless explicitly disclaimed. The clause effectively negates these unless an exception applies.

2. **Specific Mention of UCC-Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly names two key implied warranties under the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)**:  
     - **Merchantability** (goods must be reasonably fit for ordinary use).  
     - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (if the seller knows a buyer relies on goods for a specific need).  
   - By disclaiming these, the parties limit liability for failures not covered by express warranties.

3. **Carve-Out for Express Warranties**  
   - The disclaimer is **not absolute**—it preserves warranties **expressly stated in Section 12** (or other agreed terms). This ensures the disclaimer complies with contract law, which often voids blanket disclaimers that conflict with express promises.

### Comparison to External Context:
While the external excerpts discuss **enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctive relief for breaches), the **""Disclaimers"" clause** serves a different but complementary purpose:  
- It **limits the scope of legal guarantees** (warranties) to only those explicitly stated, reducing potential liability.  
- This aligns with broader contract risk allocation, where parties often pair **disclaimers** with **remedies clauses** (like those in the external examples) to define both obligations and consequences.

### Why This Matters:
- **Legal Compliance**: Under the UCC (§ 2-316), disclaimers of implied warranties must be **conspicuous** (e.g., capitalized) and specific—this clause meets that standard.  
- **Risk Allocation**: It shifts risk to the counterparty for issues not covered by express warranties, protecting the disclaiming party from unforeseen claims.  

In summary, the clause directly addresses the query by **disclaiming implied warranties** while preserving express guarantees, a common and enforceable practice in contracts.",5
warranty disclaimer clause that includes implied warranties,cad9ed40ac,"DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.","The **warranty disclaimer clause** you provided is directly relevant to the query as it explicitly addresses both **express and implied warranties**, which is the focus of the request. Here’s how it aligns with the query and external context:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause disclaims **all implied warranties**, including but not limited to:  
     - **Merchantability** (implied warranty that goods are fit for ordinary use).  
     - **Fitness for a particular purpose** (implied warranty that goods meet a buyer’s specific needs).  
     - **Non-infringement** (implied warranty that goods do not violate third-party rights).  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on addressing implied warranties in a disclaimer.

2. **Carve-Out for Express Warranties**:  
   - The clause preserves **only those warranties ""expressly set forth in this Agreement""**, meaning any guarantees explicitly stated elsewhere in the contract remain valid.  
   - This mirrors the external examples (e.g., *maud_100* and *maud_898*), where representations/warranties are qualified by specific sections of the agreement.

3. **Broad Disclaimer Language**:  
   - The phrase *""of any kind, either express or implied""* ensures the disclaimer is comprehensive, covering all unstated warranties.  
   - This is typical in contracts to limit liability beyond agreed-upon terms, as seen in the external snippets where warranties are tied to precise conditions.

### Relevance to External Context:  
The external examples highlight how warranties are often:  
- **Conditional**: Only certain sections of the agreement (e.g., ""clause (i) or (ii)"") may survive scrutiny.  
- **Time-Bound**: Warranties must be true as of a specific event (e.g., ""Expiration Time"" or ""consummation of the Offer"").  

Your clause complements this by:  
- Clarifying that **no other warranties exist** unless explicitly stated.  
- Reinforcing that implied warranties (common law or statutory) are excluded unless the contract overrides them.  

### Why This Matters:  
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause shifts risk to the counterparty by disclaiming protections not negotiated in the contract.  
- **Legal Compliance**: It ensures compliance with laws like the UCC (U.S.) or similar regimes, which recognize implied warranties unless validly disclaimed.  

In summary, your clause is a **standard but critical disclaimer** that narrows warranties to the contract’s express terms, aligning with the query’s focus on implied warranties and the conditional approach seen in the external examples.",5
warranty disclaimer clause that includes implied warranties,b941a040b7,"7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. EACH PARTY PROVIDES ALL MATERIALS AND SERVICES TO THE OTHER PARTY ""AS IS."" EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY ANDFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each party acknowledges that it has not entered into this Agreement in reliance upon any warranty or representation except those specifically set forth herein.","The **""Disclaimer of Warranties"" clause** you provided is directly relevant to your query about a warranty disclaimer that includes implied warranties. Here's how it addresses your request:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **""AS IS"" Provision**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that all materials and services are provided **""AS IS""**, which is a standard legal formulation to disclaim warranties unless expressly stated otherwise.

2. **Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause **expressly disclaims all implied warranties**, including:  
     - **Title** (ensuring ownership rights are valid)  
     - **Non-infringement** (ensuring no violation of third-party rights)  
     - **Merchantability** (ensuring goods/services are fit for ordinary use)  
     - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (ensuring suitability for a specific need).  
   - This aligns with your request for a clause covering implied warranties.

3. **Exclusion of Reliance on Extraneous Representations**:  
   - The clause clarifies that neither party relies on any warranties or representations **outside those explicitly stated in the agreement**, reinforcing the disclaimer’s breadth.

### Relevance to External Information:  
While the external excerpts provided (e.g., specific performance, conditions to the offer) do not directly relate to warranty disclaimers, your clause complements such provisions by:  
- **Limiting liability** for breaches of implied warranties, which could otherwise trigger remedies like specific performance (mentioned in *maud_199*).  
- Supporting the **""true and correct"" representations** framework (from *maud_898*) by clarifying that only **express warranties** in the agreement apply.  

### Why This Works for Your Query:  
The clause is a **comprehensive disclaimer** that:  
- Covers **all implied warranties** (per your focus).  
- Uses **standard legal language** (""AS IS,"" statutory terms like ""merchantability"").  
- Prevents unintended reliance on oral or external assurances.

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The provided **warranty disclaimer clause** directly addresses the query by explicitly disclaiming both **implied warranties of merchantability** and **fitness for a particular purpose**, along with other non-express warranties. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

1. **Disclaiming Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause states that the **only warranties** applicable are those **expressly set forth in the agreement**.  
   - It then **explicitly disclaims all other warranties**, including **implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) and **statutory warranties**, unless expressly stated otherwise.  

2. **Specific Mention of Key Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause **calls out** the two most common implied warranties under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) and common law:  
     - **Merchantability** (a guarantee that goods are reasonably fit for ordinary use).  
     - **Fitness for a particular purpose** (a guarantee that goods are suitable for a specific use if the seller was aware of that use).  

3. **Broad Exclusion of Non-Express Warranties**:  
   - The disclaimer is **comprehensive**, covering **all implied and statutory warranties** unless explicitly stated in the agreement.  
   - It also clarifies that **non-infringement warranties** (unless expressly included) are disclaimed, further limiting liability.  

### **Relevance to External Information**  
While the external references discuss **conditions to representations and warranties**, they do not directly address **implied warranty disclaimers**. However, the clause in question **complements** such provisions by ensuring that:  
- Only **express warranties** in the agreement are enforceable.  
- No **additional protections** (like implied warranties) apply unless explicitly stated.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **highly relevant** to the query because it:  
✔ **Explicitly disclaims implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.**  
✔ **Limits warranties strictly to those stated in the agreement.**  
✔ **Provides legal clarity** to prevent unintended warranty claims.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause states that **neither party makes any warranties** beyond those **expressly stated in the agreement**. This includes a blanket disclaimer of all implied warranties, specifically naming:  
     - **Merchantability** (a warranty that goods/services are reasonably fit for ordinary use).  
     - **Fitness for a particular purpose** (a warranty that goods/services will meet a specific need disclosed by one party to the other).  

2. **Additional Disclaimers**:  
   - The clause further disclaims warranties arising from:  
     - **Course of dealing** (past interactions between the parties).  
     - **Course of performance** (how the parties execute the contract).  
     - **Industry usage** (common practices in the relevant trade).  

3. **Alignment with Query**:  
   - The query sought a warranty disclaimer addressing implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The clause explicitly covers both, using standard legal language to negate these UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) or common law warranties.  

4. **Contrast with External Information**:  
   - The external excerpts discuss **conditions to an offer** and the **accuracy of representations/warranties** at specific times (e.g., Expiration Time). These are unrelated to the disclaimer clause, which focuses on **limiting liability** by excluding implied warranties.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause satisfies the query by clearly disclaiming the two requested implied warranties while reinforcing the parties’ intent to limit obligations to **express terms only**. This is a standard practice in contracts to avoid unintended liabilities.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

1. **Explicit Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   The clause explicitly disclaims ""all other warranties and representations, whether express or implied,"" which includes the two key implied warranties sought in the query:  
   - **Merchantability**: The clause specifically mentions the disclaimer of ""implied warranties of merchantability,"" which assures that goods are reasonably fit for their ordinary purpose.  
   - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose**: It also disclaims ""fitness for a particular purpose,"" which covers situations where a seller knows a buyer is relying on the goods for a specific use.  

2. **Broad Coverage**:  
   The disclaimer is comprehensive, extending to other implied warranties (e.g., those arising from ""course of dealing or usage of trade"") and emphasizes compliance with applicable law (""to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law""). This ensures enforceability while maximizing protection for the disclaiming party (Accuray).  

3. **Relevance to External Context**:  
   While the external information provided discusses conditions to an offer and representations/warranties, it does not directly address disclaimer clauses. However, the clause you provided contrasts with those examples by actively negating warranties rather than affirming their accuracy. This distinction is critical in contracts where one party seeks to limit liability.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause meets the query’s requirements by clearly and broadly disclaiming the two implied warranties (merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose) while adhering to legal enforceability standards. It serves as a robust risk-allocation tool in agreements.

warranty disclaimer clause that disclaims implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose,cad9ed40ac,"DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.","The provided **warranty disclaimer clause** directly addresses the query by explicitly disclaiming **implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose**, which are the two key types of implied warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and common law. Here’s how the clause aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Disclaiming Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause states that **no warranties are made except those expressly set forth in the agreement**, thereby excluding all implied warranties unless explicitly stated otherwise.  
   - It specifically names the **implied warranty of merchantability** (a guarantee that goods are reasonably fit for ordinary use) and the **implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose** (a guarantee that goods are suitable for a buyer’s specific needs if the seller was aware of those needs).  

2. **Legal Compliance**  
   - Under the UCC (§ 2-316), disclaimers of implied warranties must be **conspicuous** (e.g., capitalized or bolded) and may require specific language (e.g., ""merchantability"" must be mentioned). This clause meets those requirements by:  
     - Using **ALL CAPS** for prominence.  
     - Explicitly naming **merchantability** and **fitness for a particular purpose**.  

3. **Scope of Disclaimer**  
   - The clause applies to **both parties**, meaning neither can claim reliance on unwritten assurances about the quality or suitability of the subject matter (e.g., goods/services).  
   - It also includes a catch-all for **non-infringement**, broadening the disclaimer’s coverage.  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts discuss **conditions to representations and warranties** in an agreement, they do not directly address disclaimers. However, they highlight that warranties are typically **limited to what is expressly stated** in the contract, reinforcing the purpose of the disclaimer clause—to negate any unwritten assurances.  

### Why This Matters:  
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause shifts risk to the counterparty by preventing claims like ""the product wasn’t fit for my needs"" unless such a warranty was explicitly agreed to.  
- **Enforceability**: Properly drafted disclaimers (like this one) are more likely to be upheld in court.  

In summary, this clause **fully satisfies the query** by clearly and legally disclaiming the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, while complying with standard contractual best practices.",5

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTION 12, THE PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.","The provided **""Disclaimers"" clause (Section 15)** directly addresses the query by explicitly disclaiming implied warranties of **merchantability** and **fitness for a particular purpose**, which are the two key implied warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and common law. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

1. **Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause states that **all warranties not expressly stated in Section 12** (presumably where limited express warranties are outlined) are disclaimed.  
   - It specifically calls out the exclusion of **implied warranties of merchantability** (a guarantee that goods are reasonably fit for ordinary use) and **fitness for a particular purpose** (a guarantee that goods meet a buyer’s specialized needs if the seller was aware of those needs).  

2. **Scope and Clarity**:  
   - The disclaimer is broad (""ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED"") but carves out exceptions only for what is expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., Section 12).  
   - The language (""INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION"") ensures that the disclaimer is interpreted expansively to cover all implied warranties, not just the two named examples.  

3. **Legal Enforceability**:  
   - The clause follows conventional drafting practices for warranty disclaimers, using **conspicuous capitalization** (as required by the UCC for disclaimers of implied warranties) to ensure enforceability.  
   - By disclaiming these warranties, the clause limits the seller’s liability and shifts risk to the buyer, which is a common objective in commercial contracts.  

### Relevance to External Information:  
While the external excerpts (Sections 10.12 and 11.13) discuss **specific performance** and **jurisdiction** for breaches, they do not directly relate to warranty disclaimers. However, they highlight the agreement’s emphasis on **limiting remedies** (e.g., injunctive relief without proof of damages), which complements the disclaimer clause by further restricting liability.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause satisfies the query by clearly and prominently disclaiming the two implied warranties of **merchantability** and **fitness for a particular purpose**, thereby protecting the parties (typically the seller) from unintended warranty claims beyond the agreed terms.",5

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.","The clause you provided is a standard **disclaimer of implied warranties**, which is directly relevant to your query about the **waiver of implied warranty of title and non-infringement**. Here’s how it applies:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly states that **no implied warranties** are made by either party unless expressly stated in the agreement.  
   - This includes, but is not limited to, implied warranties of:  
     - **Merchantability** (fitness for ordinary use)  
     - **Fitness for a particular purpose**  
     - **Non-infringement** (which is part of your query)  

2. **Relevance to ""Warranty of Title""**  
   - While the clause does not **explicitly** mention ""warranty of title,"" the broad language (""**any warranty of any kind, express or implied**"") suggests that **implied warranties of title** (which assure the buyer that the seller has legal ownership and the right to transfer goods/property) are also likely disclaimed unless expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement.  

3. **Relevance to ""Non-Infringement""**  
   - The clause **explicitly disclaims** the implied warranty of **non-infringement**, meaning neither party guarantees that the goods/services provided will not violate third-party intellectual property rights unless specifically stated otherwise in the agreement.  

### Connection to External References:
- The external references discuss **conditions where representations and warranties must be true** for an offer to proceed.  
- Your clause, however, **limits warranties** to only those **expressly stated** in the agreement, meaning any **implied warranties (including title and non-infringement)** are waived unless explicitly included elsewhere.  

### Practical Effect:
- If a dispute arises over **title defects** or **IP infringement**, the buyer may have **no recourse** unless the agreement includes an **express warranty** covering these issues.  
- This shifts risk to the buyer, who must conduct their own due diligence or negotiate specific protections.  

### Recommendation:
If the parties intend to **preserve** any implied warranties (e.g., title or non-infringement), the agreement should **explicitly state** those exceptions to this disclaimer. Otherwise, courts will likely enforce the waiver as written.

### 1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
The clause explicitly states that **all other warranties are excluded**, whether express or implied, unless otherwise stated in the agreement. This includes:  
   - **Implied warranty of title** (not explicitly mentioned but covered under ""all other terms... are excluded"").  
   - **Implied warranty of non-infringement** (explicitly mentioned as ""warranties... against infringement"").  

   By doing so, the clause effectively **waives** these implied warranties unless they are expressly provided elsewhere in the agreement.

### 2. **Limitation to Maximum Extent Permitted by Law**  
The clause begins with **""To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,""** which means that if local law prohibits the complete exclusion of certain implied warranties (e.g., under the UCC in the U.S., some warranties cannot be fully disclaimed), the clause still enforces the waiver as far as legally possible.

### 3. **Exclusive Warranty Provision**  
The clause clarifies that the **only warranties applicable** are those explicitly stated in the agreement (""the foregoing Warranty is exclusive""). This reinforces that no other warranties—including implied warranties of title or non-infringement—apply unless specifically included elsewhere.

### 4. **Relevance to External Information**  
- The first external reference (maud_898) discusses **representations and warranties being true at consummation**, but your clause goes further by **excluding all other warranties not explicitly stated**.  
- The second reference (maud_417) deals with **enforcement and remedies**, but your clause limits the scope of warranties, which in turn affects available remedies (e.g., no claim for breach of implied warranties if they are waived).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is a **broad disclaimer** that:  
- **Excludes implied warranties of title and non-infringement** unless expressly stated otherwise.  
- **Limits liability** by making the stated warranties the sole basis for claims.  
- **Complies with legal limits** on disclaimers while maximizing protection for the warranting party.

### 1. **Explicit Waiver of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause states that **""Distributor waives all representations, conditions and warranties (whether express, implied, or statutory)""**, which includes the **implied warranty of title** (ownership rights) and **non-infringement** (assurance that goods do not violate third-party IP rights).  
   - By waiving these implied warranties, Cisco disclaims any legal obligation to guarantee that its products are free from ownership disputes or IP infringement claims unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### 2. **Specific Disclaimer of Title and Non-Infringement Representations**  
   - The clause explicitly clarifies:  
     > *""NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS SECTION 10, CISCO MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, OR AS TO INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION THEREOF.""*  
   - This reinforces that Cisco provides **no assurances** regarding:  
     - **Title (ownership)** – No guarantee that Cisco has clear legal title to the products/IP.  
     - **Non-infringement** – No promise that the products won’t violate third-party IP rights.  

### 3. **Limited Remedies for Infringement Claims**  
   - The clause directs the Distributor to **Section 15** for remedies related to IP infringement, implying that:  
     - The waiver of implied warranties shifts liability risks to the Distributor.  
     - Any recourse for infringement is **contractually limited** (e.g., indemnification or repair/replacement) rather than arising from implied warranties.  

### 4. **Alignment with External Context (Enforcement & Remedies)**  
   - The external references highlight that parties may seek **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions)** for breaches, but the disclaimer here **narrows the scope** of such remedies by excluding claims based on implied warranties.  
   - The Distributor’s acceptance of this waiver means it cannot later claim breach of implied warranties of title/non-infringement unless expressly preserved elsewhere.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause **actively disclaims and waives** implied warranties of title and non-infringement, shifting risk to the Distributor and limiting Cisco’s liability. It aligns with broader contract principles where parties may exclude implied warranties to allocate risk explicitly.

Here’s how it relates:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **all implied warranties**, including:  
     - **Noninfringement** (directly relevant to the query)  
     - Merchantability  
     - Fitness for a particular purpose  
     - Warranties arising from trade practice or law  
   - This means the seller (Cisco) is not guaranteeing that the product does not infringe third-party rights (e.g., patents, copyrights).  

2. **Waiver of Implied Warranty of Title**  
   - While the clause does not **explicitly** mention ""warranty of title,"" the broad language (""all express or implied conditions, representations, and warranties"") could be interpreted to exclude it, depending on jurisdiction.  
   - Some jurisdictions (e.g., under the UCC in the U.S.) require **explicit** language to disclaim the implied warranty of title, so this clause may not fully waive it unless further specified.  

3. **Limitations on Disclaimers**  
   - The clause acknowledges that some jurisdictions restrict the exclusion of implied warranties (e.g., consumer protection laws).  
   - If an implied warranty (like noninfringement) cannot be fully excluded, the clause limits its duration to the **express warranty period**.  

### Connection to External Information:  
The external excerpts discuss **conditions where representations/warranties must remain true** at closing. While they don’t directly address disclaimers, they highlight that:  
- Some warranties (e.g., fundamental reps) may survive despite general disclaimers.  
- The clause here contrasts with those terms by **broadly disclaiming** most implied warranties unless legally unenforceable.  

### Practical Implications:  
- A buyer relying on this agreement would have **no recourse** for infringement claims (unless an express warranty covers it).  
- If **title disputes** arise, the buyer may argue the disclaimer was insufficient (if jurisdiction requires explicit waiver of title warranties).  

### Suggested Refinement for Clarity:  
To explicitly waive the **implied warranty of title**, the clause could add:  
> *""including, without limitation, any implied warranty of title or noninfringement.""*  

This would remove ambiguity in jurisdictions requiring clear disclaimers for title.  

**Conclusion:** The clause is highly relevant to the query as it disclaims implied warranties (including noninfringement) but may need strengthening for title warranties depending on governing law.",5

respect to such Products.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query about the **""waiver of implied warranty of title and non-infringement""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Explicit Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause states:  
     > *""Seller makes no other warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of any intellectual property right of any third party...""*  
   - This explicitly disclaims **implied warranties**, including:  
     - **Implied warranty of non-infringement** (intellectual property rights).  
     - **Implied warranty of merchantability** (fitness for ordinary use).  
     - **Implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose**.  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention the **implied warranty of title** (which ensures the seller has legal ownership and right to sell the goods), the broad language (*""no other warranty of any kind, express or implied""*) could be interpreted to waive this as well, unless otherwise required by law.  

### 2. **Waiver of Claims Related to Non-Infringement & Quality**  
   - The clause requires the buyer to inspect and notify the seller of any defects (including infringement claims) within **30 days** (or as required by law).  
   - Failure to notify constitutes a **waiver of all claims**, which would include claims based on:  
     - **Infringement** (if the product violates third-party IP rights).  
     - **Title defects** (if the seller lacked proper ownership rights).  
   - This reinforces the waiver of implied warranties by shifting responsibility to the buyer for timely action.  

### 3. **Comparison with External References**  
   - The external references discuss **conditions where certain warranties must remain true** (e.g., representations in an acquisition agreement).  
   - In contrast, your clause **actively disclaims warranties**, making it a stronger waiver than the conditional language in the external examples.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause **waives implied warranties** (including non-infringement and potentially title) and **shifts liability to the buyer** through strict notice requirements. If the buyer fails to inspect and report issues, they lose the right to claim breach of warranty—whether express, implied, or statutory (where permitted by law).

### Analysis of the Clause:  
The provided disclaimer states:  
> *""EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.""*  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **General Disclaimer of Warranties** – The clause broadly disclaims all implied warranties **except** those expressly stated in the agreement.  
2. **Non-Infringement Warranty Mentioned** – Unlike the query's concern, this clause **does** explicitly disclaim the implied warranty of **non-infringement** (alongside merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose).  
3. **No Mention of Title Warranty** – While it disclaims non-infringement, it **does not** explicitly disclaim the implied warranty of **title** (which ensures the seller has legal rights to transfer ownership).  

### Conclusion:  
The clause is **partially relevant** to the query because:  
- It **does waive non-infringement warranties** (contrary to the query's condition).  
- It **does not waive title warranties** (aligned with the query).  

If the intent is to **preserve non-infringement warranties**, this clause would need modification to exclude non-infringement from the disclaimer. If the intent is only to **preserve title warranties**, this clause already does so by omission.

The provided clause is a **broad disclaimer** that excludes most implied and statutory warranties but has a nuanced approach to **non-infringement warranties**.

### Relevance to the Query:
1. **General Disclaimer of Warranties**  
   - The clause states that **only the express warranties in the agreement apply**, and all other warranties (implied or statutory) are disclaimed.  
   - This includes disclaiming **implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose**, which are standard exclusions.  

2. **Treatment of Non-Infringement Warranties**  
   - The clause **explicitly disclaims** any warranties of non-infringement **that are not expressly stated in the agreement**.  
   - This means that if the agreement **does not include an express non-infringement warranty**, then none exists.  
   - However, if the agreement **does include an express non-infringement warranty**, it remains intact.  

3. **No Mention of Title Warranties**  
   - The clause **does not explicitly disclaim warranties of title** (unlike non-infringement).  
   - Under the **UCC (Uniform Commercial Code)**, unless excluded, an implied warranty of title typically exists in sales contracts.  
   - Since the disclaimer does **not** mention title, a court might still imply such a warranty unless another provision excludes it.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause is relevant because it:  
- **Disclaims all implied warranties except those expressly stated** (including non-infringement, unless expressly given).  
- **Does not explicitly disclaim title warranties**, meaning they might still apply by default.  
- Aligns with the query’s focus on a disclaimer that **does not waive title warranties** while addressing non-infringement in a conditional manner.  

### External Information Context:  
The external clauses (from MAUD) discuss **conditions where representations/warranties must remain true** at closing. While not directly on point, they reinforce that:  
- Some warranties (unless specifically excluded) may survive.  
- The disclaimer here ensures that **only the agreed express warranties apply**, which is consistent with contractual risk allocation.

   - However, it does **not explicitly waive title warranties** (i.e., warranties related to ownership of goods or intellectual property).  

2. **Specific Exclusion of Ownership & Non-Infringement Warranties**:  
   - The clause **explicitly states** that Cisco makes **no representation or warranty as to ownership of intellectual property or proprietary rights**, nor as to **infringement or misappropriation**.  
   - This means that while the disclaimer includes a general waiver of non-infringement warranties, it **does not waive title warranties** (ownership rights) in an absolute sense—instead, it clarifies that no such warranties are made at all.  

3. **Remedies for Infringement**:  
   - The clause directs any claims related to infringement or misappropriation to **Section 15 (""Patent and Copyright Infringement"")**, suggesting that while warranties are disclaimed, remedies for actual infringement are addressed separately.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **does not waive title warranties** (as it does not explicitly state that Distributor waives claims related to ownership).  
- It **disclaims non-infringement warranties** but does so in a way that shifts enforcement to a separate section rather than a blanket waiver.

   - The clause states:  
     *""Each Party disclaims all warranties... including without limitation the implied warranties of **title, non-infringement**, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose.""*  
   - This means the clause **does waive** these warranties, contrary to the query's request for a disclaimer that **does not** waive them.  

2. **General Structure of Warranty Disclaimers**  
   - If the goal is to **exclude** title and non-infringement from the disclaimer, the clause would need to:  
     - Omit these warranties from the list (e.g., only disclaim merchantability and fitness).  
     - Explicitly state that title and non-infringement warranties **remain** (e.g., *""Except as otherwise provided, all implied warranties, other than those of title and non-infringement, are disclaimed.""*).  

3. **External Context (Optional Consideration)**  
   - The external references discuss **specific performance** and **representations/warranties** but do not directly address the disclaimer issue.  
   - If the intent is to preserve certain warranties (e.g., for IP or ownership assurances), the clause would need affirmative language to **carve out** those warranties from the disclaimer.

The provided clause (**Section 10.5 - Disclaimer of Warranties**) is relevant because:  

1. **General Disclaimer of Implied Warranties** – The clause broadly disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) except for those expressly stated in the agreement.  

2. **Partial Mention of Non-Infringement** – While the clause **does disclaim** warranties related to:  
   - *""the validity of any patents""*  
   - *""the non-infringement of any intellectual property rights of third parties""*,  
   it **does not explicitly disclaim title warranties** (i.e., warranties that the seller has valid ownership/right to transfer the goods/services).  

3. **Relevance to Query** – The clause aligns with the query because:  
   - It **does not waive title warranties** (which are often implied under the UCC or common law unless explicitly disclaimed).  
   - It **does disclaim non-infringement warranties**, but only in the context of third-party IP rights (not necessarily all infringement claims).  

### Key Takeaway:  
This disclaimer is **narrower** than a full waiver of all implied warranties (including title and non-infringement). If the parties intended to preserve title warranties while disclaiming others, this clause achieves that—but a court might still imply a title warranty unless expressly excluded.

exclusive remedy for breach of product warranty,5167d4bf26,"Your exclusive remedy, if any, under these warranties is limited, at Seller's election, to: (a) refund of Your purchase price, (b) repair by Seller or Supplier(s)of any Products or services found to be defective, or (c) replacement of any such Product or reperformance of any services.

SELLER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR SUPPLIERS’ PRODUCT OR SERVICE SPECIFICATIONS OR THE PERFORMANCE OR ADEQUACY OF ANY DESIGN OR SPECIFICATION PROVIDED TO SELLER.","The clause provided is directly relevant to the query about the **""exclusive remedy for breach of product warranty""** because it explicitly defines the limited remedies available to the buyer (referred to as ""You"") in case of a breach of warranty by the seller (""Seller""). Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Exclusive Remedy Definition**:  
   The clause states that the buyer’s **sole and exclusive remedies** for any breach of warranty are strictly limited to one of the following (at the seller’s election):
   - (a) Refund of the purchase price,  
   - (b) Repair of defective products/services, or  
   - (c) Replacement of products or reperformance of services.  
   This narrows down all potential claims or actions the buyer might otherwise have under warranty law.

2. **Exclusion of Other Remedies**:  
   The clause emphasizes that these are the **only** remedies available, excluding all other legal or equitable remedies (e.g., consequential damages, incidental damages, or claims under implied warranties like merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). This aligns with the concept of an ""exclusive remedy"" in contract law, which restricts the aggrieved party’s options.

3. **Disclaimers of Additional Warranties**:  
   The clause reinforces the exclusivity by disclaiming **all other representations or warranties**, whether express or implied (including merchantability, fitness for purpose, or noninfringement). This further limits the buyer’s recourse to only the remedies specified.

4. **""As-Is"" Provision for Non-Warranted Items**:  
   If no supplier warranty exists, the buyer accepts products/services **""as-is""**, meaning no remedies apply at all. This underscores the exclusivity of the warranty terms when they do exist.

5. **Relevance to External Context**:  
   While the external information provided discusses representations and warranties in a different contractual context (e.g., conditions to an offer), the clause here complements such provisions by clarifying the **practical consequences** of a warranty breach—limiting liability to the agreed-upon remedies.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
The clause is a classic example of a **limitation of remedies** provision in commercial contracts. It ensures predictability for both parties by capping the seller’s liability and preventing the buyer from pursuing broader legal claims. This is critical for risk allocation in transactions, especially in sales of goods governed by the UCC (U.S.) or similar frameworks, where implied warranties might otherwise expose sellers to unforeseen liabilities.

In summary, the clause directly answers the query by defining the **exclusive and exhaustive** remedies for warranty breaches, disclaiming all other rights, and shifting risk to the buyer where no warranty exists.",5
exclusive remedy for breach of product warranty,99ff232523,"8.3 Remedy. ABDC’s liability and Customer’s exclusive remedy for breach of warranties in Paragraph 3.2 will be, at ABDC’s option, to (i) repair or replace Software or hardware so it performs substantially in accordance with its documentation; (ii) advise Customer how to achieve substantially the same functionality using different procedures, or (iii) replace defective media returned within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date. Such replacement will not extend such ninety (90) day period.","The clause **""8.3 Remedy""** directly addresses the **exclusive remedy for breach of product warranty** by specifying the limited recourse available to the Customer if ABDC breaches the warranties outlined in Paragraph 3.2. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Exclusive Remedy Definition**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the listed remedies (repair, replace, or advise on alternative functionality) are the **Customer’s exclusive remedy** for breach of warranty. This means the Customer cannot pursue other legal claims (e.g., monetary damages, specific performance) unless the clause is invalidated or other rights are preserved elsewhere in the agreement.

2. **Limited Scope of Remedies**:  
   - ABDC retains the **option** to choose among three remedies:  
     (i) Repair/replacement of non-conforming software/hardware,  
     (ii) Guidance on alternative workarounds, or  
     (iii) Replacement of defective media (within 90 days).  
   - These remedies are narrowly tailored and do not include broader relief like refunds or consequential damages.

3. **Exclusivity vs. External Context**:  
   - The external references (e.g., *Section 9.10* and *Section 10.12*) discuss **cumulative remedies** and **specific performance** for breaches of other agreement terms, but **8.3 Remedy** carves out an exception by limiting the Customer’s recourse for warranty breaches to the specified options.  
   - The phrase *""exclusive remedy""* in 8.3 contrasts with the *""cumulative remedies""* language in the external sections, emphasizing that warranty breaches are treated distinctly.

4. **Time-Bound Condition**:  
   - The 90-day limit for media replacement reinforces the restrictive nature of the remedy, further narrowing the Customer’s options.

### Practical Implications:
- The clause protects ABDC from expansive liability by capping remedies for warranty breaches.  
- Customers must accept the prescribed remedies unless they can prove the remedies fail their essential purpose (a potential argument under the UCC or similar laws).  
- The external sections on specific performance (e.g., for merger obligations) do not override this clause, as 8.3 is explicitly limited to warranty breaches under Paragraph 3.2.

In summary, **8.3 Remedy** is the contractual answer to the query: it defines the sole actions a Customer can take for warranty breaches, excluding other legal or equitable remedies unless the agreement expressly allows them elsewhere.",5

(e) The remedies set forth in this Section 7 are exclusive, and no other remedy or remedies are available to Buyer, whether in law or equity. Buyer and Seller agree that the remedies contained herein are adequate remedies.","The clause **""LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTY AND LIABILITY""** (specifically subsections (d) and (e)) is directly relevant to the query about the **""exclusive remedy for breach of product warranty""** in the following ways:

### **1. Exclusive Remedy Defined (Subsection (e))**  
- The clause explicitly states that the remedies provided in **Section 7** (presumably covering warranty claims) are the **only** remedies available to the Buyer for any breach, whether under contract, tort, or equity.  
- This means the Buyer **cannot** seek additional damages (such as consequential, punitive, or indirect damages) beyond what is specified in the agreement.  

### **2. Monetary Cap on Liability (Subsection (d))**  
- The Seller’s maximum liability for **any claim** (including breach of warranty) is limited to the **invoice price of the Product(s)** involved.  
- This reinforces the exclusivity of the remedy by capping damages, preventing the Buyer from recovering anything beyond this amount.  

### **3. Waiver of Other Remedies**  
- The clause explicitly **excludes** liability for **consequential, indirect, punitive, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption).  
- It also clarifies that **no other legal or equitable remedies** (such as injunctive relief or specific performance) are available, unless explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement.  

### **Comparison with External References**  
The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 10.12*) discuss situations where **equitable remedies (injunction, specific performance)** are available because monetary damages would be inadequate. However, the provided clause **contractually excludes such remedies** unless expressly preserved elsewhere.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **strictly limits** the Buyer’s recourse for a breach of warranty to:  
1. **A refund or replacement** (implied by ""invoice price"" as the cap).  
2. **No additional damages** (consequential, punitive, etc.).  
3. **No equitable remedies** unless the contract explicitly allows them.  

Thus, it enforces an **exclusive remedy structure**, preventing the Buyer from pursuing broader legal claims beyond the agreed contractual terms.

   - All other **express or implied warranties** (including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose) are **expressly disclaimed**.  

2. **Exclusive Remedy for Breach of Warranty**:  
   - If the Products **fail to meet the Specifications**, the **sole and exclusive remedy** available to the Buyer is:  
     - **Replacement** of the non-conforming Products with conforming ones, **at Seller’s sole expense**.  
   - This means the Buyer **cannot** seek other remedies (e.g., damages, refunds, or compensation for losses) unless otherwise provided by law.  

3. **Exclusion of Consequential and Incidental Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly **disclaims liability** for **consequential, incidental, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, or business interruption).  
   - This reinforces that **replacement** is the **only remedy** for a breach of warranty.  

### **Relevance to External Information**  
While the external references discuss **representations and warranties** in a different contractual context (e.g., M&A agreements), they do not directly address **product warranties** or **exclusive remedies**. However, they highlight the importance of:  
- **Conditions for enforceability** (e.g., warranties being ""true and correct"" at closing).  
- **Specificity in warranty claims** (e.g., identifying which warranties apply).  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause clearly defines:  
- The **limited scope** of the warranty (only compliance with Specifications).  
- The **exclusive remedy** (replacement, not damages).  
- The **disclaimer of all other remedies and liabilities**.  

This ensures that the Buyer’s recourse is strictly confined to **replacement**, preventing broader claims for breach of warranty.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusive Remedies for Defects**:
   - The clause repeatedly states that **repair, replacement, or a pro-rated refund** (for products) constitutes the **sole and exclusive remedy** for defective products, software, or legally required safety updates. This aligns with the query by clearly limiting the customer’s recourse for warranty breaches to these specific actions.

2. **Exclusion of Additional Damages**:
   - The clause explicitly disclaims liability for **special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or tort damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) arising from the agreement, except in narrowly defined exceptions (e.g., unauthorized IP use, intentional misconduct, or violations of mandatory law). This reinforces the exclusivity of the remedy by barring other claims.

3. **Limitation of Liability**:
   - The total aggregate liability for breaches (outside the exceptions) is **capped** at the purchase price paid for products in the 12 months preceding the claim. This further narrows the scope of potential remedies.

4. **Exceptions to Exclusivity**:
   - The exclusive remedy does not apply to:
     - **Strict product liability** under mandatory law (e.g., consumer protection statutes).
     - Breaches involving **unauthorized IP use** or **willful misconduct**.
     - Obligations under confidentiality agreements or Section 10 (unspecified but likely critical provisions).
   - These carve-outs ensure compliance with non-waivable legal rights while maintaining exclusivity for standard warranty claims.

### Connection to External Information:
The external excerpts emphasize that:
- Equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) may be available for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate (e.g., in merger agreements).  
- However, **this clause contrasts with those examples** by contractually limiting remedies to repair/replacement/refund and excluding equitable relief for standard warranty breaches, unless an exception applies.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
The clause answers the query by:
- Defining the **exclusive remedies** (repair, replace, refund) for product warranty breaches.
- Explicitly **excluding broader remedies** (e.g., consequential damages) unless exceptional circumstances exist.
- Balancing exclusivity with **mandatory legal requirements** (e.g., strict liability laws).

In summary, the clause is a **classic limitation of liability and exclusive remedy provision**, prioritizing predictability and risk allocation in commercial transactions while respecting non-waivable legal protections.",5
"product replacement, repair or refund as exclusivity remedy",5167d4bf26,"Your exclusive remedy, if any, under these warranties is limited, at Seller's election, to: (a) refund of Your purchase price, (b) repair by Seller or Supplier(s)of any Products or services found to be defective, or (c) replacement of any such Product or reperformance of any services. If there is no Supplier warranty, You take all such Products and services “as-is” without any warranty. You acknowledge that except as specifically set forth herein, THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND BY SELLER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THEIR MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR OTHERWISE. SELLER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR SUPPLIERS’ PRODUCT OR SERVICE SPECIFICATIONS OR THE PERFORMANCE OR ADEQUACY OF ANY DESIGN OR SPECIFICATION PROVIDED TO SELLER.","The clause is directly relevant to the query about **""product replacement, repair, or refund as exclusivity remedy""** because it explicitly defines the limited and exclusive remedies available to the buyer (referred to as ""You"") in case of defective products or services under the seller's warranties. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

1. **Exclusive Remedies**:  
   The clause states that the buyer’s **sole and exclusive remedies** for breach of warranty are limited to:  
   - (a) **Refund** of the purchase price,  
   - (b) **Repair** of defective products/services by the seller or supplier, or  
   - (c) **Replacement** of the product or reperformance of services.  
   This directly addresses the query by confirming that these are the **only** options available to the buyer, at the seller’s discretion.

2. **""As-Is"" Basis for Non-Warranted Items**:  
   If there is no supplier warranty, the buyer accepts products/services **""as-is""** without any warranties, reinforcing that the remedies above are the **exclusive** recourse.

3. **Disclaimer of Other Warranties**:  
   The clause explicitly disclaims all other representations or warranties (express or implied), including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement. This reinforces that the listed remedies (refund, repair, replacement) are the **exclusive** legal recourse, barring any other claims.

4. **Relevance to External Information**:  
   While the external excerpts discuss **representations and warranties** in a broader contractual context (e.g., conditions for an offer), the clause here narrows the focus to **warranty remedies** for defective products/services. It complements the external information by specifying the **practical consequences** if warranties are breached (i.e., the limited remedies available).  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause answers the query by clearly defining the **exclusive and limited nature** of the buyer’s remedies (refund, repair, or replacement) and eliminating any other implied warranties or liabilities. This aligns with the query’s focus on exclusivity in contractual remedies.",5
"product replacement, repair or refund as exclusivity remedy",926f3c66d7,"THE SOLE REMEDY UNDER THIS WARRANTY SHALL BE THE REPAIR,
REPLACEMENT OR CREDIT FOR DEFECTIVE PARTS AS STATED ABOVE. THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ANY
OTHER WARRANTIES EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
COMPLIANCE WITH ROHS AND WEEE (AND SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES), AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.","The clause you provided establishes **product replacement, repair, or refund (credit) as the exclusive remedies** for defects under the warranty, which directly addresses your query about exclusivity of remedies. Here’s how it aligns with the query and external context:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Exclusive Remedies**: The clause explicitly states that the **sole remedies** for defective parts are limited to repair, replacement, or credit. This excludes all other potential remedies (e.g., monetary damages, rescission, or equitable relief like injunctions or specific performance).  
   - *Relevance to Query*: It confirms that the parties agreed to limit remedies to these three options, making them exclusive unless otherwise mandated by law.

2. **Exclusion of Other Warranties**: The clause disclaims all other warranties (express or implied), including merchantability, fitness for purpose, and compliance with regulatory standards (e.g., RoHS/WEEE).  
   - *Relevance*: This reinforces the exclusivity by clarifying that no other claims (e.g., breach of implied warranties) can trigger additional remedies beyond repair/replacement/credit.

3. **Contrast with External Context**:  
   - The external excerpts (e.g., *Maud_417* and *Maud_102*) discuss **non-exclusive remedies**, where parties retain rights to equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) alongside legal remedies. Your clause does the opposite—it **contractually excludes** such alternatives.  
   - The external clauses emphasize scenarios where monetary damages are inadequate (e.g., mergers), while your clause treats repair/replacement/credit as adequate and sufficient.

### Legal Implications:
- **Enforceability**: Courts generally uphold exclusive remedy clauses unless they fail their essential purpose (e.g., if repair/replacement is repeatedly unsuccessful) or violate public policy.  
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause shifts risk to the buyer by limiting recourse, which is common in commercial contracts for goods.  

### Practical Advice:
If the query seeks to **challenge** the exclusivity, one might argue:  
- The clause could be unenforceable if the remedies fail to resolve the defect (UCC § 2-719).  
- Consumer protection laws (e.g., in the EU or under the UCC for consumers) may override such limitations.  

If the goal is to **draft** such a clause, ensure it complies with applicable law and includes carve-outs for statutory rights.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Exclusive Remedy for Defective/Nonconforming Products**  
   - The clause states that if the Product is defective or nonconforming, the Seller's obligation is limited to either:  
     - **Replacing the Product** without additional charge, **or**  
     - **Refunding the purchase price** upon return of the Product (at Seller's expense).  
   - Critically, it specifies that **this refund or replacement is the Buyer's ""sole and exclusive remedy""** for such defects. This means the Buyer cannot seek additional damages (e.g., compensation for lost profits or other losses) beyond these two options.

### 2. **Limitation of Liability**  
   - The clause further reinforces the exclusivity of the remedy by capping the Seller’s total liability to **the purchase price of the Product** in question, regardless of the legal theory (contract, negligence, warranty, etc.).  
   - It explicitly excludes liability for **special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages** (e.g., business interruption, lost profits, or punitive damages).  

### 3. **Conditions for Claims**  
   - The Buyer must inspect the Product promptly and notify the Seller of defects within **10 days** (for damage/shortages) or **150 days** (for all other claims). Failure to do so results in an unconditional waiver of claims.  
   - This tight timeline ensures that remedies like replacement or refund are the only recourse if the Buyer acts within the stipulated period.  

### 4. **Alignment with the Query**  
   - The clause directly addresses the query by establishing that **replacement or refund is the exclusive remedy** for defective/nonconforming products, with no alternative options (e.g., repair is not mentioned, only replacement/refund).  
   - It also clarifies that this exclusivity applies **regardless of the legal basis** (contract, tort, warranty), which aligns with the query’s focus on remedy exclusivity.  

### Comparison to External Information  
While the external excerpts discuss conditions for tender offers in mergers (unrelated to product liability), your clause is a **standard limitation of liability and remedy provision** in commercial sales contracts. It prioritizes predictability for the Seller by strictly limiting recourse to replacement/refund and excluding broader damages.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause is a strong example of a **""limitation of remedies""** provision, where the parties agree upfront that certain remedies (here, replacement or refund) are the **only available options**, overriding other potential legal claims. This protects the Seller from open-ended liability while giving the Buyer a clear (but narrow) path for redress.

"product replacement, repair or refund as exclusivity remedy",42517c5ee6,"LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTY AND LIABILITY:
(d) Seller’s maximum liability for all claims for any reason is the invoice price of the Product(s) involved. Neither Party will be liable to the other Party in contract, tort, negligence, breach of statutory laws, or otherwise for any losses, damages, costs, or expenses of any nature whatsoever that may be incurred or suffered by or in any event could otherwise be awarded to that other Party which are of a special, incidental, punitive, consequential, indirect, or exemplary nature, including, without limitation, any economic loss or other loss of turnover, profits, business, or goodwill.
(e) The remedies set forth in this Section 7 are exclusive, and no other remedy or remedies are available to Buyer, whether in law or equity. Buyer and Seller agree that the remedies contained herein are adequate remedies.","The clause **""LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTY AND LIABILITY""** (specifically subsections (d) and (e)) is highly relevant to the query regarding **""product replacement, repair, or refund as exclusivity remedy""** in the following ways:

### **1. Exclusivity of Remedies (Subsection (e))**  
- The clause explicitly states that the remedies provided in **Section 7** (which presumably includes repair, replacement, or refund) are the **exclusive** remedies available to the Buyer.  
- This means the Buyer **cannot** seek additional remedies (such as damages, injunctive relief, or specific performance) beyond what is contractually agreed upon.  
- The clause reinforces that these remedies are deemed **adequate**, preventing the Buyer from arguing that they are insufficient under law or equity.  

### **2. Limitation of Liability (Subsection (d))**  
- The Seller’s maximum liability is **capped at the invoice price** of the product(s) involved.  
- The clause **excludes** liability for **consequential, indirect, punitive, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, goodwill).  
- This means that even if the Buyer suffers additional losses due to a defective product, they **cannot** claim compensation beyond the agreed remedies (repair, replacement, or refund).  

### **Comparison with External Information**  
The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 10.12*) discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) being available when monetary damages are inadequate. However, the **clause in question explicitly overrides this** by:  
- **Restricting remedies** to only those specified (repair/replacement/refund).  
- **Waiving equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) unless explicitly preserved elsewhere in the agreement.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **narrows the Buyer’s recourse** to only the contractual remedies (repair, replacement, or refund) and **bars any additional claims** (whether legal or equitable). If the Buyer attempts to seek alternative remedies (e.g., suing for lost profits or demanding specific performance), the Seller can rely on this clause to **limit liability strictly to the agreed terms**.

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Relevance Points:
1. **Exclusive Remedies for Non-Conforming Products**:  
   The clause specifies that if Products fail to meet the warranties (e.g., defects, non-compliance with specifications, or applicable laws), the Customer’s **exclusive remedies** are limited to:
   - **Repair or replacement** (either by Philips or the Customer in the field), or  
   - **Refund** of the purchase price for non-conforming Products.  
   This aligns with the query’s focus on exclusivity of remedies.

2. **Conditions Triggering Remedies**:  
   The remedies are contingent on the Products breaching the warranties under **Clause 7.1**, which covers:
   - Conformity to specifications,  
   - Fitness for purpose,  
   - Freedom from defects, and  
   - Compliance with laws.  
   The external information (e.g., representations/warranties needing to be ""true and correct"") reinforces that remedies are tied to warranty breaches.

3. **Procedure for Electing Remedies**:  
   The Customer must **consult Philips** before choosing a remedy, and the election must be **reasonable**. This implies the remedies are structured and not arbitrary.

4. **Warranty Extension for Repaired/Replaced Products**:  
   Repaired or replaced Products are covered for the **remainder of the original warranty term**, ensuring continuity of protection.

5. **No Prejudice to Other Rights**:  
   While the clause provides these exclusive remedies, it clarifies that other legal or contractual rights are not extinguished (""Without prejudice to any other rights..."").

### Connection to External Information:  
The external snippets highlight that warranties must be ""true and correct"" as of key dates (e.g., consummation of the Offer). This mirrors the clause’s reliance on warranties being breached for remedies to apply. If warranties are false (e.g., Products are defective), the clause’s remedies become operative.

### Conclusion:  
The clause directly answers the query by defining repair, replacement, and refund as the **exclusive contractual remedies** for warranty breaches, subject to consultation and reasonableness. It also ties these remedies to the broader framework of warranty compliance, as referenced in the external information.",5

The Company further warrants that the Products have been manufactured, labeled and packaged, and when in the Company's possession or under its control, have been handled, stored and shipped, in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. The Customer's exclusive remedy for a breach of any of the foregoing warranties will be the replacement, at the delivery point thereof, freight prepaid, of any Product furnished hereunder that fails to meet the foregoing standards. In no event will the Company be liable for incidental or consequential damages.","The **""2.6. Warranty"" clause** is directly relevant to the **query about product warranty and shelf life** because it explicitly addresses both topics. Here’s how:

1. **Shelf Life Warranty**:  
   - The clause guarantees that all Products sold to the Customer will have a **remaining shelf life of at least 12 months at the time of shipment**. This ensures the Products remain usable/salable for a specified duration post-delivery, which is critical for perishable or time-sensitive goods.  
   - If the Product fails to meet this standard, the Customer’s remedy is **replacement** (freight prepaid).

2. **General Product Warranty**:  
   - The clause also includes broader warranties:  
     - **Merchantability/commercially salable quality** (standard UCC-type warranty).  
     - **Compliance with laws** (manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, and shipping).  
   - These tie into the ""representations and warranties"" referenced in the external snippets, where accuracy of such warranties is a condition for contractual obligations (e.g., Offer expiration).

3. **Limitations**:  
   - The clause limits the Company’s liability to **replacement of non-conforming Products**, excluding incidental/consequential damages. This aligns with typical warranty structures in commercial contracts.  

### Connection to External Information:  
The external snippets highlight that the truthfulness of warranties (like those in **Section 2.6**) is a **condition** for contractual milestones (e.g., Offer expiration). While the snippets don’t mention shelf life specifically, they underscore the importance of warranties being ""true and correct"" at key times, which would include the **12-month shelf life promise** in this clause.  

### Summary:  
This clause directly answers the query by:  
- Defining the **shelf life warranty** (12 months minimum).  
- Linking to broader **product quality and legal compliance warranties**.  
- Specifying **remedies and liability limits** for breaches.  
- Implicitly connecting to the external context where warranties must remain accurate for contractual validity.

1. **Shelf Life Warranty**:  
   - The clause states that the Company warrants that all Products, **at the time of shipment**, will have a **remaining shelf life of at least 12 months**.  
   - This ensures that the Customer receives Products with a guaranteed minimum usable lifespan, which is critical for inventory management, resale, or consumption purposes.  

2. **Additional Quality and Compliance Warranties**:  
   - The Products must also be **merchantable, commercially salable**, and manufactured, labeled, stored, and shipped in compliance with **applicable laws**.

Similarly, the **2.6 Warranty** clause ensures that the shelf life warranty is true **at shipment**, aligning with the principle that warranties must be accurate at specified times.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause directly answers the query by:  
- Guaranteeing a **minimum 12-month shelf life** at shipment.  
- Outlining consequences for breach (replacement only).  
- Linking shelf life to broader product quality and legal compliance.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Shelf Life Warranty**  
The clause states that the Company warrants that all Products, **at the time of shipment**, will have a **remaining shelf life of at least 12 months**. This is a specific guarantee about the durability and usability of the Products, ensuring they meet a minimum shelf life standard when delivered.  

### 2. **Quality and Compliance Warranty**  
In addition to shelf life, the clause includes warranties that the Products:  
   - Are **merchantable and commercially salable** (general quality assurance).

### 3. **Remedy for Breach**  
If the Products fail to meet the shelf life or other warranty standards, the Customer’s **exclusive remedy** is replacement of the non-conforming Products (freight prepaid by the Company). The clause limits liability by excluding **incidental or consequential damages**.  

### 4. **Claims Process**  
Claims for breach of warranty (including shelf life) must follow the Company’s published procedures, which may be updated periodically.  

### Connection to External References  
While the external excerpts discuss **general representations and warranties** in agreements (e.g., accuracy as of the Offer expiration), they do not directly address shelf life. However, they highlight the broader legal context where warranties (like the shelf life warranty here) are typically enforced—i.e., they must be **true and correct as of specific timelines** (e.g., shipment/delivery).  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause is a **standalone product warranty provision** that:  
- Guarantees a **minimum 12-month shelf life** at shipment.  
- Ties compliance and quality to legal standards.  
- Defines remedies and limits liability.  

For the query, this clause provides the **specific contractual assurance** sought regarding shelf life warranties in product sales.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Shelf Life Warranty**:  
   - The clause acts as a warranty by Qualigen, ensuring that all products shipped will have a **minimum remaining shelf life** (3 months for U.S. shipments, 4 months for international shipments). This guarantees that Sekisui receives products with sufficient usability duration, reducing the risk of expiration before resale or use.  

2. **Geographic Differentiation**:  
   - The clause accounts for logistical differences (e.g., longer transit times for international shipments) by requiring a longer shelf life (4 months) for products shipped outside the U.S.  

3. **Flexibility for Custom Orders**:  
   - It allows for negotiated extensions to the minimum shelf life for specific customer orders, provided Qualigen and the Sekisui customer mutually agree. This ensures adaptability to unique customer needs.  

4. **Implied Quality Assurance**:  
   - By tying the warranty to the **date of shipment**, Qualigen implicitly warrants that the products are fresh and meet quality standards at the time of transfer to Sekisui.  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external clauses focus on restrictions during agreement periods (e.g., prohibitions on actions without consent), your clause is more specific to **product performance warranties**. However, the principle of **""not unreasonably withholding consent""** (seen in the external texts) aligns with the flexibility in your clause for mutually agreed shelf-life extensions.  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause is a **product-specific warranty** that safeguards Sekisui against receiving near-expiry goods, ensuring compliance with shelf-life expectations and enabling contractual recourse if breached. It complements broader contractual obligations (like those in the external examples) by addressing a tangible deliverable (product shelf life).

The Company further warrants that the Products have been manufactured, labeled and packaged, and when in the Company's possession or under its control, have been handled, stored and shipped, in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. The Customer's exclusive remedy for a breach of any of the foregoing warranties will be the replacement, at the delivery point thereof, freight prepaid, of any Product furnished hereunder that fails to meet the foregoing standards. In no event will the Company be liable for incidental or consequential damages.","The **Warranty Clause (2.6)** is directly relevant to the query about **product warranty around manufacturing and shipping** because it outlines the specific assurances the Company provides regarding the quality, compliance, and handling of the Products during these stages. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Manufacturing Warranty**  
   - The Company warrants that the Products:  
     - Are **merchantable and commercially salable** (meeting general market standards).  
     - Have a **remaining shelf life of at least 12 months** at the time of shipment.  
     - Are **manufactured, labeled, and packaged in compliance with all applicable laws** (federal, state, and local).  
   - This addresses **manufacturing quality control** and regulatory adherence, ensuring the Products are fit for purpose and legally compliant when produced.

### 2. **Shipping/Handling Warranty**  
   - The Company guarantees that while the Products are **in its possession or under its control**, they have been:  
     - **Handled, stored, and shipped properly** (e.g., under conditions preserving quality and legality).  
   - This covers potential risks during **logistics**, such as improper storage or transportation that could degrade the Product.

### 3. **Remedy for Breach**  
   - The Customer’s **exclusive remedy** for a warranty breach is **replacement** of non-conforming Products (freight prepaid).  
   - The Company **excludes liability for incidental/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits), limiting its exposure to direct costs of replacement.  

### Connection to External References  
The external snippets highlight that representations/warranties (like those in Clause 2.6) must remain true at key transaction milestones (e.g., Offer expiration). Here, the warranties apply **at shipment**, ensuring the Products meet standards when transferred to the Customer.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause is critical for the query because it:  
- Defines **quality and legal standards** for manufacturing.  
- Covers **shipping/handling risks** under the Company’s control.  
- Limits remedies to **replacement**, excluding broader liabilities.  

It aligns with the broader contractual focus on warranties being ""true and correct"" at specific times (as noted in the external references), here tied to the **point of shipment**.",5

In no event will the Company be liable for incidental or consequential damages. <omitted>","The **Warranty Clause (2.6)** is directly relevant to the query about **product warranty around manufacturing and shipping** because it outlines the specific warranties provided by the Company regarding the quality, compliance, and handling of the Products during manufacturing and shipping. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Manufacturing Warranty**  
The clause explicitly states that the Company warrants the Products:  
- **Are merchantable and commercially salable** (meeting general market standards).  
- **Have a remaining shelf life of at least 12 months** at the time of shipment.  
- **Have been manufactured, labeled, and packaged in compliance with all applicable laws** (federal, state, and local).  

This ensures that the Products are free from defects and meet legal standards at the time of production.  

### **2. Shipping & Handling Warranty**  
The Company further warrants that:  
- **While in its possession or control**, the Products have been **handled, stored, and shipped properly** (in compliance with laws).  
- This covers potential damage or degradation due to improper logistics before delivery.  

### **3. Remedies for Breach**  
- The **exclusive remedy** for breach is **replacement** of non-conforming Products (freight prepaid).  
- The Company **excludes liability for incidental or consequential damages**, limiting its exposure beyond replacement.  

### **Connection to External References**  
The external references (e.g., *maud_595*, *maud_898*) discuss **representations and warranties needing to remain true at key transaction stages** (e.g., Offer expiration). While they don’t directly address manufacturing/shipping warranties, they highlight the broader legal principle that warranties must hold at critical points (like shipment). Clause 2.6 operationalizes this by specifying **when** (at shipment) and **how** (via compliance and quality standards) warranties apply.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **central to the query** because it:  
- Defines **quality and legal compliance** warranties tied to manufacturing.  
- Covers **shipping/handling integrity** while Products are under the Company’s control.  
- Limits liability, aligning with common contractual risk allocation in commercial agreements.

Seller warrants that upon shipment the Goods will conform to the specifications, if any, agreed to in writing by the parties or, if none, to Seller’s standard specifications for such Goods and that upon payment of the purchase price in full Buyer will have good title to the Goods, free and clear of any liens (except those caused by Buyer). Seller reserves the right (but is not obligated) to deliver to Buyer Goods produced at any manufacturing site. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE OR AS REQUIRED BY VIRTUE OF MANDATORY LAW, SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING THE GOODS OR THE CONTAINERS IN WHICH THE GOODS ARE SHIPPED. SELLER EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE GOODS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.","The **Warranty Clause** you provided is directly relevant to the query about **product warranty around manufacturing and shipping** in the following ways:  

### **1. Warranty Scope (Manufacturing & Conformity)**  
- The Seller warrants that the **Goods will conform to agreed specifications** (or Seller’s standard specs if none are agreed) **upon shipment**.  
- This ensures that the product meets quality/design standards **at the time of shipping**, covering **manufacturing defects** that would render the Goods non-conforming.  

### **2. Title Warranty (Shipping & Ownership)**  
- The Seller guarantees that upon full payment, the Buyer will receive **good title** to the Goods, free of liens (unless caused by Buyer).  
- This protects the Buyer against **ownership disputes** arising during or after shipping.  

### **3. Limitation of Warranties (Shipping & Liability)**  
- The Seller **disclaims all other warranties**, including implied warranties (e.g., merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose), unless required by mandatory law.  
- This shifts risk to the Buyer post-shipment unless defects are proven to violate the express warranty (conformity at shipment).  

### **Comparison with External References**  
The external clauses (from M&A agreements) discuss **representations/warranties being true at closing**, similar to how this clause ensures conformity **at shipment**. However, your clause is narrower—focused on **product condition at shipping**, not ongoing post-sale obligations.  

### **Key Relevance to Query**  
- **Manufacturing:** Warranty covers defects existing **at production** (if they cause non-conformity at shipment).  
- **Shipping:** Warranty applies **upon shipment**, not afterward (unless mandatory law overrides the disclaimer).  
- **Buyer’s Protection:** Limited to title and pre-shipment conformity; post-delivery issues (e.g., transit damage) are not covered unless caused by Seller’s breach.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Warranty Scope and Duration**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the Products are warranted to be **free from defects in design, materials, and workmanship** for **24 months after delivery to the end-user**. This covers manufacturing defects (e.g., faulty materials or poor craftsmanship) and ensures compliance with quality standards.  
   - The warranty also extends to **legal compliance**, ensuring Products meet all applicable laws, are non-hazardous, and do not infringe third-party rights (e.g., patents). This addresses potential liabilities arising from manufacturing or design flaws.  

### 2. **Warranty Performance and Remedies**  
   - If the Company fails to perform warranty work **promptly and without reasonable cause**, the Distributor may arrange repairs (or hire a third party) at the Company’s expense. This ensures accountability for post-shipping defects.  
   - The Company must **repair, replace, or provide replacement parts** for defective Products reported within the warranty period. This mitigates risks for the Distributor if manufacturing defects emerge after shipping.  

### 3. **Shipping and Condition of Products**  
   - The Company reserves the right to reject Products that are **not factory-sealed or in new/unused condition**, implying warranties apply only to properly shipped and handled goods. This ties shipping integrity to warranty validity.  
   - Defects discovered **within 365 days of installation** must be reported promptly, linking warranty claims to the post-shipping inspection timeline.  

### 4. **Limitations and Exceptions**  
   - The Company’s warranty obligations expire **365 days after delivery to the Distributor** (unless defects are reported under the 24-month end-user warranty). This creates a tiered warranty structure, distinguishing between Distributor and end-user claims.  
   - Emergency repairs (where the Company cannot act) allow the Distributor to intervene, addressing urgent post-shipping defects.  

### Connection to External Information  
While the external excerpts focus on general representations/warranties and contractual conditions, the clause here **operationalizes** those principles by:  
   - Specifying **how** manufacturing/shipping defects are handled (e.g., repairs, replacements).  
   - Aligning with broader contractual terms (e.g., compliance with laws, as hinted in *maud_595*).  
   - Ensuring enforceability through clear timelines and remedies.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause directly addresses the query by defining:  
- The **manufacturing warranty** (defects in design/materials).  
- **Shipping-related protections** (factory-sealed condition, post-delivery reporting).  
- **Distributor’s recourse** for breaches, ensuring accountability across the supply chain.

   - The Company **excludes liability for incidental or consequential damages**, limiting its exposure to direct replacement costs.  

### 3. **Indemnification (Clause 3.5)**

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Provisions Addressing Customer Rights for Defective Products:
1. **Warranty Coverage**  
   - The Company warrants that Products will be **free from defects in design, materials, and workmanship** for **24 months after delivery to the end-user**. This directly protects the end-user’s right to defect-free products during this period.

2. **Remedies for Defects**  
   - If defects are reported (via oral or written notice) within the warranty period, the Company must **correct the defect** by providing repairs, replacement parts, or replacement Products. This ensures customers receive functional products as promised.

3. **Distributor’s Right to Act on Behalf of Customers**  
   - If the Company fails to perform warranty work **promptly or without reasonable cause**, the Distributor may:  
     - Perform the repairs itself or hire a third party.  
     - Recover **reasonable costs** from the Company.  
   This safeguards customers from delays or refusal by the Company to honor warranties.

4. **Emergency Repairs**  
   - In cases of **emergency repairs** (e.g., safety hazards), the Distributor can act immediately without waiting for the Company, ensuring customer safety and minimizing downtime.

5. **Compliance and Safety Guarantees**  
   - The Company represents that Products:  
     - Comply with all laws.  
     - Are **not hazardous or dangerous** when used as intended.  
     - Do not cause environmental harm or infringe third-party rights.  
   These assurances protect customers from legal, safety, or environmental risks.

6. **Limitations and Exceptions**  
   - The Company’s warranty obligations expire **after 365 days** for most issues (unless defects are reported within 24 months).  
   - Products must be **factory-sealed and unused** for returns (unless under the Annual Notice exception in Section 3.1).  

### Why This Matters for Customers:  
- **Clear Recourse**: Customers (via Distributors) have enforceable rights to repairs, replacements, or refunds for defective products.  
- **Timely Resolution**: The clause prevents unreasonable delays by allowing third-party repairs at the Company’s expense.  
- **Safety and Compliance**: Customers are assured products meet legal and safety standards.  

### External Context:  
While the external references (e.g., representations/warranties in other clauses) are not directly cited here, they likely reinforce broader obligations of the Company to uphold product quality, aligning with this clause’s focus on defect liability.  

**Conclusion**: This clause explicitly defines the **rights of end-users (customers)** to defect-free products and the **process for redress**, making it central to the query.",5
customer's right for defective products,5167d4bf26,"Your exclusive remedy, if any, under these warranties is limited, at Seller's election, to: (a) refund of Your purchase price, (b) repair by Seller or Supplier(s)of any Products or services found to be defective, or (c) replacement of any such Product or reperformance of any services. If there is no Supplier warranty, You take all such Products and services “as-is” without any warranty. You acknowledge that except as specifically set forth herein, THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND BY SELLER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THEIR MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR OTHERWISE. SELLER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR SUPPLIERS’ PRODUCT OR SERVICE SPECIFICATIONS OR THE PERFORMANCE OR ADEQUACY OF ANY DESIGN OR SPECIFICATION PROVIDED TO SELLER.","The clause is highly relevant to the customer's rights regarding defective products, as it explicitly outlines the limited remedies available to the customer and disclaims most other warranties or liabilities. Here's how it addresses the query:

1. **Limited Remedies for Defective Products**:  
   The clause states that the customer's **exclusive remedy** for defective products or services is limited to one of the following (at the seller's election):  
   - (a) Refund of the purchase price  
   - (b) Repair of the defective product/service  
   - (c) Replacement of the product or reperformance of the service  

   This means the customer cannot seek additional damages (e.g., consequential losses) beyond these options unless otherwise specified in the agreement.

2. **""As-Is"" Basis for Non-Warranted Products**:  
   If there is no supplier warranty, the customer accepts the products/services **""as-is""** with no warranty protection at all. This severely limits the customer's rights in such cases.

3. **Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   The clause explicitly disclaims all other warranties, including:  
   - **Merchantability** (whether the product is fit for ordinary use)  
   - **Fitness for a particular purpose**  
   - **Non-infringement**  
   - Any other implied warranties  

   This means the customer cannot rely on general legal protections that might otherwise apply to defective products (e.g., under the UCC in the U.S. or consumer protection laws in other jurisdictions).

4. **No Liability for Supplier Specifications**:  
   The seller disclaims responsibility for defects arising from supplier-provided designs or specifications, further narrowing the customer's recourse.

### Relevance to External Information:  
The external snippets discuss **representations and warranties** needing to be ""true and correct"" at the time of contract execution. However, the clause here **overrides** such general assurances by:  
- Limiting warranties to only those **expressly stated** in the agreement.  
- Excluding implied warranties, even if other parts of the contract suggest broader assurances.  

### Key Takeaway for the Customer:  
The customer’s rights for defective products are **strictly confined** to the remedies listed (refund, repair, or replacement). Any broader claims based on implied warranties or supplier defects are likely unenforceable under this clause.

Here's a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause Addressing Customer Rights for Defective Products:
1. **Right to Reject Non-Complying or Defective Products**  
   - The customer has the explicit right to reject products that:  
     - Do not comply with the agreement (""Non-Complying Products"").  
     - Are delivered in violation of the agreement.  
     - Have **latent defects** (defects not discoverable through standard inspection/testing).  
     - Are defective due to the manufacturer's breach of warranties/representations.  

2. **Timeframes for Rejection**  
   - **Standard defects**: Customer must notify the manufacturer within **75 days** of receipt.  
   - **Latent defects**: Customer may reject until the product's expiry date, provided notice is given within **60 days** of discovering the defect.  
   - This ensures the customer has adequate time to identify and act on defects, even those not immediately apparent.  

3. **Manufacturer's Obligations**  
   - The manufacturer must follow a structured process to reject a customer's claim of non-compliance (e.g., 60-day notice, documentation, and meetings). This protects the customer from arbitrary rejections of their complaints.  

4. **Specific Protections for Latent Defects**  
   - The clause explicitly covers defects that emerge later or are hidden, ensuring the customer is not unfairly penalized for defects beyond their control.  

### Connection to External Information (Contextual Relevance):  
While the external information provided discusses termination rights and notice periods in merger agreements (e.g., Superior Proposals), the core theme aligns with the clause:  
- Both emphasize **written notice requirements** and **time-bound remedies** for contractual breaches.  
- The clause here focuses on **product defects**, while the external examples address **corporate actions**, but the legal principles (notice, timelines, materiality) are analogous.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The clause clearly defines:  
- **What constitutes a defective product** (including latent defects).  
- **How and when the customer can act** (notice periods, documentation).  
- **Balanced protections** for both parties (e.g., manufacturer's right to contest rejections).  

This ensures the customer has enforceable rights while providing the manufacturer procedural safeguards.  

**Conclusion**: The clause directly addresses the query by outlining the customer's rights, procedures, and timelines for rejecting defective products, with special attention to latent defects—a critical concern in product quality disputes.",5

The clause repeatedly states that Accuray's obligations and the customer's remedies for defective products, software, or legally required safety updates are **""sole and exclusive.""** This means:  
- The customer **cannot seek additional remedies** beyond what is specified (e.g., repair, replacement, or pro-rated refund).  
- The clause **limits liability** to these predefined solutions unless mandatory law (e.g., strict product liability) overrides this limitation.  

### **2. Specific Remedies for Defective Products**  
If a customer reports a defect during the **Warranty Period**, Accuray must, at its option:  
- **Repair or replace** the defective product.  
- If repair/replacement is **not commercially reasonable**, provide a **pro-rated refund** (calculated over a 5-year depreciation period).  

This ensures the customer has a **clear, enforceable right** to a remedy for defective products.  

### **3. Limitations on Liability**  
The clause **excludes** certain types of damages unless they result from:  
- **Unauthorized use of intellectual property** (e.g., patent/copyright infringement).  
- **Intentional breach or willful misconduct** by a party.  
- **Violation of mandatory laws** (e.g., strict product liability under consumer protection laws).  

Specifically, it disclaims liability for:  
- **Consequential, incidental, punitive, or tort damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption).  
- **Total liability cap**: For most breaches, liability is limited to the **purchase price paid in the 12 months before the claim**.  

### **4. Interaction with Mandatory Law**  
The clause **preserves rights under mandatory applicable law**, meaning:  
- If local consumer protection laws grant **additional rights** (e.g., full refund, extended warranties), those rights **cannot be waived**.  
- **Strict product liability claims** (e.g., for injuries caused by defects) are **not affected** by this clause.  

### **5. Relevance to External Information**  
The external references (e.g., **specific performance, injunctive relief**) reinforce that:  
- Courts may enforce **specific remedies** (e.g., repair/replacement) if monetary damages are inadequate.  
- However, the clause **narrows** the customer’s remedies to those explicitly stated, unless overridden by law.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause defines the **customer’s rights for defective products** while **limiting Accuray’s liability** to repair, replacement, or a pro-rated refund. It balances contractual limitations with **mandatory legal protections**, ensuring compliance with consumer laws while restricting additional claims (e.g., consequential damages). Customers should verify if their jurisdiction’s laws provide **stronger protections** beyond this clause.

customer's right for defective products,53fc343ad4,"The Customer shall inspect all Products promptly upon receipt thereof and may reject any defective Product, provided that the Customer shall within seven (7) days after receipt of such alleged defective Product, notify the Manufacturer of its rejection and either: (i) request to destroy in field for credit of the value of the defective product and the associated shipping costs (with approval), or (ii) request a Return Material Authorization (""RMA"") number and within seven (7) days of receipt of the RMA number from the Manufacturer return such rejected Product to the Manufacturer.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about a **customer's rights for defective products** because it outlines the specific rights and procedures a customer has when they receive defective products from the manufacturer. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause Related to Customer Rights for Defective Products:**
1. **Right to Inspect & Reject Defective Products**  
   - The customer has the right to inspect products upon receipt and reject any that are defective.  
   - This ensures the customer is not forced to accept substandard goods.

2. **Notification Requirement (7-Day Window)**  
   - The customer must notify the manufacturer **within seven (7) days** of receiving the defective product.  
   - This sets a clear deadline for raising complaints, protecting both parties from prolonged disputes.

3. **Two Remedies for Defective Products**  
   The customer has **two options** when rejecting a defective product:  
   - **(i) Request Destruction & Credit**  
     - The customer can ask to destroy the defective product (with approval) and receive a **credit** for its value plus **shipping costs**.  
   - **(ii) Request an RMA & Return the Product**  
     - The customer can request a **Return Material Authorization (RMA)** and must return the product within **seven (7) days** of receiving the RMA.  

### **Why This Matters for the Query**  
- The clause **clearly defines** the customer’s rights when dealing with defective products, ensuring they have recourse.  
- It imposes **reasonable time limits** (7 days for notification and return) to prevent indefinite claims.  
- It provides **two structured remedies** (credit or return), giving the customer flexibility in resolving the issue.  

### **Contrast with External Information (M&A Context)**  
The external references discuss **notice periods in mergers & acquisitions** (e.g., 4-day or 2-day notice requirements for deal changes). While they involve **notice obligations**, they are unrelated to **consumer rights for defective products**.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is highly relevant because it **explicitly grants the customer rights** when receiving defective products, including:  
✔ Right to reject defective goods  
✔ Clear deadlines for action  
✔ Two structured resolution options (credit or return)  

This ensures fairness and efficiency in handling defective product claims.",5

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The provided clause is a **seller-favorable warranty disclaimer** because it significantly limits the seller's liability by disclaiming all warranties except those explicitly stated in the agreement. Here’s how it aligns with the query and the external context:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Exclusive Warranties** – The clause states that **only** the representations and warranties explicitly listed in the agreement apply. This narrows the scope of the seller’s obligations and prevents claims based on unwritten assurances or common-law warranties.  
   - *Relevance to External Info*: The external excerpts (e.g., *""other than those set forth in the foregoing clauses""*) similarly emphasize that only specified warranties survive, reinforcing the seller’s protection.  

2. **Broad Disclaimer of Implied/Statutory Warranties** – The seller explicitly disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose), which are typically imposed by law unless excluded. This shifts risk to the buyer.  
   - *Relevance to Query*: This is a classic seller-protective tactic, ensuring the buyer cannot rely on default legal protections beyond the contract’s terms.  

3. **Non-Infringement Carve-Out** – The disclaimer explicitly excludes any warranties of non-infringement unless stated in the agreement. This is critical for sellers in IP-heavy transactions (e.g., software, patents) to avoid open-ended liability.  

### Why This Matters for the Seller:
- **Risk Mitigation**: By disclaiming implied warranties, the seller avoids liability for issues not expressly covered in the contract (e.g., latent defects).  
- **Predictability**: The clause ensures that the seller’s obligations are strictly limited to the agreed terms, reducing litigation risk from broad warranty claims.  
- **Alignment with External Context**: The external snippets highlight how warranties are often tied to specific conditions (e.g., ""true and correct as of consummation""), further narrowing the seller’s exposure.  

### Buyer Implications:
- The buyer assumes more risk, as they cannot rely on standard legal warranties unless explicitly included.  
- Due diligence becomes critical, as the buyer must ensure all necessary protections are expressly written into the contract.  

In summary, this clause is **highly seller-favorable** by contractually excluding all warranties beyond the bare minimum, aligning with the restrictive approach seen in the external examples.",5

Here’s how it aligns with the query and why it benefits the seller:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Broad Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose), which are typically imposed by law unless excluded. This protects the seller from claims based on unwritten expectations.  

2. **Exclusion of Course of Conduct Warranties**  
   - It negates any warranties that might arise from past dealings, industry practices, or performance patterns, ensuring the seller isn’t bound by informal understandings.  

3. **""As-Is"" Tone**  
   - By stating that no warranties exist beyond the agreement’s express terms, the seller shifts risk to the buyer, who must rely solely on the contract’s written promises.  

### Relevance to the External Information:  
The external excerpts highlight conditions where representations/warranties must be true at specific times (e.g., at the ""Expiration Time"" or ""consummation of the Offer""). Your clause complements such provisions by:  
- **Narrowing the Scope**: It ensures that only the warranties explicitly listed in the agreement are enforceable, preventing buyers from arguing that other implied terms apply.  
- **Aligning with Conditions**: If the agreement elsewhere specifies limited warranties (as in the external examples), this disclaimer reinforces that no others exist, reducing the seller’s exposure.  

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:  
- **Risk Allocation**: The buyer assumes the risk of defects or performance issues not covered by the express warranties.  
- **Litigation Shield**: The seller can defend against breach-of-warranty claims by pointing to the disclaimer’s comprehensive language.  

In summary, this clause is a strong seller-protective measure by systematically eliminating unintended warranties and limiting liability to the contract’s four corners.",5

Here’s how it aligns with the query and external references:

### **Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:**
1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement), which are typically imposed by law unless explicitly waived.  
   - This protects the seller from claims based on unwritten expectations or general legal standards.

2. **""As-Is"" Basis**  
   - By stating that **no representations or warranties exist except those expressly stated**, the seller shifts risk to the buyer, ensuring they rely only on the written terms of the agreement.  

3. **Alignment with External References**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., *Maud_100*, *Maud_898*) reinforce that warranties are **only binding if explicitly stated** in the agreement.  
   - For example, *Maud_100* specifies that representations/warranties must be ""true and correct as of the Expiration Time,"" implying that **unenumerated warranties are excluded**.  

### **Why This is Seller-Favorable:**  
- The seller avoids liability for **unstated or implied promises**.  
- The buyer assumes the risk for any issues not covered in the express warranties.  
- Courts generally enforce such disclaimers if they are **clear and conspicuous** (as this one is, with capitalized text).  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause is a strong **seller-protective provision** that minimizes legal exposure by disclaiming all warranties beyond the written agreement, consistent with the referenced material. Buyers should scrutinize the **express warranties** (if any) to understand their actual protections.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **all representations and warranties** except those expressly stated in **Section 7.1 (Representations)**.  
   - This means the seller avoids liability for any **implied warranties** (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement) that might otherwise apply by law or trade practice.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
   - The seller disclaims warranties arising from **course of dealing, performance, or trade usage**, which are common protections buyers might rely on.  
   - This strengthens the seller’s position by preventing claims based on unwritten expectations.

3. **Specific Disclaimers on Economic Benefits**  
   - The seller explicitly denies any guarantee regarding:  
     - **Sales revenues** (removing liability if projected revenues aren’t met).  
     - **Economic benefits** (except for payments explicitly agreed in the contract).  
   - This protects the seller from claims if the deal underperforms the buyer’s expectations.

4. **Risk Allocation to the Buyer**  
   - By waiving most warranties, the buyer assumes the risk of defects, performance issues, or unmet expectations unless fraud or breach of the **limited express warranties** (Section 7.1) is proven.  

### Relevance to External Information:  
- The external clauses (e.g., **specific performance** in *Section 8.5*) reinforce that remedies for breach are limited to contractual terms, not implied warranties.  
- The **""true and correct as of consummation""** language (from *maud_898*) suggests that warranties are narrowly defined and time-bound, aligning with this disclaimer’s restrictive approach.  

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:  
- **Reduces litigation risk** by narrowing the grounds for claims.  
- **Shifts bargaining power** to the seller, forcing the buyer to rely solely on negotiated terms.  
- **Limits post-closing liability**, especially for subjective expectations (e.g., revenue projections).

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTION 12, THE PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause you provided is a **seller-favorable warranty disclaimer** because it limits the seller's liability by disclaiming most warranties, except those explicitly stated in the agreement (in this case, Section 12). Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Broad Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose), which are typically imposed by law unless excluded. This protects the seller from claims arising from unwritten expectations about the product/service.

2. **Narrow Carve-Out for Express Warranties**  
   - The disclaimer applies universally **except as stated in Section 12**, meaning the seller’s obligations are strictly limited to the warranties explicitly listed in that section. This ensures the seller isn’t bound by unintended assurances.

3. **Subject Matter Coverage**  
   - The disclaimer applies broadly to ""the subject matter of this Agreement,"" leaving little room for ambiguity about its scope.

### Relevance to the Query:
The query seeks seller-favorable warranty disclaimers, and this clause is a classic example because:
- It shifts risk to the buyer by negating implied warranties that might otherwise provide legal recourse.  
- It ensures the seller’s liability is confined to the express terms of the contract (Section 12), reducing exposure to unforeseen claims.  
- The language is unambiguous (""EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED"") to withstand judicial scrutiny, which is critical for enforceability.

### Connection to External Information:
While the external excerpts focus on **specific performance** (enforcement via injunctions), they indirectly support the clause’s enforceability. Courts often uphold disclaimers like this if they are clear and conspicuous (as here, with capitalized text). The emphasis on contractual remedies (e.g., injunctions) in the external clauses aligns with the broader theme of limiting liability—consistent with a seller-favorable disclaimer.

### Practical Impact:
- **Buyer Beware**: The buyer assumes the risk for issues not covered in Section 12.  
- **Litigation Defense**: The seller can cite this clause to dismiss claims based on implied warranties.

Here’s how it aligns with the query and external context:

### Key Buyer-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Narrow Scope of Warranties**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that **only the representations and warranties expressly set forth in the agreement** apply. This prevents the seller from relying on broader or unwritten assurances, which protects the buyer from undisclosed risks.  
   - The external references (e.g., *maud_898* and *maud_100*) highlight that warranties must be ""true and correct"" as of key dates (e.g., consummation of the Offer). By disclaiming all other warranties, the buyer ensures they are not bound by vague or unstated claims.

2. **Explicit Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause **disclaims all implied and statutory warranties**, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This is buyer-favorable because it forces the seller to explicitly define obligations in the contract, reducing ambiguity.  
   - The external context shows that warranties outside specific sections are excluded (*maud_100*: ""other than those Sections specifically identified""), reinforcing the buyer’s ability to limit liability.

3. **Non-Infringement Carve-Out**:  
   - The disclaimer clarifies that **non-infringement warranties are excluded unless expressly stated**. This protects the buyer from unintended infringement claims unless the seller explicitly guarantees otherwise in the agreement.

### Why This Benefits the Buyer:
- **Risk Allocation**: The buyer avoids liability for gaps in warranties not explicitly negotiated.  
- **Certainty**: The clause aligns with the external examples where warranties are tightly scoped to specific sections and timelines (e.g., ""as of the Expiration Time"").  
- **Negotiation Leverage**: By disclaiming implied terms, the buyer can push for stronger **express warranties** in critical areas (e.g., title, compliance).

### Connection to External Context:
The external snippets emphasize that warranties are limited to certain sections and must be accurate at specific times. The disclaimer clause complements this by **reinforcing that no other warranties exist**, ensuring the buyer’s reliance is strictly tied to the agreed terms.

### Conclusion:
This clause is **buyer-favorable** because it:  
1. Restricts warranties to only those expressly stated.  
2. Eliminates ""hidden"" implied warranties.  
3. Aligns with the external examples’ focus on precision and timing of warranties.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Buyer-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties**  
   - The clause disclaims **all implied warranties** (merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, etc.), except for the explicit representations in Section 7.1.  
   - This protects the buyer from claims based on unwritten expectations or general trade practices.  

2. **Exclusion of Financial Guarantees**  
   - The seller explicitly disclaims any warranty regarding:  
     - Future sales revenues (protecting the seller from unrealistic buyer expectations).  
     - Economic benefits beyond the agreed payments (preventing buyer claims if the deal underperforms).  
   - This shifts **commercial risk** to the buyer, which is favorable to the seller but can also benefit a buyer by clarifying the absence of hidden assurances.  

3. **Narrow Exceptions**  
   - The only surviving warranties are those **expressly stated in Section 7.1**, forcing the buyer to rely solely on documented representations rather than broader assurances.  

### Relevance to External Context:  
- The external excerpts highlight clauses about **enforceability of terms** (specific performance) and **conditions for representations/warranties** to remain true at closing.  
- Your warranty disclaimer complements these by:  
  - Limiting the scope of enforceable claims (aligning with the emphasis on strict contractual terms).  
  - Reducing the seller’s exposure post-closing, which buyers may accept in exchange for stronger remedies (e.g., specific performance) for breaches of the few surviving warranties.  

### Why Buyers Might Favor This:  
While disclaimer clauses are typically seller-friendly, a buyer might negotiate this structure to:  
- **Simplify disputes** by narrowing warranties to only those explicitly agreed.  
- **Align with due diligence** (if the buyer has verified key representations in Section 7.1 and prefers certainty over vague implied terms).  
- **Support enforceability** (clear disclaimers reduce ambiguity, making breaches easier to prove if they occur within the limited warranties).  

**Bottom Line:** This clause is buyer-favorable in a transactional context where the buyer prioritizes **precision** over broad protections and has negotiated robust remedies for the few surviving warranties (e.g., indemnification or specific performance).",5

Here’s how it aligns with the query and the external context:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties**:  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims **all warranties not expressly stated in the agreement**, including implied warranties like **merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and industry-standard warranties**.  
   - This is **buyer-favorable** because it limits the seller’s liability and ensures the buyer is not relying on unwritten promises or assumptions.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**:  
   - The clause negates warranties that might otherwise arise from **course of dealing, performance, or industry usage**, which could otherwise create unintended obligations for the seller.  
   - This protects the buyer from vague or subjective claims about expected performance.

3. **Alignment with External Context**:  
   - The external references (e.g., *M&A clauses*) discuss **conditions where representations/warranties must be true at closing**.  
   - Your clause complements this by clarifying that **only the warranties explicitly stated in the agreement apply**, preventing the seller from being held to broader, unstated standards.  

### Why This is Buyer-Favorable:
- **Certainty**: The buyer knows exactly which warranties apply (only those written in the contract).  
- **Risk Mitigation**: The buyer avoids liability for claims based on implied terms or industry practices.  
- **Negotiation Leverage**: If the buyer wants specific protections, they can insist on **express warranties** (e.g., in a separate section) while keeping the disclaimer broad.  

### Suggested Improvement for Even More Buyer-Favorability:
If the buyer wants **stronger protection**, they could:  
- **Carve out specific warranties** (e.g., ""Except as stated in **Section X**, no other warranties apply"").  
- **Require survival periods** for key warranties (as seen in the external M&A examples).  

In summary, this clause is **buyer-favorable** because it narrowly defines enforceable warranties, reducing ambiguity and liability risks. The external context reinforces that warranties should be **explicitly stated and time-bound**, which aligns with this disclaimer’s purpose.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.","The clause you provided is a **warranty disclaimer**, which is highly relevant to the query about **buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses**. Here’s why:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties**  
   - The clause states that **neither party** makes any representations or warranties **except those expressly stated in the agreement**.  
   - This means that unless a warranty is explicitly written in the contract, no other warranties (express or implied) apply.  

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims common implied warranties, including:  
     - **Merchantability** (the product is fit for ordinary use)  
     - **Fitness for a Particular Purpose** (the product meets the buyer’s specific needs)  
     - **Non-Infringement** (the product does not violate third-party rights)  
   - This is a strong limitation on the seller’s liability.  

3. **Buyer-Favorable Implications**  
   - If the buyer wants **stronger protections**, they would negotiate to:  
     - **Narrow the disclaimer** (e.g., only disclaim implied warranties, not express ones).  
     - **Include specific survival clauses** (e.g., certain warranties remain valid post-closing).  
     - **Carve out exceptions** (e.g., warranties related to title, intellectual property, or compliance with laws).  
   - The external references (from MAUD) show how **representations and warranties** can be **conditionally limited** (e.g., only certain sections must remain true at closing).  

### **Why This Matters for a Buyer-Favorable Approach:**
- A buyer would **push back** on overly broad disclaimers to ensure they have recourse if the product/service fails to meet expectations.  
- They might **demand specific warranties** (e.g., quality, performance, regulatory compliance) that survive the disclaimer.  
- The external examples suggest that in M&A deals, buyers often **condition the deal** on key reps & warranties being true at closing—meaning they don’t allow a blanket disclaimer to override critical assurances.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause is a **standard, seller-friendly disclaimer**, but a buyer would seek modifications to ensure they retain legal protections. The external references highlight how buyers structure agreements to **preserve key warranties** despite general disclaimers.

However, it does contain elements that could be relevant to a **buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer** analysis. Here's how it relates to the query:

### Key Aspects Relevant to Buyer-Favorable Warranty Disclaimers:
1. **Limited Warranty Authority for Reseller (Buyer)**  
   - The clause prohibits the Reseller (buyer) from making any representations or warranties about the Company's products unless explicitly authorized in writing by the Company.  
   - This is **seller-favorable** because it restricts the buyer's ability to make promises about the product, reducing the seller's liability.  

2. **Indemnification in Favor of the Reseller (Buyer)**  
   - If the Reseller complies with the disclaimer, the **Company must indemnify the Reseller** for losses related to the products.  
   - This is **buyer-favorable** because it provides the buyer (Reseller) with financial protection if the product causes issues (e.g., defects leading to third-party claims).  

3. **Reciprocal Indemnification (Balanced Risk Allocation)**  
   - The Reseller must also indemnify the Company for losses caused by the Reseller’s activities.  
   - While this is neutral, the fact that the buyer gets indemnification from the seller is somewhat favorable.  

### Comparison to External References:  
The external clauses (from MAUD samples) discuss **conditions where representations and warranties must be true at key deal stages** (e.g., Expiration Time, Offer consummation). Your clause differs because:  
- It **disclaims warranties** rather than conditioning them.  
- It **shifts liability via indemnification**, which can be buyer-favorable if the seller assumes responsibility for product defects.  

### Is This Clause Buyer-Favorable?  
- **Not strongly buyer-favorable**—it primarily protects the seller by restricting warranties.  
- **Somewhat buyer-favorable** due to the indemnification provision shielding the Reseller from product-related losses.  
- For a **more buyer-friendly warranty disclaimer**, you might want:  
  - Broader exceptions allowing the buyer to make certain warranties.  
  - Stronger indemnification language (e.g., uncapped liability for the seller).  
  - Survival of warranties beyond the transaction closing.

indemnity or indemnification clause,a891976062,"11. Indemnity (a) Rights of Indemnity (1) The Corporation covenants and agrees to protect, indemnify, and save harmless, each of the Agents and their respective affiliates, and each and every one of the directors, officers, employees, partners and agents of the Agents (individually, an ""Indemnified Party"" and collectively, the ""Indemnified Parties"") harmless from and against any and all expenses, losses (excluding loss of profits), claims, actions, damages (other than consequential or punitive damages) or liabilities, joint or several (including the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any actions, suits, proceedings or claims and the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel that may be incurred in advising with respect to and/or defending any claim that may be made against the Indemnified Parties) to which any Indemnified Party may become subject or otherwise involved in any capacity under any statute or common law or otherwise insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based, directly or indirectly, upon the performance of professional services rendered to the Corporation by the Indemnified Parties (or any of them), whether directly or indirectly, including by reason of: (a) any information or statement contained in this Agreement, the Corporation's publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the Corporation used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the Corporation delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto, which at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made contains or is alleged to contain a misrepresentation or any misstatement of a material fact;
(b) the omission or alleged omission to state in in this Agreement, the Corporation's publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the Corporation used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the Corporation delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which it was made; (c) any order made, or inquiry, investigation or proceeding commenced by any securities regulatory authority or other competent authority based upon any misrepresentation, untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission in this Agreement, the Corporation's publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the Corporation used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the Corporation delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto that prevents or restricts the trading in any of the Corporation's securities or the distribution or distribution to the public, as the case may be, of any of the Offered Shares in any of the Qualifying Jurisdictions; (d) the Corporation not complying with any requirement of Applicable Securities Laws or stock exchange requirements in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, including the Corporation's non-compliance with any statutory requirement to make any document available for inspection; or (e) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Corporation contained in this Agreement or the failure of the Corporation to comply with any of its obligations hereunder. (2) Notwithstanding Subsection 11(a) (1), the indemnification in Subsection 11(a)(1) does not and shall not apply to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment that has become non- appealable shall determine that (a) the Agents and their respective affiliates have been negligent or have committed any fraudulent or illegal act in the course of the professional services rendered to the Corporation, and (b) such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions were caused or incurred by the gross negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of the Agents. (3) If any matter or thing contemplated by this Section 11 shall be asserted against any Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such Indemnified Party will notify the Corporation in writing as soon as possible of the nature of such claim (provided that omission to so notify the Corporation will not relieve the Corporation of any liability that it may otherwise have to the Indemnified Party hereunder, except to the extent the Corporation is materially prejudiced by such omission) and the Corporation shall be entitled (but not required) to assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such claim; provided, however, that the defence shall be through legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and that no settlement may be made by the Corporation or such Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
(4) In any such claim, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain other legal counsel to act on such Indemnified Party's behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such other legal counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party, unless: (a) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Corporation; or (b) the Corporation has not assumed the defence and employed counsel thereof promptly after receiving notice of such claim; or (c) the named parties to any such claim include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation, and the Indemnified Party has been advised by legal counsel thereto that representation of both the Corporation and the Indemnified Party by the same legal counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them; or (d) there are one or more defences available to the Indemnified Party which are different from and in addition to those available to the Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties. (5) To the extent that any Indemnified Party is not a party to this Underwriting Agreement, the Agents shall obtain and hold the right and benefit of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party. (6) The Corporation hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in any court in which any claim that is subject to indemnification hereunder is brought against the Agents or any Indemnified Party and to the assignment of the benefit of this Section 11 to any Indemnified Party for the purpose of enforcement provided that nothing herein shall limit the Corporation's right or ability to contest the appropriate jurisdiction or forum for the determination of any such claims. (7) The rights of the Corporation contained in this Section 11 shall not enure to the benefit of any Indemnified Party if the Agents were provided with a copy of any amendment or supplement to this Agreement which corrects any untrue statement or omission or alleged omission that is the basis of a claim by a party against such Indemnified Party and that is required, under the Applicable Securities Laws, to be delivered to such party by the Agents. (8) The Corporation shall not be liable under this Section 11 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its prior written consent.
(b) Notification of Claims If any matter or thing contemplated by Section 11(a) (any such matter or thing being referred to as a ""Claim"") is asserted against any person or company in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such person or company (the ""Indemnified Party"") will notify the Corporation as soon as possible of the nature of such Claim (but the omission so to notify the Corporation of any potential Claim shall not relieve the Corporation from any liability which they may have to any Indemnified Party and any omission so to notify the Corporation of any actual Claim shall affect the Corporation's liability only to the extent that the Corporation is materially prejudiced by that failure). The Corporation shall assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such Claim, provided, however, that (i) the defence shall be conducted through legal counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, and (ii) no settlement of any such Claim or admission of liability may be made by the Corporation without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. (c) Right of Indemnity in Favour of Others With respect to any Indemnified Party who is not a party to this Agreement, the Agents shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party. (d) Retaining Counsel In any such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain one separate counsel to act on his or its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of the other counsel; (ii) the named parties to any such Claim (including any added third or impleaded party) include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel to the Indemnified Party that the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Corporation and the Indemnified Party; or (iii) the Corporation shall not have retained counsel within seven Business Days following receipt by the Corporation of notice of any such Claim from the Indemnified Party; provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties.","The **indemnity clause** (Section 11) in the provided contract is directly responsive to the query about **indemnity or indemnification clauses**. Here’s how it aligns with the query and its key features:

### **Relevance to the Query**  
1. **Core Purpose**:  
   - The clause establishes the **Corporation’s obligation to indemnify** the Agents and their affiliates (the ""Indemnified Parties"") against specified losses, expenses, claims, or liabilities arising from their professional services to the Corporation.  
   - This is a classic example of an **indemnification clause**, which shifts financial risk from one party (the Agents) to another (the Corporation) for certain liabilities.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**:  
   - Covers a broad range of scenarios, including:  
     - Misrepresentations or omissions in the Agreement or public filings (e.g., SEDAR documents).  
     - Regulatory investigations or non-compliance with securities laws.  
     - Breaches of the Corporation’s representations/warranties.  
   - Excludes indemnification for losses caused by the Agents’ **gross negligence, fraud, or wilful misconduct** (Subsection 11(a)(2)), a standard carve-out in indemnity clauses.

3. **Procedural Safeguards**:  
   - **Notice Requirements**: The Indemnified Party must notify the Corporation of claims promptly (though failure to do so only prejudices the Corporation if material harm results).  
   - **Defense Control**: The Corporation may assume the defense of claims but must use counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Party and cannot settle without consent (unless the settlement fully releases the Indemnified Party).  
   - **Separate Counsel**: The Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel at their own expense, unless conflicts of interest or the Corporation’s delay justify the Corporation covering fees (Subsection 11(a)(4) and (d)).

4. **Third-Party Rights**:  
   - Extends indemnity benefits to non-parties (e.g., directors, officers) via a **trust mechanism** (Subsection 11(a)(5) and (c)), ensuring broader protection.  

5. **Jurisdictional Consent**:  
   - The Corporation consents to personal jurisdiction in courts where claims against Indemnified Parties are brought (Subsection 11(a)(6)), streamlining enforcement.  

### **Connection to External Information**  
While the external excerpts focus on **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) and jurisdiction, the indemnity clause complements these by addressing **monetary compensation** for losses. Together, they form a comprehensive risk-allocation framework:  
- The indemnity clause covers **financial liabilities**.  
- The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102) address **non-monetary breaches** (e.g., specific performance).  

### **Key Takeaways**  
This indemnity clause is **highly relevant** to the query because it:  
- Defines **who is protected** (Indemnified Parties) and **what risks are covered**.  
- Balances rights (e.g., defense control) with limitations (e.g., exclusions for misconduct).  
- Aligns with broader contractual risk-management strategies, as seen in the external context.

Each Party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their respective employees directors, officers, agents and successors (collectively, the ""Indemnified Parties"") from and against any and all losses (including all costs, liabilities (including present and future damages), claims and expenses) incurred or suffered by any of the Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising out of, relating to or resulting from (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement; or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement.","The **indemnification clause** (Section 10.1) in the provided contract is directly responsive to your query about **indemnity or indemnification clauses**. Here’s how it aligns with the query and its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Purpose of Indemnification**:  
   - The clause establishes a legal obligation for one party (the **Indemnifying Party**) to compensate and protect the other party (the **Indemnified Parties**) against specified losses. This is the core function of an indemnity clause—shifting liability for certain risks.

2. **Scope of Coverage**:  
   - The indemnity covers losses arising from:  
     - **Breach of the Agreement** (e.g., failure to fulfill contractual obligations).  
     - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (intentional or reckless actions).  
   - This ensures protection against both contractual violations and egregious conduct.

3. **Protected Parties**:  
   - Extends beyond the immediate parties to include **Affiliates, employees, directors, officers, and successors**, broadening the scope of protection.

4. **Types of Losses Covered**:  
   - Explicitly includes **costs, liabilities, claims, and expenses** (e.g., legal fees, damages), which is typical of indemnification clauses.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause directly addresses **indemnification** by defining:  
  - **Who is protected** (Indemnified Parties).  
  - **Who is liable** (Indemnifying Party).  
  - **What triggers indemnity** (breach, gross negligence, or willful misconduct).  
  - **What losses are recoverable** (financial and legal impacts).  

### Connection to External Information:
While the external excerpts focus on **enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches, the indemnification clause complements these by providing **financial recourse**. Together, they form a comprehensive risk-management framework:  
- **Enforcement clauses** (like those in the external info) allow parties to seek court orders to compel performance or prevent breaches.  
- **Indemnification clauses** (like Section 10.1) ensure monetary compensation for losses if breaches occur.  

### Why It Matters:
This clause is critical for allocating risk between parties, ensuring that harmed parties are made whole for losses caused by the other party’s failures or misconduct. It is a standard but vital component of contracts, particularly in high-stakes agreements (e.g., mergers, partnerships).

indemnity or indemnification clause,6febf32b96,"10. INDEMNIFICATION
10.1 Indemnification. Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their
respective employees, directors, officers, agents and successors (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all losses (including all costs,
liabilities (including present and future damages), claims and expenses) incurred or suffered by any of the Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising
out of, relating to or resulting from (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement; or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement.","The **indemnification clause** (Section 10.1) in your contract is directly responsive to the query about **indemnity or indemnification**. Here’s how it aligns with the query and its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Purpose of Indemnification**:  
   - The clause obligates one party (the **Indemnifying Party**) to compensate the other party (the **Indemnified Parties**) for losses arising from:  
     - **Breaches of the agreement** (e.g., failure to perform obligations).  
     - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (intentional or reckless actions).  
   - This protects the non-breaching party from financial harm caused by the other party’s actions or failures.

2. **Scope of Protection**:  
   - Covers not just the other party but also its **Affiliates, employees, directors, etc.**, broadening the protective reach.  
   - Includes **all losses, costs, liabilities, claims, and expenses**, ensuring comprehensive coverage.  

3. **Link to External Context**:  
   - The external information (Sections 10.12 from MAUD) discusses **enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches.  
   - The indemnification clause **complements these remedies** by addressing **monetary compensation** for damages, while the external clauses focus on **equitable relief** (e.g., court orders to enforce performance).  
   - Together, they form a robust framework:  
     - **Indemnification** covers financial losses.  
     - **Specific performance/injunctions** (from external clauses) address non-monetary breaches (e.g., forcing a party to complete the merger).  

### Why It’s Relevant to the Query:
- The clause **defines the indemnity obligations** explicitly, answering the query about how indemnification is structured.  
- It shows **when indemnity applies** (breach, negligence) and **what costs are recoverable**, which is central to understanding indemnification in contracts.  
- The external context highlights that indemnification is **one part of a broader enforcement strategy**, alongside legal remedies like injunctions.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Allocation**: The Indemnifying Party assumes liability for its actions/omissions.  
- **Legal Recourse**: Indemnified Parties can seek compensation without proving actual damages (per the external clauses’ waiver of bond requirements).  

In summary, this clause is a **core indemnification provision** that works alongside equitable remedies (like those in the external excerpts) to protect parties from contractual breaches or misconduct.",5

Here’s how it aligns with the query and its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Indemnification Clause:
1. **Scope of Indemnity**:  
   - The clause defines the obligations of the **Indemnifying Party** (the party providing indemnity) to cover claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including legal costs) arising from its **negligent acts or omissions**, breaches of the agreement, or actions of its subcontractors/agents.  
   - It excludes liability for losses caused by the **sole negligence** of the Indemnified Party.

2. **Procedural Requirements**:  
   - The Indemnified Party must **promptly notify** the Indemnifying Party of any claim and allow them a **reasonable opportunity to settle or defend** it.  
   - If the Indemnifying Party fails to act, the Indemnified Party may step in to settle/defend the claim **at the Indemnifying Party’s risk and expense**.

3. **Survival and Binding Effect**:  
   - The clause binds **successors, assigns, and heirs**, ensuring the indemnity obligations endure beyond the original parties.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause is a **standard indemnification provision**, addressing:  
  - **Financial protection** against third-party claims or breaches.  
  - **Allocation of risk** between parties (e.g., excluding sole negligence of the Indemnified Party).  
  - **Procedural safeguards** (notice, defense control, and participation rights).  

- While the **external information** (Sections 8.5 and 7.11) discusses **specific performance** and **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions for breaches), the indemnification clause focuses on **monetary compensation** for losses. The two concepts are complementary:  
  - **Indemnification** covers financial harm.  
  - **Specific performance** (from external clauses) addresses non-monetary breaches where damages are inadequate.  

### Practical Implications:
- The clause ensures that parties are **not left uncompensated** for losses caused by the other party’s negligence or breach.  
- It balances rights (e.g., defense participation) and obligations (e.g., prompt notice), reducing disputes over indemnity processes.  

In summary, this clause is a **core example of an indemnification provision**, directly answering the query by detailing the **who, what, and how** of indemnity in contractual relationships. The external clauses, while related to remedies, highlight broader enforcement mechanisms that may interact with indemnity in practice.",5
indemnity or indemnification clause,748fd40472,"12. Indemnity and Liability
12.1 Each Party (""""Indemnitor"""") will defend, indemnify and hold the other Party (including associated officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and affiliates) (cumulatively, """"Indemnitee"""") harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees), suffered or incurred as a result of or in connection with any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding brought against Indemnitee based upon (a) a claim of a failure to perform, or a breach by Indemnitor of, any obligation, warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; (b) a claim of personal injury or property damage arising out of the fault or negligence of Indemnitor, its representatives, agents, or employees; or (c) a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right held by any third party.","The **indemnity clause (Section 12.1)** you provided is directly responsive to the query about **""indemnity or indemnification clauses""**, as it outlines the obligations of one party (the **Indemnitor**) to compensate and protect the other party (the **Indemnitee**) against specific types of claims or losses. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Elements of the Indemnity Clause:
1. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - The Indemnitor agrees to **defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the Indemnitee against losses arising from:  
     - **Breach of contract** (failure to perform obligations under the agreement).  
     - **Tort claims** (personal injury/property damage due to negligence).  
     - **Intellectual property infringement** (third-party claims over patents, trademarks, etc.).  

2. **Covered Parties**:  
   - Extends protection not just to the other party but also to its **affiliates, employees, and agents**.  

3. **Financial Protections**:  
   - Covers **legal fees, damages, and other expenses** tied to claims, ensuring the Indemnitee isn’t financially burdened by covered risks.  

### Connection to the External Information:  
While the external excerpts focus on **enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctions for breaches) and jurisdiction (Delaware courts), they complement the indemnity clause by addressing **remedies** when breaches occur. Notably:  
- The indemnity clause **allocates liability** for specific harms (e.g., negligence, IP infringement).  
- The external clauses emphasize **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) when monetary damages (like indemnification) might be insufficient to address breaches.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
The indemnity clause is a **risk-shifting tool**, ensuring one party bears the costs of certain third-party claims or breaches. It answers the query by:  
- Defining **what** is indemnified (e.g., breaches, negligence).  
- Clarifying **who** is protected (Indemnitee and its affiliates).  
- Aligning with broader contract enforcement principles (as seen in the external snippets, where remedies like injunctions backstop indemnification).  

In summary, this clause is a **core example** of an indemnification provision, addressing liability allocation—while the external context highlights how courts might enforce such obligations.",5
mutual indemnification provisions,b961c3c348,"7. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party (the ""Indemnified Party"") from and against any and all claims, damages, and liabilities, including any and all expense and costs, legal or otherwise, caused by the negligent act or omission of the Indemnifying Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees, incurred by the Indemnified Party in the investigation and defense of any claim, demand, or action arising out of the work performed under this Agreement; including breach of the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claims, damages, or liabilities caused by the sole negligence of the Indemnified Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees. The Indemnified Party shall notify promptly the Indemnifying Party of the existence of any claim, demand, or other matter to which the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations would apply, and shall give them a reasonable opportunity to settle or defend the same at their own expense and with counsel of their own selection, provided that the Indemnified Party shall at all times also have the right to fully participate in the defense.

The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Article shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, and heirs of the Parties.","The **mutual indemnification provisions** in the clause you provided establish a reciprocal obligation between both parties (referred to as the ""Indemnifying Party"" and the ""Indemnified Party"") to protect each other from certain liabilities arising from their actions or omissions under the agreement. Here’s how this clause is relevant to your query:

### Key Aspects of Mutual Indemnification:
1. **Reciprocal Protection**:  
   - Each party agrees to indemnify the other for claims, damages, or liabilities caused by its **negligent acts or omissions** (including those of its subcontractors, agents, or employees).  
   - This mutual obligation ensures neither party bears undue risk for the other’s negligence or breaches.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - Covers **claims, legal costs, and expenses** arising from work performed under the agreement, including breaches of the agreement itself.  
   - Excludes liability for **sole negligence** of the Indemnified Party (e.g., if one party is entirely at fault, they cannot claim indemnification).

3. **Procedural Safeguards**:  
   - **Notice Requirement**: The Indemnified Party must promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of claims to trigger defense/settlement rights.  
   - **Defense Control**: The Indemnifying Party has the primary right to settle or defend claims (with counsel of their choice), but the Indemnified Party may step in if the Indemnifying Party fails to act.  
   - **Participation Rights**: The Indemnified Party retains the right to participate in the defense, ensuring transparency.

4. **Survival & Binding Effect**:  
   - The obligations endure for **successors, assigns, and heirs**, ensuring continuity of protection even if parties transfer rights.

### Connection to External Information:  
The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **7.11**) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches, noting monetary damages may be inadequate. While those sections address **enforcement mechanisms**, your indemnification clause focuses on **financial protection** against specific risks (negligence, third-party claims). Together, they create a layered framework:  
- **Indemnification** compensates for actual losses (e.g., legal costs).  
- **Equitable remedies** (from external clauses) address breaches where money alone isn’t sufficient (e.g., forcing compliance with terms).  

### Why It Matters for Your Query:  
This clause exemplifies **mutual indemnification** by:  
- Balancing risk allocation between parties.  
- Defining triggers (negligence/breach), exclusions (sole negligence), and processes (notice, defense rights).  
- Complementing broader enforcement tools (like specific performance) referenced in the external clauses.

mutual indemnification provisions,eb53e37b8b,"25. Indemnification. The Parties shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other, their heirs, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, expenses, causes of action, suits, claims, and judgments of any kind or character for injury to person or property arising in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT, whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise.","The **mutual indemnification provision** in Clause 25 is directly responsive to your query about **mutual indemnification provisions** in contracts. Here’s how it aligns with the query and the broader context:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Obligation**:  
   - Both parties agree to **indemnify, hold harmless, and defend** each other (and their successors/assigns). This reciprocity ensures neither party bears disproportionate risk for losses arising from the agreement.

2. **Scope of Coverage**:  
   - Covers **all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney’s fees, etc.**, tied to injuries or property damage stemming from the agreement’s responsibilities.  
   - Explicitly includes claims **arising from negligence** (e.g., ""whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise""), which broadens protection beyond intentional acts.

3. **Relevance to External Context**:  
   - While the external excerpts focus on **specific performance** (equitable remedies for breaches), Clause 25 complements them by addressing **financial compensation** for losses.  
   - Together, these provisions create a layered enforcement framework:  
     - **Specific performance** (from external clauses) compels compliance with the agreement.  
     - **Indemnification** (Clause 25) compensates for actual damages incurred due to breaches or negligence.  

4. **Risk Allocation**:  
   - The clause ensures that liabilities are shared fairly, discouraging reckless behavior by holding each party accountable for their role in causing harm.  

### Why It Matters for Your Query:  
- This is a classic **mutual indemnification** clause, balancing risk between parties. It contrasts with one-sided indemnification (where only one party bears liability).  
- The inclusion of negligence underscores its breadth, making it robust for scenarios where fault is disputed.  
- When read alongside the external excerpts, it shows how contracts combine **equitable remedies** (like injunctions) with **monetary protections** (indemnification) to address breaches holistically.  

**Practical Impact**: If a party’s negligence causes harm (e.g., a data breach under the agreement), the other party can seek indemnification for losses *and* potentially demand specific performance to stop ongoing harm.",5
mutual indemnification provisions,988610fe80,"Section 9.1 Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX, each Party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the ""Indemnified Parties"") from and against all Losses imposed upon or incurred by an Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of or resulting from the Indemnifying Party's or its Affiliates' material breach of this Agreement, except to the extent that such Losses are primarily caused by the Indemnified Party.","The **mutual indemnification provision** in **Section 9.1** is directly relevant to the query because it establishes a reciprocal obligation between the parties to compensate each other for losses arising from a **material breach of the agreement**. Here’s how it connects to the query and the external context:

### Key Aspects of the Indemnification Clause:
1. **Mutual Obligation**:  
   - Both parties (referred to as the ""Indemnifying Party"") agree to indemnify each other, their affiliates, and related persons (""Indemnified Parties"") for losses caused by their own **material breach** of the agreement.  
   - This ensures neither party bears the financial burden of the other’s contractual violations.

2. **Scope of Coverage**:  
   - Covers **""Losses""** (e.g., damages, legal costs) arising from breaches, unless the Indemnified Party is **primarily responsible** for those losses.  
   - Aligns with the external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_630) that emphasize remedies for breaches, including equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) when monetary compensation is insufficient.

3. **Link to External Context**:  
   - The external clauses highlight that breaches may cause **""irreparable harm""** where monetary damages alone are inadequate. The indemnification clause complements this by addressing **financial redress** for provable losses.  
   - Together, these provisions create a layered enforcement framework:  
     - **Equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) to prevent or stop breaches.  
     - **Indemnification** to recover monetary losses after a breach occurs.  

4. **Limitations**:  
   - The phrase **""subject to the limitations in this Article IX""** suggests carve-outs (e.g., caps, exclusions) that balance the parties’ risks.  
   - Contrasts with the external clauses’ focus on **non-monetary remedies**, showing how indemnification and equitable relief work in tandem.

### Why It Matters for the Query:  
The clause exemplifies a **mutual indemnification** structure by:  
- Ensuring both parties share liability for breaches.  
- Addressing financial consequences while external clauses (MAUD_102/630) address non-monetary enforcement.  
- Reflecting standard risk allocation in contracts, where indemnification is a key tool alongside equitable remedies.  

In summary, this indemnification clause is a **critical component** of mutual protection in the agreement, working alongside equitable remedies to provide comprehensive breach-related recourse.",5
mutual indemnification provisions,94ea6e0069,"11. Indemnification and Insurance. 11.1. Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party, and its directors, officers, employees and agents, from and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs (collectively, ""Liabilities""), resulting from any claims, demands, actions or other proceedings by any third party to the extent resulting from the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by the breaching party under this Agreement.","The clause you provided is a **mutual indemnification provision**, which directly addresses your query. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of mutual indemnification and why it’s relevant:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Obligation**:  
   - The clause binds **both parties** (not just one) to indemnify each other, creating a reciprocal obligation. This is the hallmark of mutual indemnification.  

2. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - It covers losses resulting from third-party claims due to breaches of **representations, warranties, or covenants** under the agreement. This ensures both parties are protected against liabilities arising from the other’s failures.  

3. **Protected Parties**:  
   - Extends protection not only to the indemnified party but also to its **directors, officers, employees, and agents**, broadening the safeguard.  

4. **Covered Liabilities**:  
   - Explicitly includes **legal fees and costs**, ensuring full financial protection for disputes tied to breaches.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause exemplifies a **balanced, bilateral indemnification** structure, where both parties share the risk of third-party claims caused by breaches.  
- It contrasts with one-sided indemnification (where only one party bears liability), demonstrating fairness in risk allocation.  

### Connection to External Context:  
While the external excerpts focus on **specific performance** (a remedy for breaches), your clause complements them by addressing **financial recourse** (indemnification) for third-party claims. Together, they form a comprehensive risk-management framework:  
- **Specific performance** (external info): Ensures contractual obligations are fulfilled.  
- **Indemnification** (your clause): Compensates for losses if breaches occur.  

### Why This Matters:  
Mutual indemnification provisions like this are critical in contracts to:  
- Ensure neither party is unfairly exposed to third-party risks.  
- Encourage compliance with representations/warranties.  
- Align with remedies like specific performance (as seen in the external excerpts) to provide layered protection.

mutual indemnification provisions,26bb91b293,"5. Indemnification. 5.1 Indemnification. Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, ""Indemnified Party"") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, ""Losses""), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent.","The **mutual indemnification provisions** query seeks information on clauses where both parties in an agreement agree to indemnify each other under certain conditions. The provided **Clause 5.1** is a **unilateral indemnification provision**, where only the **Provider** indemnifies the **Recipient** (and its related parties) for losses arising from the Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of the agreement.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Indemnification Structure** – While the clause is not mutual (only one party provides indemnification), it illustrates key elements of indemnification, such as:  
   - **Scope of Indemnification** (covering third-party claims and direct claims from Recipient).  
   - **Covered Losses** (including legal fees, settlements, and enforcement costs).  
   - **Conditions & Limitations** (e.g., no settlement without consent).  

2. **Comparison to Mutual Indemnification** – A mutual indemnification clause would extend similar obligations to **both parties**, ensuring reciprocal protection (e.g., Recipient would also indemnify Provider under specified circumstances).  

3. **Link to External Clauses** – The external excerpts (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **7.11**) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief**, which often complement indemnification by allowing courts to enforce contractual obligations beyond monetary damages. While not directly about indemnification, these clauses highlight remedies that may apply if indemnification fails (e.g., injunctions for breach).  

### Suggested Enhancements for Mutual Indemnification:  
To align with the query, the clause could be modified to include:  
- **Reciprocal obligations** (e.g., ""Recipient shall indemnify Provider for losses arising from Recipient’s breach or misconduct"").  
- **Carve-outs** (e.g., exclusions for gross negligence or intentional acts).  
- **Procedural safeguards** (e.g., notice requirements, defense control).  

In summary, while Clause 5.1 is not mutual, it provides a foundation for drafting mutual indemnification terms by outlining key indemnity mechanics. The external clauses further contextualize enforcement mechanisms that may interplay with indemnification rights.

unilateral indemnification clause,32762b4bf5,"ARTICLE 9 - INDEMNIFICATION
Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The **unilateral indemnification clause** in the provided agreement (Section 9.1) establishes a **mutual indemnification obligation**, meaning both parties agree to indemnify each other under specified conditions. However, the relevance to your query lies in how the clause structures indemnification rights and procedures, which can be analyzed for unilateral implications or asymmetries. Here’s how:

### Key Aspects Relevant to Unilateral Indemnification:
1. **Mutual vs. Unilateral Nature**:  
   - While the clause is framed as mutual (both parties indemnify each other), certain provisions create **unilateral control** in specific scenarios. For example:  
     - The **indemnifying party** (obligor) has the **exclusive right to control defense/settlement** of claims (Section 9.1(b)(1)), unless they decline to act (Section 9.1(b)(4)).  
     - The **indemnitee** (beneficiary) can act unilaterally only if the indemnifying party fails to respond or contests its obligation.  

2. **Unilateral Settlement Rights**:  
   - The indemnifying party may settle a claim **without the indemnitee’s consent** under certain conditions (e.g., payment of money damages only, no admission of wrongdoing) (Section 9.1(b)(3)).  
   - Conversely, the indemnitee may also settle unilaterally if the indemnifying party refuses to act, subject to similar limitations (Section 9.1(b)(4)).  

3. **Procedural Asymmetry**:  
   - The clause imposes **stricter notice and cooperation requirements on the indemnitee** (e.g., detailed Claims Notice, cooperation in defense), while the indemnifying party retains decision-making authority.  

4. **Equitable Relief Context (External Information)**:  
   - The external references (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_446) highlight that parties may seek **specific performance** or injunctive relief for breaches. This could interact with indemnification by allowing unilateral enforcement if monetary remedies are inadequate (e.g., to compel indemnification).  

### Why This Matters for ""Unilateral Indemnification"":  
- The clause is not purely unilateral but contains **unilateral elements** in control, settlement, and enforcement.  
- It reflects a common structure where indemnification is mutual, but **procedural mechanisms** (e.g., defense control, settlement rights) may favor one party in practice.  
- If your query seeks a **fully unilateral clause** (where only one party provides indemnity), this example would need modification to remove reciprocity.  

### Suggested Refinement for a Fully Unilateral Clause:  
To draft a **truly unilateral indemnification clause**, you would:  
1. Limit indemnification obligations to **one party only** (e.g., ""Party A shall indemnify Party B, but not vice versa"").  
2. Specify that **only the indemnitee** (beneficiary) controls defense/settlement.  
3. Exclude mutual procedural requirements (e.g., unilateral notice rights).

However, the clause you provided (**Section 25. Indemnification**) is actually a **mutual indemnification clause**, as it states that **""The Parties shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other...""**, meaning both parties have reciprocal obligations to indemnify one another.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Comparison with Unilateral Indemnification**  
   - A unilateral clause would apply to only one party (e.g., *""Party A shall indemnify Party B...""*).  
   - Your clause is **mutual**, meaning both parties share indemnification responsibilities.  

2. **Key Elements of the Clause**  
   - **Scope:** Covers losses, liabilities, damages, attorney fees, etc., arising from the agreement.  
   - **Covered Parties:** Extends to heirs, successors, and assigns.  
   - **Negligence Coverage:** Explicitly includes indemnification even if harm is due to a party’s negligence.  

3. **Connection to External References**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **7.11**) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief** (like injunctions) for breaches.  
   - While your indemnification clause focuses on **financial compensation**, the external clauses emphasize **court-enforced performance** when monetary damages are insufficient.  
   - Together, they show a contract structure where:  
     - Indemnification covers monetary losses.  
     - Equitable remedies (like injunctions) address breaches where money alone isn’t enough.  

### **Conclusion:**  
Your clause is **not unilateral** but **mutual**. If you need a unilateral version, it should specify that only one party bears indemnification duties. The external clauses complement yours by addressing non-monetary remedies, ensuring comprehensive protection for both parties.

liabilities (including present and future damages), claims and expenses) incurred or suffered by any of the Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising
out of, relating to or resulting from (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement; or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement.","The clause you provided is a **mutual indemnification clause**, not a **unilateral indemnification clause**. Here’s the distinction and relevance to your query:

### **1. Unilateral vs. Mutual Indemnification**  
- **Unilateral Indemnification**: Only **one party** (the indemnifying party) agrees to indemnify the other, typically in situations where one party assumes greater risk (e.g., a vendor indemnifying a client).  
- **Mutual Indemnification**: **Both parties** agree to indemnify each other (as in your clause), which is common in agreements where both sides share potential liability.  

Your clause (Section 10.1) is **mutual** because it states:  
> *""Each Party (the 'Indemnifying Party') agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party...""*  

This means **both parties** have indemnification obligations, not just one.

### **2. Relevance to the Query**  
If you were looking for a **unilateral indemnification clause**, this clause does **not** fit because it imposes obligations on both parties. A unilateral version would apply to only one party, such as:  
> *""Party A shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Party B...""*  

### **3. Connection to External Information**  
The external excerpts (Sections 10.12 from MAUD_417 and MAUD_731) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not directly relate to indemnification. However, they reinforce that:  
- Courts may enforce contractual obligations (like indemnification) through injunctions or specific performance.  
- Indemnification clauses often work alongside dispute resolution mechanisms (like exclusive jurisdiction in Delaware).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
Your clause is a **mutual indemnification provision**, not unilateral. If you need a **unilateral** clause, it should be revised to bind only one party. The external context supports enforcement but does not alter the indemnification structure.

Here's the relevance to your query about a **unilateral indemnification clause**:

### Key Differences:
1. **Bilateral vs. Unilateral**:  
   - Your clause requires **both parties** to indemnify each other (mutual obligation).  
   - A **unilateral indemnification clause** would obligate **only one party** to indemnify the other (one-sided obligation).  

2. **Relevance to the Query**:  
   - The clause illustrates how indemnification works (definitions, scope, covered losses, and triggers like breach or misconduct).  
   - However, to make it unilateral, you would:  
     - Remove reciprocity (e.g., ""**Company A** agrees to indemnify **Company B**..."" without requiring Company B to indemnify Company A).  
     - Specify that only one party bears the indemnity burden (common in scenarios like vendor agreements or one-sided risk allocations).  

### External Context:  
The external snippets (about **specific performance** in Delaware courts) highlight enforcement mechanisms but don’t directly address indemnification. They could indirectly support a unilateral clause by emphasizing:  
   - A party’s right to enforce obligations (e.g., if only one party is bound to indemnify).  
   - The use of equitable remedies (like injunctions) to ensure compliance with indemnification terms.  

### Suggested Unilateral Language:  
To convert your clause to unilateral, revise it to:  
> *""**[Indemnifying Party]** agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless **[Indemnified Party]**... [rest of clause as written, but apply only to one party].""*

However, the provided clause (**Sections 6.1 and 6.2**) is **mutual/bilateral**, as both parties (Owner and Operator) agree to indemnify each other under specified conditions.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Comparison to Unilateral Indemnification**:  
   - A unilateral clause would involve only one party (e.g., Owner indemnifying Operator, but not vice versa). Here, both parties assume indemnification obligations, making it mutual.  
   - The query might seek to contrast this with unilateral structures or identify scenarios where one-sided indemnification is preferable (e.g., in agreements with power imbalances).  

2. **Key Features Highlighted**:  
   - **Scope**: Each party indemnifies the other for breaches, negligence, or third-party claims, subject to carve-outs (e.g., no indemnity for the indemnitee’s own misconduct).  
   - **Symmetry**: The clauses mirror each other, ensuring reciprocity.  
   - **External Context**: The external information (specific performance clauses) underscores the parties’ intent to enforce obligations, which aligns with indemnification as a remedy for breaches.  

3. **Practical Implications**:  
   - If the query aims to draft a unilateral clause, this example demonstrates how to structure indemnity obligations but would require limiting it to one party.  
   - The mutual carve-outs (e.g., excluding indemnity for the indemnitee’s fraud) could still apply in a unilateral context.  

### Conclusion:  
While not unilateral, the clause illustrates how indemnification terms are drafted reciprocally. To address the query directly, you’d modify this structure to impose obligations on only one party, removing Section 6.2 (Operator’s indemnity) for a purely unilateral approach. The external information reinforces that indemnification ties into broader enforcement mechanisms (e.g., equitable relief for breaches).

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
- The clause explicitly covers **Third Party Claims** (defined as claims, actions, or proceedings by a third party).  
- **VS** agrees to indemnify PPD (and its affiliates, directors, officers, and employees) for claims arising from VS's:  
  - Negligence  
  - Intentional misconduct  
  - Breach of the Agreement  
- Conversely, **PPD** agrees to indemnify VS (and its directors, officers, and employees) for claims arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach.  

### **2. Defense and Control of Third-party Claims**  
- **Notice Requirement**: The indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party of any Third Party Claim.  
- **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party has the **right to control the defense and settlement** of the claim, provided they act reasonably and in good faith.  
- **Cooperation**: The indemnified party must reasonably cooperate in the defense.  
- **Right to Participate**: The indemnified party may join the defense with its own counsel, but at its own expense unless:  
  - The indemnifying party authorizes the expense, or  
  - The indemnifying party fails to assume the defense (in which case the indemnified party takes control).  

### **3. Relevance to the Query**  
The clause comprehensively addresses:  
- **When indemnification applies** (third-party claims due to negligence, misconduct, or breach).  
- **Who bears the liability** (the party at fault indemnifies the other).  
- **How claims are managed** (notice, defense control, settlement rules).  
- **Financial protections** (covering legal fees, costs, and liabilities).  

### **Connection to External Information**  
While the external references discuss **specific performance** (a remedy for breach, not indemnification), they reinforce the broader contractual principle that parties may seek **legal enforcement** (via injunctions or court orders) if obligations are breached. However, indemnification is distinct—it focuses on **financial protection** rather than compelled performance.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause is **highly relevant** to third-party claims because it:  
1. Defines indemnifiable scenarios (third-party claims).  
2. Allocates responsibility between the parties.  
3. Establishes procedural safeguards (notice, defense control).  
4. Ensures financial coverage for legal risks.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Definition of ""Claim""**:  
   - The clause defines a ""Claim"" as any claim, action, or proceeding by a third party (excluding affiliates), including governmental authorities. This directly addresses the query by clarifying what constitutes a third-party claim under the agreement.

2. **Indemnification Obligations (Section 7.2)**:  
   - The **Indemnifying Party** (the party responsible for indemnification) must:  
     - **Defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the **Indemnified Party** (and its affiliates) against claims, costs, losses, damages, etc., arising from third-party claims.  
     - Cover claims related to:  
       - The operation/content of the Indemnifying Party’s site (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
       - Products/services offered through the Indemnifying Party’s site (with exceptions for the Indemnified Party’s products).  
       - Breaches of representations/warranties or regulatory compliance obligations.  
       - Intellectual Property infringement by materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  
   - The Indemnifying Party must pay awards, costs, and attorneys' fees resulting from such claims, subject to procedural requirements (Section 7.3).  

3. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**:  
   - Limits liability for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) **unless** they arise from:  
     - A third-party judgment covered by indemnification under Section 7.2.  
     - A breach of confidentiality (Section 11.4).  
   - This reinforces that indemnification for third-party claims is a carve-out to the general exclusion of consequential damages.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **directly governs indemnification for third-party claims**, specifying:  
  - **Scope**: What types of third-party claims trigger indemnity (e.g., IP infringement, regulatory actions).  
  - **Process**: The Indemnifying Party’s duty to defend and pay for claims (subject to procedures).  
  - **Exceptions**: Consequential damages are excluded unless tied to an indemnifiable third-party claim.  
- The external information (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) underscores that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) may apply for breaches, but the indemnification clause here focuses on **monetary compensation** for third-party claims, which is distinct from equitable relief.  

### Practical Implications:
- A party seeking indemnification for a third-party claim must show the claim falls under one of the enumerated categories (e.g., site operation, product liability, IP infringement).  
- The clause balances risk allocation by ensuring third-party claims are covered while limiting exposure to indirect damages unless indemnification applies.  

In summary, this clause is a **comprehensive framework for indemnifying third-party claims**, defining responsibilities, exclusions, and the interplay with other liability provisions.",5

Subject to Section 7.3 [Procedure], the Indemnifying Party will pay any award against the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors or representatives) and any costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by them resulting from any such Claim.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims""** as it explicitly defines the scope, obligations, and procedures for indemnification in the context of claims brought by third parties. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Definition of ""Claim""**  
   - The clause defines **""Claim""** broadly to include any claim, action, or proceeding initiated by a third party (excluding affiliates of the parties), such as governmental authorities. This directly addresses the query by clarifying what constitutes a third-party claim under the agreement.

### 2. **Indemnification Obligations**  
   - The clause outlines the **indemnifying party's duty** to:  
     - **Defend**: Assume legal defense against third-party claims.  
     - **Indemnify and hold harmless**: Cover costs (e.g., damages, attorneys' fees) incurred by the indemnified party due to specified claims.  
   - This aligns with the query by detailing how third-party claims are financially and legally managed between the parties.

### 3. **Scope of Covered Claims**  
   The indemnity applies to claims arising from:  
   - **Operations/content of the indemnifying party’s site** (unless caused by the indemnified party).  
   - **Product sales/marketing** through the indemnifying party’s site (with exceptions for the indemnified party’s products).  
   - **Breach of representations/warranties** (Section 7.1) or regulatory obligations (Section 4.4 for Company).  
   - **Infringement of IP rights** by materials provided by the indemnifying party.  
   - This specificity answers the query by enumerating the scenarios where indemnification for third-party claims is triggered.

### 4. **Procedure and Limitations**  
   - The clause references **Section 7.3 (""Procedure"")**, which likely outlines steps for notifying and resolving claims (e.g., cooperation, settlement rights).  
   - It emphasizes that the indemnifying party must pay **awards, costs, and attorneys' fees** tied to the claim, reinforcing the financial protection against third-party actions.  

### 5. **Link to External Context**  
   The external information (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) highlights broader themes of **enforcement** and **equitable relief** for breaches, but your clause focuses narrowly on **third-party liability**. Together, they show:  
   - The indemnification clause is a **specific remedy** for third-party claims.  
   - The external sections address **breaches between the parties themselves**, whereas your clause deals with **external threats** (third-party claims).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause directly answers the query by:  
- Defining third-party claims (""Claim"").  
- Detailing indemnification obligations, including defense and cost coverage.  
- Listing the specific scenarios where indemnification applies.  
- Referencing procedural rules for handling such claims.  

It ensures that risks from third-party actions are allocated clearly between the parties, which is the core purpose of indemnification in contracts.",5
indemnification of third party claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The **indemnification clause (Section 10)** is directly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims""** because it establishes the obligations of each party to protect the other from losses arising from claims brought by third parties. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - The clause requires each party to indemnify the other against **""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses""** (including legal fees) arising from third-party claims that are inconsistent with the indemnifying party’s **warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements** in the agreement.  
   - This explicitly covers **third-party claims**, as the indemnity is triggered by external demands or actions (e.g., lawsuits, regulatory actions) that challenge the accuracy or performance of the indemnifying party’s obligations.

2. **Withholding Rights**:  
   - The non-indemnifying party may **withhold payments** owed to the indemnifying party if a third-party claim is pending, in an amount reasonably tied to the claim and associated costs.  
   - This acts as a protective measure to ensure funds are available to cover potential liabilities from third-party claims.

3. **Connection to External Context**:  
   - While the external information provided (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) discusses **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, the indemnification clause complements these by addressing **monetary compensation** for third-party claims.  
   - The external clauses emphasize **specific performance** for breaches, whereas Section 10 focuses on **financial protection** when third parties assert claims due to a party’s misrepresentations or failures under the agreement.

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause directly answers the query by:  
- Defining **how third-party claims are handled** (indemnification process).  
- Allocating **financial responsibility** to the party whose actions/representations triggered the claim.  
- Providing a **mechanism to secure funds** (withholding) pending resolution of such claims.  

It ensures that the non-breaching party is not left bearing costs caused by the other party’s defaults, which aligns with the broader contractual framework (e.g., equitable remedies in the external clauses) to mitigate risks from breaches or external challenges.

The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense at its expense.","The **indemnification clause** you provided is directly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims""** because it outlines the obligations of each party (the **Indemnifying Party**) to compensate the other party (the **Indemnified Party**) for losses arising from third-party claims under specific circumstances.  

### **Key Aspects of the Clause Relevant to Third-Party Claims:**  
1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   - The clause covers **claims, losses, costs, and expenses (including legal fees)** incurred due to third-party claims.  
   - It applies to claims arising from:  
     - The Indemnifying Party’s **acts, omissions, or misrepresentations** (if deemed an agent of the Indemnified Party).  
     - The Indemnifying Party’s **breach of its privacy policy**.  
     - Specific obligations related to **Page Templates, Marks, Banners, Content, or compliance with laws** (depending on which party is responsible).  

2. **Conditions for Indemnification**  
   The Indemnified Party must:  
   - **Notify** the Indemnifying Party of the claim.  
   - **Cooperate** in the defense (at the Indemnifying Party’s expense).  
   - Allow the Indemnifying Party to **control the defense and settlement**, subject to approval if the settlement affects the Indemnified Party’s rights.  

3. **Right to Participate in Defense**  
   - The Indemnified Party retains the right to **join the defense at its own expense**, ensuring oversight.  

### **Connection to External References**  
While the external references (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 10.12**) discuss **equitable remedies (injunctions, specific performance)** for breaches, they reinforce the broader contractual context where indemnification operates. Specifically:  
- The indemnification clause is a **monetary remedy** for third-party claims, whereas the external clauses emphasize **judicial enforcement (equitable relief)** for breaches between the parties.  
- Both frameworks ensure that parties have **adequate legal protections**, whether through **financial compensation (indemnification)** or **court-ordered compliance (specific performance)**.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause is **central to managing third-party liability risks** by:  
- Defining **what claims are covered**.  
- Setting **procedural requirements** for indemnification.  
- Balancing control between the parties in dispute resolution.  

It complements the broader contractual enforcement mechanisms (like injunctions) referenced in the external materials but focuses specifically on **shifting liability for third-party claims** rather than disputes between the contracting parties themselves.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Exclusion of Liability Limitations for Fraud/Gross Negligence**  
- **Sections 11.6 and 11.7** carve out exceptions to the general limitations on liability (e.g., no consequential damages, capped liability) for:  
  - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsections (E) in 11.6 and (V) in 11.7).  
  - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12** (subsections (F) in 11.6 and (VI) in 11.7).  
- This means that if a party commits **fraud or gross negligence**, the other party can seek **full remedies** (including consequential damages and uncapped liability), bypassing the usual contractual limitations.  

### **2. Indemnification for Fraud/Gross Negligence (Article 12)**  
- **Sections 12.1(b) and 12.2(b)** explicitly require each party (BLI and Ginkgo) to **indemnify the other** for Claims/Losses arising from:  
  - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** by their respective indemnitees (e.g., employees, agents).  
- This ensures that the harmed party is fully compensated for losses caused by intentional or egregious misconduct, even if such conduct would otherwise be shielded by liability caps or exclusions.  

### **3. Interaction with Equitable Remedies (External Context)**  
The external references (e.g., *M&A provisions on injunctive relief*) highlight that:  
- Fraud/gross negligence may justify **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) beyond monetary damages.  
- The indemnity clauses here align with this principle by ensuring that liability for such misconduct is **not limited**, preserving the injured party’s right to full legal and equitable redress.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause directly responds to the query by:  
1. **Excluding fraud/gross negligence from liability limitations**, allowing uncapped damages.  
2. **Mandating indemnification** for third-party claims stemming from such misconduct.  
3. Reinforcing that these carve-outs are **non-waivable** (per the ""notwithstanding"" language in 11.6).  

This ensures that parties cannot contractually shield themselves from accountability for **intentional or reckless wrongdoing**.",5

Here’s how they address the query:

### **1. Exclusion of Liability Limitations for Fraud/Gross Negligence (Sections 11.6 and 11.7)**
- **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)**  
  - Generally limits liability for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) but **explicitly carves out exceptions** for:  
    - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection E).  
    - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (subsection F).  
  - This means a party **can still be held liable for consequential damages** if they commit fraud or act with gross negligence.  

- **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)**  
  - Caps a party’s aggregate liability for claims under the agreement but **excludes** the cap for:  
    - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection V).  
    - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (subsection VI).  
  - Thus, liability for fraud or gross negligence is **uncapped**, exposing the breaching party to full damages.  

### **2. Indemnification for Fraud/Gross Negligence (Sections 12.1 and 12.2)**  
- **Section 12.1 (Indemnification by BLI)**  
  - BLI must indemnify Ginkgo for Claims/Losses arising from:  
    - BLI’s **breach of contract**, **material misrepresentation**, or **fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct** (subsection b).  
  - This ensures Ginkgo is protected if BLI’s intentional or reckless misconduct causes harm.  

- **Section 12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo)**  
  - Similarly, Ginkgo must indemnify BLI for Claims/Losses due to:  
    - Ginkgo’s **breach of contract**, **material misrepresentation**, or **fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct** (subsection b).  
  - This reciprocally protects BLI from Ginkgo’s misconduct.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
1. **Fraud and gross negligence are treated as severe breaches**, exempt from liability caps and exclusions that otherwise limit damages.  
2. **Indemnification obligations explicitly cover fraud/gross negligence**, ensuring harmed parties can recover losses caused by such misconduct.  
3. The clauses align with the **external information** (e.g., irreparable harm provisions in MAUD_417 and MAUD_102), reinforcing that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) may also apply alongside indemnification.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clauses ensure that:  
- Parties cannot shield themselves from liability for fraud or gross negligence.  
- Indemnification is mandatory for losses stemming from such misconduct.

Here's the breakdown:

### **1. Exclusion of Liability Limitations for Fraud/Gross Negligence**  
Both **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** carve out exceptions where a party's liability is **not capped** if the claim arises from:  
- **Fraud**  
- **Gross negligence**  
- **Willful misconduct**  

This means:  
- A party **can** be held liable for **consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) if they engage in fraud or gross negligence.  
- The **aggregate liability cap** (Section 11.7) **does not apply** to claims involving fraud or gross negligence.  

### **2. Indemnification Link (Article 12)**  
The clause also references **indemnification obligations under Article 12**, meaning:  
- If fraud/gross negligence triggers indemnification, the indemnifying party **cannot rely on liability caps** to limit exposure.  
- This ensures that victims of fraud/gross negligence can recover **full damages**, including consequential losses.  

### **3. Relevance to External Information**  
The external clauses (on **specific performance** and **equitable relief**) reinforce that:  
- Courts may enforce contractual obligations strictly in cases of fraud/gross negligence.  
- Injunctions or other remedies may be available **without bond posting**, aligning with the idea that fraud/gross negligence warrants stronger remedies.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause ensures that:  
- **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are treated as **serious breaches**, exempt from standard liability protections.  
- Indemnification for such conduct remains **fully enforceable**, overriding any contractual caps on damages.  

Thus, it directly answers the query by confirming that **fraud and gross negligence indemnity claims are not subject to the agreement’s usual liability limitations**.",5

Here’s the breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Exclusion for Fraud, Willful Misconduct, or Gross Negligence**  
   - The clause states that the limitation of liability **does not apply** to damages arising from:  
     - **Fraud**  
     - **Willful misconduct**  
     - **Gross negligence**  
   - This means that if a party commits fraud or gross negligence, they **can still be held fully liable** for indirect, consequential, or other excluded damages that would otherwise be barred under this clause.  

### 2. **Indemnification Implications**  
   - The clause also references indemnification under **Article 11**, clarifying that if a third-party claim involves damages that would typically be excluded (e.g., indirect or consequential losses), but those damages stem from **fraud, gross negligence, or a breach of confidentiality/non-disclosure obligations (Article 9 or Section 5.8)**, the indemnifying party **must still cover them**.  
   - This aligns with the query by reinforcing that **fraud and gross negligence are treated as severe breaches**, warranting full financial responsibility despite general liability limitations.  

### 3. **Comparison with External References**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 10.12**) emphasize **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance)** for breaches but do not address liability carve-outs for fraud/gross negligence.  
   - In contrast, **Clause 11.5** directly answers the query by specifying that **fraud and gross negligence nullify liability protections**, ensuring受害方 can seek full compensation.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is critical for the query because it:  
- **Explicitly preserves liability** for fraud and gross negligence, overriding the general exclusion of indirect/consequential damages.  
- **Ties indemnification obligations** to third-party claims involving such misconduct.  
- **Distinguishes between ordinary breaches** (where liability is limited) and **egregious acts** (where full liability applies).  

Thus, it ensures that a party guilty of fraud or gross negligence cannot shield itself using the agreement’s standard liability limitations.",5
fraud and/or gross negligence indemnity,b1598370cd,"9.5 Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT (I) IN THE EVENT OF THE FRAUD OF A PARTY OR OF A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 7 (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) OR ARTICLE 10 (CONFIDENTIALITY), OR (II) TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO A THIRD PARTY AS PART OF A CLAIM FOR WHICH A PARTY PROVIDES INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE 9, NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR SUBLICENSEES SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, REMOTE, EXEMPLARY OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES OR OTHER DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT PROBABLE AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THAT PARTY OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, OR OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED THE POSSIBILITY OF, ANY SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE; PROVIDED, FOR CLARITY, [***]. ARTICLE 10","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 9.5)** is highly relevant to the query on **fraud and/or gross negligence indemnity** for the following reasons:

### **1. Fraud Exception to Liability Limitation**  
The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability **does not apply** in cases of:  
- **Fraud by a party** (e.g., intentional misrepresentation or deceit).  
- Breach of obligations under **Article 7 (Intellectual Property)** or **Article 10 (Confidentiality)**.  

This means that if a party commits fraud, they **cannot rely on this clause to avoid liability**—even for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages that would otherwise be excluded.  

### **2. Gross Negligence (Implied Exclusion)**  
While the clause does not explicitly mention ""gross negligence,"" its language suggests that **ordinary negligence** is covered by the liability cap (since it excludes liability for negligence generally). However:  
- If gross negligence were alleged, courts might interpret whether it falls under the fraud exception or another carve-out (e.g., indemnifiable third-party claims).  
- The clause’s silence on gross negligence could create ambiguity, potentially leaving it subject to judicial interpretation or external law (e.g., Delaware law, which may not permit limitation of liability for gross negligence).  

### **3. Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause also clarifies that **damages paid to third parties** (e.g., under an indemnity claim) are **not limited** by this provision. Thus:  
- If fraud or gross negligence leads to a third-party claim, the indemnifying party remains fully liable.  
- This aligns with typical indemnity structures where intentional misconduct or gross negligence voids liability caps.  

### **4. Relevance to External Context**  
The external references (e.g., **irreparable harm, injunctive relief**) reinforce that:  
- Fraud/gross negligence breaches may justify **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) beyond monetary damages.  
- The parties acknowledge that certain breaches (like fraud) are so severe that standard remedies (e.g., capped damages) are inadequate.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause **explicitly preserves liability for fraud** and certain breaches (IP/confidentiality) while **limiting liability for ordinary negligence**. However, gross negligence is not directly addressed, creating potential interpretive risk. For indemnity purposes:  
- **Fraud** = No liability limitation.  
- **Gross negligence** = May or may not be limited, depending on jurisdiction and contract interpretation.  
- **Third-party claims** = Indemnity obligations override the limitation.

Section 10.3 NCM Infringement Indemnification.
(a) Indemnifications Obligations. NCM shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Network Affiliate and its Representatives from and against any and all Costs suffered or incurred arising from any and all third party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings to the extent actually or allegedly arising out of, based upon, or relating to any infringement by the NCM Property (but excluding any Equipment) of any third party U.S. trademark, copyright, or patent issued as of the Effective Date, arising from Network Affiliate's use of the NCM Property in accordance and compliance with this Agreement.
(b) Additional Remedies. In addition to, but not in limitation of, NCM's obligations under Section 10.3 (a) above, NCM may, at its sole option, in the event that any claim, suit, proceeding, or action is brought or threatened for which NCM may be obligated under Section 10.3 (a) to indemnify Network Affiliate: (i) replace or modify the NCM Property to render it non-infringing; (ii) secure for Network Affiliate the right to use the NCM Property; or (iii) terminate this Agreement under the provisions of Article X. In the event NCM chooses to terminate this Agreement under Article X hereof, NCM shall refund to Network Affiliate the portion (if any) of the total amount of license fees actually paid to NCM by Network Affiliate hereunder during the two-year period immediately preceding the date of the claim for indemnification, depreciated according to a five-year straight line depreciation.

Here’s how these sections relate to the query:

### **1. Third-Party IP Infringement Indemnity (Key Provisions)**  
- **Section 10.1(ii)**:  
  - **Network Affiliate** indemnifies NCM against third-party claims for **IP infringement** (U.S. patents, trademarks, or copyrights) arising from materials (e.g., content, Brand) supplied by Network Affiliate, provided NCM uses them in compliance with the agreement.  
  - **Scope**: Covers infringement claims if a court finally awards damages or Network Affiliate approves a settlement.  

- **Section 10.3(a)**:  
  - **NCM** indemnifies Network Affiliate against third-party claims for **infringement of U.S. trademarks, copyrights, or patents** (issued as of the Effective Date) arising from Network Affiliate’s **authorized use of NCM Property** (excluding Equipment).  
  - **Exclusions**: NCM is **not liable** if infringement results from:  
    - Network Affiliate’s modifications, combined use with non-NCM products, or failure to use updated NCM Property.  

- **Section 10.3(b)**:  
  - **Remedies for Infringement**: NCM may (at its option) modify/replace infringing property, secure a license, or terminate the agreement (with a refund of fees if terminated).  

- **Section 10.3(c)**:  
  - **Limitations**: NCM’s liability is capped to the remedies in this section, which are the **exclusive** recourse for IP infringement claims.  

### **2. Defense & Settlement (Section 10.4)**  
- The **Indemnitor** (party providing indemnity) controls the defense of third-party claims but must notify the **Indemnitee** (protected party) promptly.  
- **No settlement** is allowed without the other party’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
The clause comprehensively addresses **third-party IP infringement indemnity** by:  
1. Defining **who indemnifies whom** (Network Affiliate for its content; NCM for its property).  
2. Specifying **covered IP types** (U.S. patents, trademarks, copyrights).  
3. Outlining **remedies** (defense, modifications, termination).  
4. **Limiting liability** (exclusions, exclusive remedies).  
5. Detailing **procedural rules** (notice, defense control, settlement approvals).  

### **Connection to External Information**  
While the external excerpts focus on **enforcement/jurisdiction** (e.g., injunctions in Delaware courts), they reinforce that:  
- **Specific performance** (e.g., enforcing indemnity obligations) is a key remedy.  
- **Irreparable harm** justifies equitable relief (aligning with Section 10.3’s remedies like injunctions).  

However, the core **indemnity mechanics** are self-contained in Article X, making it the primary authority for third-party IP infringement risks.  

**Conclusion**: The clause is **highly relevant** to the query, providing a detailed framework for indemnification related to third-party IP claims, including scope, exclusions, remedies, and procedural safeguards.",5
third party IP infringement indemnity,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about **""third party IP infringement indemnity""** because it carves out an exception to a general limitation of liability. Here's the breakdown:

### **Key Elements of the Clause:**
1. **General Limitation of Liability**:  
   The clause states that neither party will be liable for **""special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages""** in most cases. This is a common contractual provision to limit exposure to unpredictable or excessive damages.

2. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement**:  
   The clause **explicitly excludes** claims or liabilities arising from **""infringement of any third-party intellectual property right""** from this limitation. This means:  
   - If a third party sues for IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations), the liable party **can still be held responsible** for the full range of damages, including indirect or consequential losses.  
   - This exception ensures that IP-related risks are treated differently (and more strictly) than other contractual breaches.

### **Relevance to the Query:**
- The clause implies that **indemnification for third-party IP infringement** is treated as a **higher-stakes obligation**—unlike other breaches, the parties cannot shield themselves from broader damages in IP disputes.  
- This aligns with the **external information** (Sections 9.10 and 8.5), which emphasizes **specific performance and equitable relief** for breaches. Since IP infringement can cause irreparable harm (e.g., injunctions, lost market share), courts often allow full remedies rather than limiting liability.  
- The clause effectively **preserves the right to seek full damages** (including consequential losses) in IP cases, reinforcing that IP indemnity is a critical protection in contracts.

### **Practical Implications:**
- A party accused of third-party IP infringement **cannot rely on this clause** to avoid liability for consequential damages (e.g., lost profits due to an injunction).  
- The clause incentivizes parties to **secure strong IP warranties and indemnities** elsewhere in the agreement, as IP risks remain fully exposed.

10.6 The foregoing Clauses 10.1 to 10.5 states the parties' entire liability and exclusive remedy with respect to infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property Rights.","The **""Indemnification by Google""** clause (Clause 10) is directly relevant to the query about **third-party IP infringement indemnity** because it outlines the obligations and limitations of Google and the Distributor regarding claims of intellectual property (IP) infringement by third parties. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Google’s Indemnity Obligation (Clause 10.1)**  
   - Google agrees to indemnify the Distributor against liabilities arising from third-party claims alleging that Google’s **Products or Trademarks** infringe the third party’s copyright, trade secret, or trademark (""IP Claim"").  
   - Conditions for indemnification include prompt notification, cooperation, and granting Google control over the defense/settlement.  

2. **Exclusions to Google’s Liability (Clause 10.2)**  
   Google is **not liable** for IP Claims arising from:  
   - Modified or combined use of Products/Trademarks (not furnished by Google).  
   - Non-compliant use of Products/Trademarks (violating the Agreement).  
   - Content/data provided by Distributor or third parties.  

3. **Google’s Remedial Rights (Clause 10.3)**  
   - Google may **suspend or modify** infringing Products/Trademarks.  
   - Distributor may terminate the Agreement if suspension exceeds 30 days.  

4. **Distributor’s Indemnity Obligation (Clause 10.4)**  
   - The Distributor must indemnify Google for claims arising from:  
     - Improper distribution/marketing of Products (e.g., breach of Clause 8.5).  
     - Infringement claims related to the **Distributor’s App(s)**.  
     - End-user actions (implied in the truncated text).  

5. **Conditions for Distributor’s Indemnity (Clause 10.5)**  
   - Mirroring Google’s requirements, Google must notify, cooperate, and cede control to the Distributor for claims under 10.4(b).  

6. **Exclusive Remedy (Clause 10.6)**  
   - This clause is the **entire liability** for third-party IP infringement, limiting remedies to indemnification (excluding other legal remedies unless specified elsewhere).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause **allocates risk** for third-party IP infringement:  
  - Google covers claims tied to its proprietary assets (Products/Trademarks).  
  - The Distributor covers claims tied to its actions or apps.  
- It defines **procedural requirements** (notice, cooperation, control) to trigger indemnity.  
- It **excludes liability** for misuse or modifications, ensuring indemnity applies only to compliant use.  
- The **exclusive remedy** provision clarifies that indemnification is the sole recourse for IP claims, aligning with the external information’s emphasis on equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) for breaches.  

### Connection to External Information:  
The external clauses highlight **irreparable harm** and **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches. While Clause 10 focuses on monetary indemnity, its carve-outs (e.g., suspension/modification rights in 10.3) imply that equitable remedies may still apply for non-monetary breaches (e.g., continued use of infringing materials). The **exclusive remedy** language (10.6) may interact with broader enforcement terms (like those in the external snippets) to ensure indemnity doesn’t preclude injunctive relief for ongoing violations.  

In summary, this clause **directly addresses third-party IP infringement indemnity** by delineating responsibilities, conditions, and limitations, while implicitly dovetailing with broader contractual enforcement mechanisms.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Third-Party IP Infringement Indemnity by the Company (Section 4.01)**  
   - The **Company agrees to indemnify and defend the Distributor and its customers** against claims arising from third-party allegations of patent, copyright, or proprietary right infringement related to the Products supplied by the Company.  
   - This covers scenarios where a third party asserts that the Product (or its use) infringes their IP rights. The Company assumes responsibility for legal costs, damages, and remedies (e.g., procuring a license or replacing the infringing Product).  
   - **Key Conditions**:  
     - Prompt written notice from the Distributor.  
     - Authority and cooperation granted to the Company for defense.  

### 2. **Distributor’s Indemnity for Trademark Infringement (Section 4.02)**  
   - The **Distributor must indemnify the Company** for claims arising from its **unauthorized use** of the Company’s trademark (Snotarator™) or negligence in marketing/distributing Products.  
   - This addresses third-party claims where the Distributor’s actions (e.g., improper branding) lead to IP violations.  

### 3. **General Indemnity for Third-Party Acts (Section 9.03(c))**  
   - The Distributor indemnifies the Company for claims stemming from **acts of third parties** related to Products sold under the agreement (e.g., liens or security interests). While not exclusively IP-focused, this could overlap with IP disputes (e.g., third-party claims over Product ownership).  

### **Relevance to Query**  
The clause directly addresses:  
- **Third-party IP risks**: Allocating liability between the parties for infringement claims by external entities (e.g., competitors, patent holders).  
- **Procedural safeguards**: Notice requirements, defense control, and remedial actions (e.g., Product replacement).  
- **Scope of indemnity**: Covers patents, copyrights, trademarks, and proprietary rights, aligning with typical IP infringement concerns.  

### **Comparison to External Context**  
While the external excerpts focus on restrictions during mergers (e.g., no-solicitation clauses), the provided clause is more operational, detailing **IP-specific indemnities** in a distributor relationship. It complements broader agreements by specifying how IP disputes are handled, ensuring clarity on liability and defense obligations.  

**Key Takeaway**: This clause is a targeted IP indemnity mechanism, protecting both parties from third-party infringement claims while defining responsibilities for defense and resolution.",5
indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,a1f2e7f3dd,"12. Indemnification. VS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PPD, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any claim, action or proceeding by a third party (a ""Third Party Claim"") arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The **indemnification clause** you provided is directly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement""** in the following ways:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause explicitly covers **Third Party Claims** (claims by non-parties to the agreement) arising from:  
- **Breach of the Agreement** (by either VS or PPD)  
- Negligence or intentional misconduct  

This means if a third party sues PPD because **VS breached the agreement** (or vice versa), the breaching party (indemnifying party) must **defend and cover the costs** (damages, legal fees, etc.) incurred by the other party (indemnified party).

### **2. Notice & Defense Control**  
- The indemnified party must **promptly notify** the indemnifying party of the claim.  
- The indemnifying party **controls the defense and settlement**, ensuring they handle the claim efficiently.  
- However, they must act **reasonably and in good faith** when settling.  

### **3. Right to Participate in Defense**  
- The indemnified party can **join the defense** (but not control it) at its own expense.  
- **Exceptions where the indemnified party takes control**:  
  - If the indemnifying party **fails to defend** the claim.  
  - If the indemnifying party **authorizes separate counsel**.  

### **4. Connection to External Information (Specific Performance Clause)**  
While the external references discuss **specific performance and injunctive relief** (remedies for breach), the indemnification clause complements these by:  
- Addressing **monetary consequences** (legal costs, damages) from third-party claims due to breach.  
- Ensuring the breaching party **bears the financial burden** of third-party actions, not the innocent party.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause is **highly relevant** to the query because it:  
✔ Explicitly covers **third-party claims due to breach of contract**.  
✔ Defines **who pays for legal costs and damages**.  
✔ Establishes **procedures for defense and settlement**.  
✔ Works alongside other remedies (like specific performance) to protect the non-breaching party.

indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,6a700c0c62,"EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query regarding **""indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement""** because it explicitly carves out an exception for such claims from a broader limitation of liability. Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Exception for Third-Party Indemnification**:  
   The clause states that the general exclusion of liability for **consequential, indirect, incidental, etc., damages** (e.g., lost profits, punitive damages) **does not apply** to indemnification obligations under **Section 9** for **third-party claims**. This means:  
   - If a third party sues one party due to the other party’s breach of the agreement, the breaching party can still be held liable for the full scope of damages (including consequential or other excluded damages) **as required by Section 9’s indemnification terms**.  
   - The carve-out ensures that the injured party can recover all losses (even indirect ones) when defending against or settling third-party claims.

2. **Limitation for Direct Claims Between Parties**:  
   For claims **between the contracting parties** (not involving third parties), the clause bars recovery of consequential/indirect damages, regardless of foreseeability or legal theory (contract, tort, etc.). This reinforces that the exception is **solely for third-party claims**.

3. **Alignment with External Context**:  
   The external references (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10) emphasize that breaches may warrant **equitable relief (e.g., injunctions)** because monetary damages may be inadequate. However, the clause you provided focuses on **monetary liability**, clarifying that:  
   - For third-party claims, indemnification obligations (under Section 9) override the limitation on damages.  
   - For direct breaches between parties, only direct damages are recoverable unless equitable relief applies.

### Practical Implications:
- **Third-Party Claims**: The clause ensures that indemnification for third-party claims (e.g., lawsuits from customers, regulators, or other outsiders) remains **unlimited**, protecting the indemnified party from bearing losses caused by the other party’s breach.  
- **Direct Claims**: Parties cannot sue each other for lost profits or punitive damages unless a third party is involved.  

In summary, the clause directly addresses the query by **preserving full indemnification rights for third-party claims** while limiting liability for direct disputes between the parties. This balances risk allocation and incentivizes compliance with the agreement’s terms.",5
indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,a4b3659d9b,"EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIMS SUBJECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS OF SECTION 9.1 (Payment) OR A BREACH OF EITHER PARTY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 5 (CONFIDENTIALITY), NEITHER PARTY WILL, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY OTHER SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","The clause you provided is a **limitation of liability provision**, which is relevant to the query on **indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement** in the following ways:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause explicitly carves out an exception for:  
> *""AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIMS SUBJECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS OF SECTION 9.1 (Payment) OR A BREACH OF EITHER PARTY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 5 (CONFIDENTIALITY).""*  

This means that **indemnification for third-party claims** (e.g., damages, legal costs, or settlements owed to a third party due to a breach of the agreement) **is still enforceable**, even though the clause otherwise limits liability for indirect or consequential damages (e.g., lost profits).  

### **2. Exclusion of Certain Damages**  
The clause states that, **except for the carve-outs mentioned above**, neither party will be liable for:  
- **Lost profits**  
- **Special, indirect, or consequential damages**  

This reinforces that **indemnification for third-party claims (under Section 9.1 or Section 5) remains intact**, while other types of damages (like business losses) are excluded.  

### **3. Connection to External References (Specific Performance & Equitable Relief)**  
The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 9.10*) discuss **specific performance and injunctive relief** for breaches, but they do not override the indemnification carve-out in your clause. Instead, they complement it by ensuring that:  
- A party can still seek **legal or equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches.  
- The limitation of liability does **not prevent indemnification for third-party claims** arising from a breach.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is relevant because it:  
- **Preserves indemnification rights for third-party claims** (under Section 9.1 or Section 5).  
- **Limits liability for other damages** (e.g., lost profits) unless they stem from indemnifiable third-party claims.  
- **Aligns with the broader contractual framework** (e.g., specific performance clauses) by ensuring that remedies for breaches remain available.  

Thus, if a third party sues due to a breach of the agreement, the indemnification provisions (Section 9.1 or Section 5) still apply, even though other damages may be excluded.",5

### 1. **Definition of ""Claim""**  
The clause defines a **""Claim""** broadly to include any third-party claim, action, or proceeding (excluding claims by affiliates). This directly addresses the query by clarifying what constitutes a third-party claim subject to indemnification.

### 2. **Indemnification Obligations (Section 7.2)**  
The clause explicitly outlines the indemnification framework:  
- The **Indemnifying Party** must **defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the Indemnified Party against third-party claims arising from:  
  - **Breach of representations/warranties** (Section 7.1) or **regulatory compliance failures** (Section 4.4).  
  - **Infringement of intellectual property rights** by materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  
  - Other specified liabilities (e.g., site operations, product sales).  
- This aligns with the query by detailing indemnification for third-party claims tied to breaches of the agreement.  

### 3. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**  
- The clause carves out an exception for **third-party claims covered under indemnification** (Section 7.2), ensuring that damages awarded to a third party (e.g., via judgment) are still recoverable despite the general exclusion of consequential damages.  
- This reinforces that indemnification survives even where other liability limitations apply.  

### 4. **Link to External Context**  
The external references (e.g., irreparable harm, equitable relief) highlight that breaches may warrant injunctive relief, but the indemnification clause here focuses on **monetary remedies** for third-party claims. Together, they show a layered approach:  
- **Equitable relief** for preventing breaches.  
- **Indemnification** for compensating third-party claims resulting from breaches.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause directly answers the query by:  
1. Defining third-party claims triggering indemnification.  
2. Specifying that breaches of representations, warranties, or compliance obligations are indemnifiable.  
3. Ensuring indemnification overrides limitations on liability for third-party judgments.  

This creates a clear path for recovering losses from third-party claims arising from contractual breaches.",5
indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The query concerns **indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement**, and the provided **Clause 13.4 (Limitation of Liability)** is relevant in the following ways:

### 1. **Indemnification vs. Liability Limitation**  
   - The clause explicitly states that it does **not limit a Party's indemnification obligations** under the agreement. This means that if a third-party claim arises due to a breach (e.g., a breach of confidentiality under Section 11), the breaching party remains liable to indemnify the other party for such claims, despite the general limitation on liability for other types of damages.  
   - However, the clause **limits liability for certain categories of damages** (e.g., consequential, indirect, punitive) unless such damages are awarded to a third party in a third-party claim. This creates an exception where indemnification would still apply for third-party claims.

### 2. **Third-Party Claims Exception**  
   - The clause carves out an exception for damages **awarded to a third party under a third-party claim**. This means:  
     - If a breach of the agreement leads to a third-party lawsuit (e.g., a customer suing for lost profits due to the breach), the breaching party **cannot rely on the liability limitation** to avoid indemnifying the other party for those third-party damages.  
     - This aligns with the query by ensuring that indemnification obligations for third-party claims survive even where other liability is limited.

### 3. **Interaction with External Clauses (Specific Performance)**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 11.13** and **Section 8.5(c)**) emphasize that breaches may entitle parties to **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance)** because monetary damages may be inadequate.  
   - However, Clause 13.4 focuses on **limiting monetary liability** (not equitable remedies) unless third-party claims are involved. Thus, while specific performance may be available for breaches, indemnification for third-party claims remains enforceable despite the liability cap.

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause ensures that:  
1. Indemnification for **third-party claims** (e.g., damages awarded to a third party due to a breach) is **not limited**, even if other types of damages (e.g., indirect or punitive) are generally excluded.  
2. It preserves the right to seek indemnification for breaches that result in third-party liabilities, which directly addresses the query.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Trademark Infringement Indemnity (Section 4.02)**  
- **Scope**: The Distributor is prohibited from using the Company’s registered trademark **Snotarator™** in a way that infringes the Company’s rights.  
- **Indemnity Obligation**: The Distributor must indemnify the Company for any claims, costs, or liabilities (including attorney fees) arising from its **negligent or faulty use** of the trademark or marketing/distribution of Products.  
- **Relevance to Query**: This directly answers the query by providing a **trademark-specific indemnity clause**, ensuring the Company is protected against third-party claims due to the Distributor’s misuse.  

### **2. Patent & Copyright Infringement Indemnity (Section 4.01)**  
- **Scope**: The Company agrees to indemnify the Distributor and its customers against claims that Products infringe **patents, copyrights, or proprietary rights**.  
- **Conditions**: The Company’s obligation is triggered if:  
  - The Distributor provides **prompt written notice** of the claim.  
  - The Company has **control over the defense** and receives necessary assistance.  
- **Remedies**: If infringement is proven, the Company must either:  
  - Procure rights for continued use of the Product.  
  - Replace the infringing Product with a non-infringing alternative.  
- **Relevance to Query**: This covers **copyright infringement indemnity** (alongside patents), fulfilling the query’s requirement for IP protection.  

### **3. General Indemnity (Section 9.03)**  
While not IP-specific, this clause broadly covers claims arising from the Distributor’s acts or third-party actions (e.g., liens on Products). It complements the IP-specific indemnities by addressing **indirect risks** related to distribution.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause comprehensively addresses the query by:  
- **Explicitly indemnifying trademark infringement** (Section 4.02).  
- **Including copyright in the broader IP indemnity** (Section 4.01).  
- **Providing procedural safeguards** (notice, defense control, remedies).  

This ensures both parties are protected against IP-related liabilities, with clear accountability for infringement claims.  

**Key Takeaway**: If the query seeks a clause where one party indemnifies the other for trademark or copyright infringement, this example **fully satisfies** that requirement with enforceable terms.",5

- **Cooperation** in defense (providing information and assistance).  
- **Google’s control** over the defense and settlement.  
- **Exclusions** (Clause 10.2) where Google is not liable (e.g., misuse of Products/Trademarks or third-party content).  

### **3. Reciprocal Indemnity for Distributor’s IP Infringement**  
- **Clause 10.4(b)** requires the Distributor to indemnify Google for third-party claims that the **Distributor’s App(s)** infringe a third party’s **copyright, trademark, or trade secret**.  
- This ensures mutual protection against IP infringement risks.  

### **4. Remedies & Limitations**  
- **Clause 10.6** clarifies that this indemnity is the **exclusive remedy** for third-party IP infringement claims.  
- Google also has the right to **suspend or modify infringing Products/Trademarks** (Clause 10.3) to mitigate liability.  

### **Relevance to External References**  
While the external clauses (from MAUD) discuss **injunctive relief and equitable remedies** for breaches, the provided indemnity clause focuses on **monetary compensation** for IP infringement. However, both reinforce the importance of **legal enforcement mechanisms** in contracts.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **directly answers the query** by:  
- Clearly defining indemnification for **trademark and copyright infringement claims**.  
- Outlining **conditions, exclusions, and procedures** for enforcement.  
- Providing **reciprocal indemnity obligations** between Google and the Distributor.

10.6 The foregoing Clauses 10.1 to 10.5 states the parties' entire liability and exclusive remedy with respect to infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property Rights.","The clause you provided (Clause 10: **Indemnification by Google**) is directly relevant to the query about **IP infringement indemnity covering trademark or copyright** for the following reasons:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification for IP Infringement (Trademark & Copyright)**  
- **Section 10.1** states that Google will indemnify the Distributor against third-party claims alleging that:  
  - **Products** or **Google Trademarks** infringe a third party’s:  
    - **Copyright**  
    - **Trademark**  
    - **Trade secret**  
- This explicitly covers **trademark and copyright infringement claims**, which aligns with the query.  

### **2. Conditions for Indemnification**

- **Modified use** of Products/Trademarks (**10.2(a)**)  
- **Unauthorized use** (violating the Agreement) (**10.2(b)**)  
- **Third-party content** provided by Distributor/End Users (**10.2(c)**)  

### **4. Reciprocal Indemnity (Distributor’s Obligations)**

IP infringement indemnity that covers trademark or copyright,b7896bb998,"To the extent that such IPRs do not vest automatically in the Company by operation of law, you hereby assign and agree to assign to the Company all of your right, title and interest in any existing and future IPRs which may subsist in any Works for their full term of protection (including any extensions, revivals and renewals) together with the right to sue and claim remedies for past infringement and all materials embodying these rights to the fullest extent permitted by law in any and all countries of the world.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query about **IP infringement indemnity covering trademark or copyright** in the following ways:

### **1. Assignment of IP Rights (Trademarks & Copyrights)**  
The clause ensures that all **Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs)**—which include **trademarks and copyrights**—are assigned to the Company if they do not automatically vest by law. This means:  
- Any **trademarks** (brand names, logos) or **copyrights** (creative works, software) created by the counterparty (""you"") must be transferred to the Company.  
- The Company gains full ownership, including the right to enforce these rights against third-party infringements.  

### **2. Right to Sue for Past & Future Infringement**  
The clause explicitly grants the Company the right to:  
- **Sue for past infringement** (e.g., if someone used the assigned trademarks or copyrighted works without permission before the assignment).  
- **Claim remedies** (damages, injunctions, etc.) for such infringements.  

This is crucial for **indemnity purposes** because:  
- If a third party sues the Company for IP infringement (e.g., claiming that a trademark or copyright was misused), the Company can rely on this clause to show it legally owns the IP and has the right to enforce it.  
- The Company can also pursue legal action against infringers, reducing its liability exposure.  

### **3. Connection to Indemnity Provisions**  
While this clause does not explicitly mention **indemnification**, it supports an IP infringement indemnity framework by:  
- **Ensuring clear ownership** (so the Company can defend against third-party claims).  
- **Providing legal standing** to enforce IP rights, which is necessary if the Company needs to seek indemnification from the counterparty for IP-related breaches.  

### **Relevance to External References**  
The external clauses (from MAUD) discuss **irreparable harm** and **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches. Your clause aligns with this by:  
- Ensuring the Company can seek **specific performance** (forcing assignment of IP) if the counterparty refuses to transfer rights.  
- Supporting **injunctive relief** if IP rights are misused or threatened to be misused.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause strengthens the Company’s position in an **IP infringement indemnity** scenario by:  
✔ Transferring ownership of trademarks/copyrights.  
✔ Allowing enforcement against past/future infringements.  
✔ Supporting legal remedies (aligned with the external clauses on injunctions and specific performance).  

For a complete **indemnity clause**, you would typically pair this with an explicit obligation for the counterparty to **indemnify the Company** against third-party IP claims (e.g., warranties of non-infringement and defense obligations). Would you like help drafting such a provision?",5
IP infringement indemnity that covers trademark or copyright,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided is a **limitation of liability provision** that excludes certain types of damages (e.g., indirect, consequential, punitive) **unless** the claim arises from a third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement. Here’s how it relates to your query about **IP infringement indemnity covering trademark or copyright**:

### Relevance to IP Infringement Indemnity:
1. **Carve-Out for IP Claims**:  
   - The clause explicitly **excludes IP infringement claims** (e.g., trademark or copyright violations by a third party) from the general limitation on liability.  
   - This means that if a third party sues for IP infringement (e.g., alleging unauthorized use of their trademark or copyrighted material), the liable party **could still be responsible for special, indirect, or consequential damages** arising from that infringement.  

2. **Indemnity Implications**:  
   - While this clause doesn’t create an affirmative indemnity obligation, it **preserves the possibility of broader liability for IP-related claims**.  
   - In practice, this aligns with typical indemnity clauses where IP infringement (including trademark/copyright) is treated as a high-risk area, often requiring the indemnifying party to cover **all damages** (not just direct ones).  

3. **Connection to External Context**:  
   - The external references (e.g., Sections 9.10 and 8.5) emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches, including IP-related breaches.  
   - This suggests that IP infringement is treated as a material breach where monetary damages alone may not suffice (consistent with the carve-out in your clause).  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause ensures that **IP infringement claims are not shielded** by the general limitation of liability, leaving room for indemnity or other remedies to cover full damages (including consequential losses). If you’re drafting an IP indemnity clause, you’d want to explicitly address:  
- **Scope**: Clearly cover trademark/copyright infringement.  
- **Damages**: Specify whether indirect/consequential damages are included.  
- **Indemnity Triggers**: Link to third-party claims (as implied by your clause).

A claim that a Party (referred to at times in this Section as an ""Indemnifying Party"") is required to defend and indemnify the other Party (referred to at times in this Section as an ""Indemnified Party"") under this Agreement is referred to at times in this Section as an ""Indemnified Claim"". Defense and indemnification under this Section will include, without limitation, (1) paying or reimbursing the actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement of any civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, arbitration, mediation, hearing, audit, investigation or other proceeding threatened or commenced against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim (e.g., fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants, auditors, investigators, consulting experts, testifying experts and other consultants; fees and expenses of an arbitrator or mediator; filing fees and costs imposed by any court, administrative agency or other tribunal; etc.), and (2) satisfying any judgment, award, order, lien, levy, fine, penalty or other sanction imposed against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim. b. Seller will defend and indemnify Buyer against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Seller, including, without limitation, any product supplied by Seller which fails to conform to the representations and warranties in this Agreement; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Seller in the design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery of any product sold by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Seller under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, packaging, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement (except to the extent that the infringement is based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license terms in supplying the product); (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by a governmental authority on Buyer to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Seller of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Seller has agreed to defend and indemnify Buyer against under a Purchase Schedule. c. Buyer will defend and indemnify Seller against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Buyer; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Buyer in the purchase, storage, repackaging, resale or delivery of any product purchased from Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Buyer under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement to the extent based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license term in supplying the product; (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by governmental authority on Seller to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Buyer of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Buyer has agreed to defend and indemnify Seller against under a Purchase Schedule. d. As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The **indemnification clause** in the agreement is relevant to the query about whether indemnification covers **indirect claims** in the following ways:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification (Direct vs. Indirect Claims)**
The clause broadly defines **""Indemnified Claims""** to include:
- **Third-party claims** (e.g., personal injury, property damage, infringement claims, fines/penalties by government authorities).  
- **Expenses** (e.g., legal fees, investigation costs, settlements, judgments).  

While the clause does not explicitly use the term **""indirect claims,""** it covers **consequential liabilities** arising from breaches, negligence, or misconduct, which may include indirect damages suffered by the indemnified party due to third-party actions.  

### **2. Key Provisions Supporting Coverage of Indirect Claims**
- **Subsection (a)(2)** requires indemnification for **""any judgment, award, order, lien, levy, fine, penalty, or other sanction""**—which could encompass indirect financial consequences (e.g., regulatory penalties or reputational harm).  
- **Subsection (b)(4) & (c)(4)** explicitly cover **fines/penalties imposed by governmental authorities**, which are often indirect consequences of a party’s violation of law.  
- **Subsection (b)(1)-(3) & (c)(1)-(3)** include **third-party claims for losses** (e.g., infringement, negligence), which may involve downstream or indirect harm (e.g., lost profits due to defective products).  

### **3. Limitations & Conditions**
- The indemnified party must **promptly notify** and **cooperate** with the indemnifying party (Subsection **d**).  
- The indemnifying party **controls the defense and settlement** (Subsection **e**), which may limit how indirect claims are handled.  
- The clause does **not explicitly exclude indirect claims**, suggesting they are covered if they fall under the defined categories (e.g., third-party claims, fines, or sanctions).  

### **4. Comparison with External References**
The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 10.12**) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) but do not conflict with indemnification for indirect claims. Instead, they reinforce that monetary damages may be inadequate, aligning with the indemnification clause’s focus on **compensating for actual losses** (direct or indirect).  

### **Conclusion**
The indemnification clause **likely covers indirect claims** to the extent they arise from:  
- **Third-party actions** (e.g., lawsuits, regulatory penalties).  
- **Consequential damages** tied to breaches, negligence, or misconduct.  
However, **express language on ""indirect"" or ""consequential"" damages** is absent, so applicability may depend on interpretation and jurisdiction. If broader coverage is desired, the clause could be amended to explicitly include **""indirect, consequential, or incidental damages.""**

Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;
(4) If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, with a reservation of all rights to seek indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party; provided, that Indemnitee may enter into a settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the indemnifying party, if the terms of such settlement (i) include only money damages as a remedy, (ii) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on the indemnifying party's business and (iii) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by the indemnifying party; and
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The **indemnification clause (Section 9.1)** is directly relevant to the query about whether indemnification covers **indirect claims** because it explicitly includes losses arising **""directly or indirectly""** from the indemnifying party's actions or breaches. Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Points Addressing Indirect Claims:
1. **Scope of Indemnification (Section 9.1(a))**  
   - The clause covers **""any and all loss... whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding""**, including claims brought by third parties.  
   - The phrase **""to the extent resulting directly or indirectly""** explicitly extends indemnification to losses caused by **secondary or consequential effects** of the indemnifying party’s:  
     - Breach of the agreement (e.g., failure to perform obligations).  
     - Negligence or willful misconduct.  

   This means claims that are not the immediate/direct result of the indemnifying party’s actions but are still causally linked (e.g., downstream damages or third-party claims triggered by the breach) are covered.

2. **Examples of Indirect Claims Covered**  
   - If Party A’s breach of contract causes Party B to face a lawsuit from a third party (e.g., a customer harmed by Party A’s defective product), Party A must indemnify Party B for the third-party claim, even though the claim is ""indirect"" to the original breach.  
   - Similarly, if Party A’s negligence leads to property damage that disrupts Party B’s operations, resulting in losses from delayed contracts, those consequential losses may be indemnified as ""indirect"" damages.

3. **Procedural Safeguards (Section 9.1(b))**  
   - The claims procedure ensures that even indirect claims are handled systematically:  
     - The **Claims Notice** requirement applies to any ""Asserted Liability"" that **might** result in a loss, including potential indirect claims.  
     - The indemnifying party controls the defense but must consult the indemnitee, ensuring indirect claims are not settled in a way that harms the indemnitee (e.g., non-monetary obligations or admissions of wrongdoing).  

### Connection to External Context:  
While the external excerpts focus on **specific performance** (remedies for breaches), they underscore the parties’ intent to enforce obligations strictly. This aligns with the indemnification clause’s broad coverage of indirect claims, as both provisions aim to mitigate all forms of harm—whether direct or indirect—arising from breaches.

### Conclusion:  
The clause **explicitly covers indirect claims** by:  
- Using the term **""indirectly""** to define the causal scope.  
- Including third-party claims and consequential losses.  
- Providing a framework to address such claims procedurally.  

This ensures comprehensive protection for the indemnitee against cascading liabilities.",5
indemnification covers indirect claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The query asks whether the indemnification clause covers **indirect claims**. Here’s how the provided clause addresses this:

### Key Points from the Indemnification Clause:
1. **Broad Scope of Covered Claims**:  
   The clause requires each party to indemnify the other for **""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses""** arising from breaches of warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements in the Agreement.  
   - The phrase **""arising out of or connected with""** is expansive and could include **indirect claims** (e.g., consequential damages, third-party claims, or downstream losses) as long as they are factually or legally tied to a breach of the Agreement.  

2. **No Explicit Exclusion of Indirect Claims**:  
   The clause does not limit indemnification to **direct claims** (e.g., explicit breaches by the indemnifying party). Absent such limitation, courts may interpret the language to cover indirect claims, especially if they are foreseeable consequences of a breach.  

3. **Withholding Rights for Pending Claims**:  
   The non-indemnifying party may withhold payments related to a claim, including **estimated costs/expenses**. This suggests coverage extends to **consequential financial impacts** (indirect losses) stemming from the claim.  

### Relevance to External Information:  
While the external excerpts focus on **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, they reinforce that the Agreement prioritizes **broad protection** against harm, including irreparable damage. This contextual intent supports interpreting the indemnification clause **expansively**, potentially encompassing indirect claims.  

### Conclusion:  
The indemnification clause is likely broad enough to cover **indirect claims**, as it:  
- Uses open-ended language (""arising out of or connected with"").  
- Covers all losses tied to breaches, not just direct damages.  
- Aligns with the Agreement’s overarching emphasis on comprehensive remedies.  

For absolute clarity, the clause could explicitly mention ""indirect, consequential, or incidental claims,"" but its current wording is sufficiently inclusive.",5

The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The **indemnification clause** provided is relevant to the query (*""indemnification covers indirect claims""*) in the following ways:

### 1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
The clause explicitly covers **""any and all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities""** arising from third-party claims (Third Party Claims). While it does not explicitly use the term ""indirect claims,"" the broad language (""any and all liabilities"") suggests that indemnification may extend to **consequential, incidental, or indirect losses** resulting from the specified conduct (negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of agreement).  

   - **Example:** If a third party sues PPD for losses caused by VS's breach of contract, and PPD incurs legal fees, reputational harm, or lost profits as a result, these could be considered indirect damages covered under indemnification.  

### 2. **Third-Party Claims (Indirect Liability)**  
The clause focuses on claims brought by **third parties**, which inherently involve indirect liability. For instance:  
   - If VS's actions cause harm to a customer who then sues PPD (e.g., due to a partnership or supply chain relationship), PPD’s indemnification right would cover its defense costs and liabilities—even though the original fault lay with VS.  

### 3. **Limitations and Exclusions**  
The clause does **not** expressly exclude indirect claims (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm). However, its applicability depends on:  
   - **Causation**: The claim must arise from the indemnifying party’s negligence, misconduct, or breach.  
   - **Notice & Control**: The indemnified party must notify the indemnifier promptly, and the indemnifier controls the defense (unless they fail to act).  

### 4. **Comparison to External Context**  
The external information provided discusses **specific performance** (equitable relief for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate). While not directly about indemnification, it underscores that contractual remedies can extend beyond direct monetary losses—supporting the interpretation that indemnification may cover indirect consequences of breaches.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause likely covers **indirect claims** (e.g., downstream third-party claims, consequential damages) if they stem from the indemnifying party’s breach or misconduct. However, explicit language clarifying coverage of indirect damages (e.g., ""including consequential or incidental losses"") would strengthen this interpretation.

indemnification covers indirect claims,48a7852086,"7. Indemnification. <omitted> (c) Any and all claims, losses, cost or expenses shall be limited to actual and direct costs. In no event shall any party be responsible to the other for indirect, special or consequential damages.","The clause **7. Indemnification (c)** explicitly limits indemnification claims to **actual and direct costs**, excluding **indirect, special, or consequential damages**. This directly addresses the query about whether indemnification covers indirect claims by stating that it does **not**.  

### Key Points:  
1. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - Only **actual and direct costs** (e.g., quantifiable financial losses) are recoverable.  
   - **Indirect claims** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, business interruption) are explicitly excluded.  

2. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The phrase *""In no event shall any party be responsible... for indirect, special or consequential damages""* reinforces that indemnification is **strictly limited** to direct losses.  

3. **Relevance to Query**:  
   - The clause **denies coverage for indirect claims**, aligning with the query’s concern.  
   - Even if a claim arises indirectly from a breach (e.g., downstream financial impacts), the indemnifying party would not be liable under this provision.  

### Contrast with External Context:  
The external excerpts (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **8.10**) discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches but do not override the indemnification clause’s monetary limitations. They address **enforcement of contractual obligations**, not financial compensation for indirect losses.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **7(c)** is a clear **limitation on indemnification**, excluding indirect claims. Parties cannot seek recovery for consequential or speculative damages under this agreement.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Definition of ""Claim""**  
The clause defines **""Claim""** as any claim, action, or proceeding instituted by a **third party** (excluding affiliates of either party). This means that the indemnification obligations are triggered by third-party claims, not first-party disputes between the contracting parties themselves.  

- **Relevance to Query:** If the query pertains to **first-party claims** (i.e., disputes directly between the two parties to the agreement), this clause does **not** cover them. Instead, it focuses on third-party claims.  

### **2. Indemnification Scope (Section 7.2)**  
The indemnity provision requires the **Indemnifying Party** to defend and indemnify the **Indemnified Party** against third-party claims arising from:  
- The operation/content of the Indemnifying Party’s site  
- Product sales/marketing on the Indemnifying Party’s site  
- Breach of representations/warranties  
- Intellectual Property infringement  

- **Relevance to Query:** If the query is about whether **first-party claims** (e.g., breach of contract between the two parties) are covered, the answer is **no**—this clause only applies to third-party claims.  

### **3. No Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**  
This section clarifies that neither party is liable for **indirect or consequential damages** unless:  
- They arise from a third-party claim covered under **Section 7.2 (Indemnity)**  
- They result from a breach of confidentiality (**Section 11.4**)  

- **Relevance to Query:** If the query is about whether **first-party claims** can lead to liability for consequential damages, the answer is generally **no**, unless the claim involves a breach of confidentiality.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The indemnification clause (**Section 7.2**) **does not apply to first-party claims**—it only covers third-party claims.  
- **First-party disputes** (e.g., breach of contract between the parties) would be governed by other provisions (e.g., remedies under general contract law, specific performance, or injunctive relief, as referenced in the **external information**).  
- **Consequential damages** are excluded for first-party claims unless they involve confidentiality breaches.  

### **Conclusion**  
If the query is about whether **first-party claims** are indemnifiable under this clause, the answer is **no**—the indemnity provision is limited to third-party claims. For first-party disputes, remedies would likely be found elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., specific performance, injunctive relief, or general breach of contract claims).

Indemnification of first party claims,26cf5a392e,"""Claim"" means any claim, action or proceeding instituted by a third party (other than an Affiliate of a Party), including, without limitation, any governmental authority. <omitted>
7.2 Indemnity.

### **Relevance of the Provided Clause to the Query:**  
The clause defines **""Claim""** as any claim, action, or proceeding instituted by a **third party (excluding Affiliates of a Party)**. This means the indemnification obligations under **Section 7.2** apply only to **third-party claims**, not disputes between the contracting parties themselves (first-party claims).  

#### **Key Observations:**  
1. **Scope of Indemnification (Third-Party Claims Only)**  
   - The indemnity provision explicitly covers claims brought by **third parties (e.g., customers, regulators, or unrelated entities)**.  
   - It does **not** apply to disputes between the Parties (e.g., breach of contract claims by one party against the other).  

2. **First-Party Claims Are Excluded**  
   - If one party sues the other for breach of contract, misrepresentation, or other disputes arising under the agreement, this indemnification clause **would not apply**.  
   - Instead, such claims would typically be resolved through:  
     - **Contractual remedies** (e.g., damages, termination rights)  
     - **Equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance, as referenced in the external provisions from MAUD)  

3. **External Context (MAUD Provisions)**  
   - The external clauses (MAUD 102 & 417) reinforce that **first-party disputes** are handled through **legal/equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) rather than indemnification.  
   - They emphasize that monetary damages may be inadequate for breaches, justifying court-ordered enforcement rather than indemnity.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause is **not directly relevant** to first-party claims because it governs **third-party indemnification only**. For disputes between the contracting parties, other provisions (e.g., breach remedies, dispute resolution, or equitable relief clauses) would apply.  

If the query seeks indemnification for **inter-party claims**, the agreement would need an explicit **first-party indemnity clause**—which this is not. Instead, the Parties must rely on general breach-of-contract remedies.

Indemnification of first party claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The **indemnification clause (Section 10)** is directly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of first party claims""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
The clause specifies that each party (the ""indemnifying party"") must indemnify the other party against:  
- **Claims, damages, liabilities, costs, etc.** arising from breaches of **warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements** made in the agreement.  
- This includes **first-party claims** (i.e., claims brought by one party against the other under the agreement) if they stem from a breach of the agreement’s terms.  

### 2. **Withholding Rights Pending Resolution**  
The clause grants the **non-indemnifying party** the right to withhold payments owed to the indemnifying party if a claim is pending, in an amount **reasonably related** to the claim and associated costs (e.g., legal fees). This acts as a protective measure for the non-breaching party while disputes are resolved.  

### 3. **Connection to External Context**  
The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 10.12*) emphasize:  
- **Equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches, reinforcing that monetary damages alone may not suffice.  
- The indemnification clause complements these remedies by addressing **financial compensation** for losses due to breaches, ensuring the harmed party is made whole.  

### Key Relevance to the Query  
The clause **explicitly covers first-party claims** between the contracting parties (not just third-party claims) by tying indemnification to breaches of the agreement itself. It ensures that:  
- A party harmed by the other’s non-performance or misrepresentation can recover costs.  
- The indemnifying party bears the financial burden of its breaches, aligning with the broader enforcement mechanisms (e.g., equitable relief) noted in the external context.  

### Practical Implications  
- **For the first party (claimant):** Provides a contractual right to recover losses caused by the other party’s defaults.  
- **For the indemnifying party:** Creates liability for failing to uphold its contractual promises, with immediate financial consequences (e.g., withheld payments).  

In summary, this clause is a **critical risk-allocation tool** for first-party disputes under the agreement, working alongside equitable remedies to ensure compliance and redress.",5

The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The **Indemnification Clause** provided is directly relevant to the query about **""Indemnification of first party claims""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   - The clause outlines mutual indemnification obligations between **VS** (indemnifying party) and **PPD** (indemnified party), covering:  
     - **Third-party claims** (not first-party claims, which would involve disputes directly between the contracting parties).  
     - Claims arising from **negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement**.  

   - **Relevance to Query**: While the clause focuses on third-party claims, it indirectly affects first-party claims by:  
     - Excluding indemnification for disputes between the parties themselves (e.g., breach of contract claims between VS and PPD).  
     - Highlighting that first-party disputes (e.g., breaches) may be resolved through other remedies (e.g., specific performance or injunctions, as referenced in the external information).  

### 2. **Notice and Control of Claims**  
   - The clause requires the **indemnified party** to notify the indemnifying party promptly of any third-party claim.  
   - The **indemnifying party** controls the defense/settlement, subject to good faith and reasonableness.  
   - The indemnified party may participate but not control unless the indemnifying party fails to act.  

   - **Relevance to Query**: For first-party claims (e.g., breach of contract), this structure implies:  
     - The parties would rely on **non-indemnification remedies** (e.g., litigation, arbitration, or specific performance).  
     - The external information (Section 7.11) supports this by emphasizing **specific performance and injunctions** as remedies for breaches between the parties.  

### 3. **Limitation to Third-Party Claims**  
   - The clause explicitly covers **only third-party claims**, not disputes between VS and PPD.  
   - First-party claims (e.g., one party suing the other for breach) would fall under:  
     - **General dispute resolution mechanisms** (not indemnification).  
     - **Equitable remedies** (like specific performance, per the external text).  

### **Key Takeaway for the Query**  
The clause does **not** address indemnification for first-party claims (direct disputes between the parties). Instead:  
- It governs how third-party claims are handled.  
- First-party claims would be resolved through **breach-of-contract remedies** (e.g., damages, specific performance, or injunctions).  

If the query seeks to extend indemnification to first-party claims, the clause would need modification to include language such as:  
> *""Each party shall indemnify the other for losses arising from first-party claims due to breach of this Agreement.""*  

However, as drafted, the clause is **not applicable to first-party claims**. The external information (Section 7.11) aligns with this interpretation by highlighting **specific performance and injunctions**—not indemnification—as the primary tools for enforcing contractual obligations between the parties.

### 1. **Definition of ""Claim""**  
   - The clause defines **""Claim""** broadly to include claims, actions, or proceedings by **third parties** (excluding affiliates of either party). This clarifies that indemnification applies to **external claims** (not disputes between the contracting parties themselves).  
   - However, the clause does **not** cover first-party claims (e.g., direct disputes between the parties). Instead, it focuses on third-party liabilities (e.g., lawsuits from customers, regulators, or IP infringement claims).

### 2. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   The indemnifying party (the one responsible for defense) must cover:  
   - **Third-party claims** related to:  
     - Operation/content of their website (unless caused by the indemnified party).  
     - Products/services sold through their site (with exceptions noted).  
     - Breaches of their representations/warranties (Section 7.1) or regulatory compliance (Section 4.4).  
     - IP infringement claims arising from materials they provided.  
   - **Costs** include legal fees, damages, and awards from such claims.  

### 3. **Exclusion of First-Party Claims**  
   - The clause explicitly addresses **third-party claims**, meaning it does **not** govern disputes between the two contracting parties (e.g., breach of contract claims by one party against the other).  
   - For first-party disputes, remedies would typically be addressed elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., through **liquidated damages, termination rights, or equitable relief** like injunctions, as referenced in the external information from Sections 8.5 and 10.12).  

### 4. **Link to External Context**  
   - The external clauses (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) emphasize **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches of the agreement, which complements the indemnification clause by addressing **first-party enforcement mechanisms**.  
   - Together, these provisions create a framework:  
     - **Indemnification (Section 7.2)**: Covers third-party liabilities.  
     - **Equitable Relief (Sections 8.5/10.12)**: Covers first-party breaches (e.g., failure to perform obligations).  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause is **not directly applicable to first-party claims** but is highly relevant to understanding the contract’s **risk allocation for third-party claims**. For first-party disputes, the agreement likely relies on other provisions (e.g., specific performance, injunctions) as highlighted in the external context.

indemnification clauses that include hold harmless,317052cc02,"G. INDEMNIFICATION
The respective parties shall indemnify and hold one another harmless as follows:
1. MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any MICOA act or omission, except to the extent the Agency has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.
2. Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.","The clause provided is directly relevant to the query about **indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless""** because it explicitly combines both concepts in a mutual indemnification agreement between two parties (MICOA and the Agency). Here’s the breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Indemnification with ""Hold Harmless"" Language**  
   - The clause uses the phrase **""indemnify and hold harmless""**, which is a standard formulation in contracts to ensure that one party (the indemnifying party) not only compensates the other (the indemnified party) for losses but also protects them from future claims or liabilities arising from specified acts or omissions.  
   - Example:  
     - *""MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any MICOA act or omission…""*  
     - *""Agency shall indemnify and hold MICOA harmless against any act or omission of the Agency…""*  

### 2. **Mutual Indemnification Structure**  
   - The clause is **bilateral**, meaning both parties agree to indemnify each other for their respective faults (acts/omissions), creating reciprocal protection. This is common in agreements where both parties assume risks.  

### 3. **Exceptions to Indemnification**  
   - The clause includes carve-outs where indemnification **does not apply** if the other party caused or contributed to the harm (e.g., *""except to the extent [the other party] has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error""*). This prevents unjust enrichment and ensures fairness.  

### 4. **Connection to External Information**  
   - While the external documents provided (e.g., *Maud_102* on equitable relief) don’t directly address indemnification, they highlight the importance of contractual remedies (like injunctions) for breaches. The indemnification clause here serves a similar purpose by allocating financial responsibility for breaches or harms, complementing broader enforcement mechanisms.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause is a clear example of an indemnification provision that incorporates **""hold harmless""** language to allocate risk between parties, with mutual obligations and exceptions for shared fault. It aligns with standard contractual practices to mitigate liability and ensure accountability.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Elements of the Clause Relevant to the Query:
1. **Indemnification with ""Hold Harmless"" Language**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the Indemnifying Party shall **""indemnify, hold harmless, and defend""** the Indemnified Party.  
   - The inclusion of **""hold harmless""** ensures that the Indemnified Party is protected not only from financial losses (indemnification) but also from being legally or financially burdened by claims or liabilities caused by the Indemnifying Party’s actions.

2. **Scope of Coverage**:  
   - The clause broadly covers **all claims, demands, losses, damages, etc.**, arising from the Indemnifying Party’s acts or omissions, including negligence, breaches of contract, legal violations, and intellectual property infringement.  
   - This aligns with typical indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless,"" as they aim to shift liability comprehensively.

3. **Defense Obligation**:  
   - The term **""defend""** further reinforces the ""hold harmless"" aspect by requiring the Indemnifying Party to actively protect the Indemnified Party from legal actions (e.g., lawsuits).  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts focus on **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, the indemnification clause complements such provisions by addressing **monetary and liability protections**. For example:  
- If a breach occurs (as discussed in the external texts), the indemnification clause ensures that the harmed party is compensated for losses, while equitable remedies (like specific performance) may address the breach itself.  
- The ""hold harmless"" aspect ensures the Indemnified Party is not left bearing costs or legal exposure due to the other party’s actions.  

### Why This Clause Fits the Query:  
The clause is a **textbook example** of an indemnification provision that includes ""hold harmless"" language, as it:  
1. Explicitly uses the phrase **""hold harmless""** alongside ""indemnify.""  
2. Defines the scope of protection broadly, covering both financial and legal risks.  
3. Reflects standard contractual risk allocation, where one party assumes responsibility for certain liabilities.  

Thus, it directly answers the query by illustrating how ""hold harmless"" operates within an indemnification clause.",5
indemnification clauses that include hold harmless,ca78a8476d,"The foregoing indemnities shall expressly exclude any liability for consequential, punitive, special or similar damages, including, without limitation, lost profits.","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless""** provisions. While the provided clause does not explicitly use the term ""hold harmless,"" it is relevant to indemnification because it **limits the scope of liability** under an indemnity agreement. Here’s how:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**:  
   The clause states that the indemnity does not cover:  
   - Consequential damages  
   - Punitive damages  
   - Special damages  
   - Lost profits (a subset of consequential damages)  

   This is a common feature in indemnification clauses to **limit exposure** to unpredictable or excessive liabilities.

2. **Connection to ""Hold Harmless""**:  
   - A ""hold harmless"" agreement typically requires one party to protect another from losses, claims, or damages.  
   - By **excluding certain types of damages**, this clause effectively **defines the boundaries** of what the indemnitor (the party providing indemnity) must ""hold harmless"" the indemnitee (the protected party) against.  
   - It ensures the indemnitor is not responsible for indirect or speculative losses (e.g., lost profits), which aligns with the risk allocation intent of a hold harmless provision.

3. **Relevance to External Context**:  
   The external information discusses **specific performance** and **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, but it does not directly address indemnification. However, the indemnity clause here complements such provisions by clarifying that **monetary remedies for certain damages are excluded**, even if equitable relief is pursued.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- While the clause doesn’t use the phrase ""hold harmless,"" it **operationally functions as part of an indemnification framework** by carving out exceptions to liability.  
- In practice, indemnification clauses often combine:  
  - A **broad hold harmless obligation** (e.g., ""Party A shall indemnify and hold harmless Party B from all claims...""),  
  - **Exclusions or limitations** (like this clause) to narrow the scope.  

### Suggested Refinement:
If the query seeks explicit ""hold harmless"" language, a more complete indemnification clause might look like:  
> *""Party A shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Party B from all losses, except for consequential, punitive, special, or similar damages, including lost profits.""*  

This combines the hold harmless obligation with the exclusion in your clause.

indemnification clauses that include hold harmless,23f7ce3cd2,"8. CONFIDENTIALITY. <omitted>
12.1 Each Party (""Indemnitor"") will defend, indemnify and hold the other Party (including associated officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and affiliates) (cumulatively, ""Indemnitee"") harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees), suffered or incurred as a result of or in connection with any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding brought against Indemnitee based upon (a) a claim of a failure to perform, or a breach by Indemnitor of, any obligation, warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; (b) a claim of personal injury or property damage arising out of the fault or negligence of Indemnitor, its representatives, agents, or employees; or (c) a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right held by any third party.

### **Relevance of the Provided Clause to the Query:**  
The clause (Section 12.1) explicitly includes **""indemnify and hold harmless""**, which directly addresses the query. Here’s how it aligns:  

1. **Indemnification Structure**:  
   - The clause obligates the **Indemnitor** (one party) to:  
     - **Defend**: Cover legal costs for claims against the Indemnitee.  
     - **Indemnify**: Reimburse the Indemnitee for losses (e.g., damages, legal fees).  
     - **Hold Harmless**: Shield the Indemnitee from liability entirely (i.e., prevent the Indemnitee from bearing any financial burden for covered claims).  

2. **Scope of Coverage**:  
   The indemnification applies to three key scenarios:  
   - **Breach of contract** (failure to perform obligations under the agreement).  
   - **Negligence or fault** (personal injury/property damage caused by the Indemnitor).  
   - **IP infringement** (third-party claims over patents, trademarks, etc.).  

3. **Exclusions**:  
   - Section 12.2 carves out exceptions, clarifying that **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits) are **not** covered unless tied to the specific claims in 12.1.  

### **Connection to External Information**:  
While the external excerpts focus on **enforcement** (e.g., injunctive relief for breaches), they indirectly support the indemnification clause by emphasizing:  
- The parties’ intent to **protect their interests** (mirroring the ""hold harmless"" intent).  
- That monetary damages may be inadequate, justifying equitable remedies (similar to how indemnification preemptively allocates liability).  

### **Key Takeaway**:  
This clause is a **textbook example** of an indemnification provision with ""hold harmless"" language, clearly defining:  
- **Who is protected** (Indemnitee, including affiliates).  
- **What triggers coverage** (specific claims like breach, negligence, IP issues).  
- **What is excluded** (consequential damages).

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 11.4 IS INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTY UNDER SECTION 11.1 or 11.2, OR DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 12.
<omitted>
ARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless""** provisions. While the provided clause does not explicitly use the phrase ""hold harmless,"" it is still relevant to the query because:  

1. **Indemnification Clauses (Sections 11.1 & 11.2)**  
   - These sections (omitted in the provided text) likely outline each party's obligation to indemnify the other for certain losses, claims, or liabilities.  
   - Indemnification inherently includes a **""hold harmless""** obligation, meaning one party agrees to protect the other from legal/financial harm arising from specified risks.  

2. **Limitation of Liability (Section 11.4)**  
   - While this section excludes certain damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential damages), it **explicitly preserves indemnification rights** under Sections 11.1 and 11.2.  
   - This reinforces that indemnification (and thus the implied ""hold harmless"" protection) remains enforceable even where other liability is limited.  

3. **Confidentiality Exception**  
   - The clause clarifies that damages for breaches of confidentiality (Article 12) are **not limited**, meaning indemnification/hold harmless protections still apply to such breaches.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause is relevant because:  
- It **preserves indemnification obligations**, which inherently include ""hold harmless"" protections.  
- It **carves out exceptions** (e.g., confidentiality breaches) where indemnification remains fully enforceable.  
- While ""hold harmless"" language isn’t explicitly stated, indemnification clauses in contracts typically function as **de facto hold-harmless agreements**.  

For a stricter ""hold harmless"" clause, you might expect explicit wording like:  
*""Party A shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Party B from any claims arising from...""*  
However, the provided clause achieves a similar effect through indemnification obligations.

2. Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that do not include ""hold harmless""**—meaning clauses where indemnification is provided without explicitly stating that the indemnified party will be ""held harmless"" from liabilities or claims.  

### Relevance of the Provided Clause to the Query:  
The clause you provided **does include ""hold harmless""** (e.g., *""indemnify and hold one another harmless""*), so it is **not** an example of an indemnification clause that omits ""hold harmless."" Instead, it combines both indemnification and hold-harmless obligations, which is common in many contracts.  

### Key Observations:  
1. **Indemnification + Hold Harmless**  
   - The clause requires each party to both **indemnify** (compensate for losses) and **hold harmless** (protect from legal claims).  
   - This is a **broader protection** than indemnification alone, as ""hold harmless"" can prevent claims from being brought in the first place.  

2. **Query Contrast**  
   - If the query seeks clauses where indemnification exists **without** ""hold harmless,"" this clause does not fit.  
   - An example of an indemnification-only clause might say:  
     *""MICOA shall indemnify Agency for any losses arising from MICOA’s negligence.""* (No mention of ""hold harmless."")  

3. **Legal Implications**  
   - Some jurisdictions treat ""indemnify"" and ""hold harmless"" as distinct obligations, while others merge them.  
   - Omitting ""hold harmless"" may limit the scope of protection (e.g., only covering reimbursement, not legal defense costs).  

### Suggested Revision for Query Alignment:

Here’s the relevance breakdown:

### 1. **Clause Analysis**  
The clause states:  
> *""Each Party ('Indemnifying Party') shall **indemnify, hold harmless, and defend** the other Party...""*  

This is a **broad indemnification clause** that:  
- **Includes ""hold harmless""**: The clause explicitly uses the term, which is contrary to the query’s focus on clauses *excluding* it.  
- Covers a wide range of liabilities (e.g., negligence, breaches, IP violations).  
- Combines indemnification with defense obligations.  

### 2. **Key Distinction in the Query**  
The query seeks clauses where indemnification is **not paired with ""hold harmless.""** Such clauses might:  
- Only use ""indemnify"" or ""defend"" without ""hold harmless.""  
- Limit the scope to financial reimbursement (indemnity) without absolving liability (hold harmless).  

### 3. **External Context**  
The provided external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief** but do not address indemnification. They highlight remedies for breaches but are unrelated to the indemnification language in the query.  

### 4. **Conclusion**  
The clause is **not relevant** to the query because it includes ""hold harmless."" For clauses that align with the query, you’d need examples where:  
- Only ""indemnify"" is used (e.g., *""Party A shall indemnify Party B for losses...""*).  
- ""Hold harmless"" is omitted intentionally to narrow the scope of protection.

indemnification clauses that do not include hold harmless,ca78a8476d,"The foregoing indemnities shall expressly exclude any liability for consequential, punitive, special or similar damages, including, without limitation, lost profits.","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that do not include ""hold harmless""**—a common phrase in indemnity provisions where one party agrees to protect another from losses, claims, or damages. The provided clause is an example of a **limitation on indemnification** rather than a full indemnification or hold harmless obligation. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Points:
1. **No ""Hold Harmless"" Language**:  
   - The clause does not include traditional ""hold harmless"" phrasing (e.g., ""Party A shall indemnify and hold harmless Party B""). Instead, it **carves out exclusions** (consequential, punitive, or special damages) from indemnifiable liabilities.  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on indemnification clauses that omit ""hold harmless"" language.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - The clause narrows the scope of indemnification by **excluding certain types of damages** (e.g., lost profits). This is a **limitation** rather than an affirmative obligation to indemnify or hold harmless.  
   - It implies that indemnification may exist for other liabilities but is silent on broader protections like ""hold harmless.""

3. **Relevance to External Context**:  
   - The external information discusses **specific performance** and equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but does not address indemnification directly. However, it underscores that parties may limit remedies (e.g., excluding certain damages), which is consistent with the clause’s exclusionary approach.  

### Why This Matters:  
- The clause is a **negative stipulation** (what indemnification *does not cover*) rather than a positive obligation to ""hold harmless.""  
- It reflects a drafting choice to **limit liability** without invoking the broader protections typically associated with ""hold harmless"" language.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is relevant to the query because it demonstrates how indemnification can be structured **without ""hold harmless"" language**, focusing instead on exclusions. It highlights that indemnification clauses can exist independently of ""hold harmless"" obligations, serving as a liability cap rather than a comprehensive protection.

Here’s the breakdown:

### Relevance to the Query:
1. **""Hold Harmless"" Language**:  
   - The clause states:  
     *""Each Party... will defend, indemnify **and hold the other Party... harmless** from and against any and all losses...""*  
   - This explicitly combines **indemnification** with **hold harmless**, which is the opposite of what the query seeks (clauses *without* ""hold harmless"").  

2. **Key Components of the Clause**:  
   - **Indemnification Scope**: Covers losses from breaches, negligence, or IP infringement (Section 12.1).  
   - **Exclusions**: Explicitly carves out liability for indirect/consequential damages (Section 12.2).  
   - **Hold Harmless Obligation**: The indemnitor agrees to protect the indemnitee from claims (not just reimburse).  

3. **Contrast with Query**:  
   - The query likely seeks clauses where indemnification is **limited to reimbursement** (e.g., ""indemnify for losses"" without ""hold harmless""). This clause, however, uses broader language that shifts both **financial responsibility and legal liability** to the indemnitor.  

### Why This Matters:  
- **""Hold harmless""** implies assuming liability for claims *before* they result in losses (proactive protection).  
- **Indemnification alone** (without ""hold harmless"") might only require reimbursement *after* losses occur.  

### Suggested Refinement for Query:  
If the goal is to find indemnification clauses *without* ""hold harmless,"" you might search for language like:  
- *""Party A agrees to indemnify Party B for losses arising from...""* (omitting ""hold harmless"").  
- Alternatively, clauses that specify **reimbursement** without assuming ongoing liability.  

The provided clause is a **counterexample** to the query’s intent, illustrating how ""hold harmless"" expands indemnification obligations. For clauses *excluding* this term, focus on narrower indemnification wording.

ARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY","The query asks about **indemnification clauses that do not include ""hold harmless""** language. The provided clause (Sections 11.1, 11.2, and 11.4) is relevant because it demonstrates an indemnification framework without explicitly incorporating the term ""hold harmless,"" which is often paired with indemnification in contracts. Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Observations:
1. **Indemnification Without ""Hold Harmless""**  
   - Sections 11.1 and 11.2 outline indemnification obligations for each party but do not use the phrase ""hold harmless.""  
   - Typically, indemnification clauses include both ""indemnify"" and ""hold harmless"" to cover both liability for damages (indemnify) and protection from future claims (hold harmless). Here, only ""indemnification"" is specified.

2. **Limitation of Liability (Section 11.4)**  
   - This section excludes certain damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential damages) but carves out exceptions for:  
     - Indemnification rights/obligations under Sections 11.1 and 11.2.  
     - Breaches of confidentiality (Article 12).  
   - The carve-out confirms that indemnification survives the liability cap, but the absence of ""hold harmless"" suggests the clause is narrower in scope—focused on reimbursement rather than broader protection against claims.

3. **Comparison to External Examples**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not address indemnification.  
   - The provided clause fills a gap by showing how indemnification can stand alone without ""hold harmless"" or equitable relief language.

### Why This Matters:  
- **Drafting Intent**: The clause may reflect a deliberate choice to limit indemnification to monetary reimbursement, avoiding broader ""hold harmless"" obligations that could extend to legal defense or third-party claims.  
- **Risk Allocation**: Without ""hold harmless,"" the indemnifying party’s duty may not include shielding the indemnified party from direct claims by others (e.g., regulators or third parties).  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a clear example of **indemnification stripped of ""hold harmless"" language**, making it responsive to the query. It highlights how parties might narrow indemnification scope while still addressing liability for breaches (e.g., confidentiality) and excluding certain damages. For full protection, parties often combine both terms; their absence here could create interpretive risks.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Elements Addressing the Query:
1. **Defense Obligation**:  
   The clause states that the Indemnitor will **""defend, indemnify, and hold harmless""** the Indemnitee. The inclusion of ""defend"" means the Indemnitor must actively handle legal claims (e.g., by hiring counsel, managing litigation) brought against the Indemnitee, not just reimburse losses after the fact.

2. **Scope of Covered Claims**:  
   The indemnification and defense obligations apply to three categories of claims:  
   - **(a)** Breach of the agreement (e.g., failure to perform obligations or warranties).  
   - **(b)** Personal injury or property damage caused by the Indemnitor’s negligence.  
   - **(c)** Third-party intellectual property infringement claims.  
   This broad coverage ensures the Indemnitee is protected from both contractual and tort-based liabilities.

3. **Hold Harmless and Indemnification**:  
   The clause covers **""all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees)""**, emphasizing that the Indemnitor bears the financial burden of defending and resolving claims.

4. **Exclusions (Section 12.2)**:  
   While the clause broadly covers defense and indemnity, it carves out exceptions for indirect/consequential damages (unless tied to the claims under Section 12.1), which is typical in limiting liability.

### Connection to External Information:  
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not address indemnification. However, they highlight the parties’ intent to enforce obligations strictly, which aligns with the indemnification clause’s purpose of ensuring compliance and compensating for breaches/claims.  

### Why This Matters:  
This clause is a robust example of an indemnification provision that includes **defense duties**, ensuring the Indemnitee is shielded from both legal costs and liability for covered claims. It balances broad protection with clear exclusions, reducing ambiguity about the Indemnitor’s responsibilities.  

**Key Takeaway**: The clause satisfies the query by demonstrating how indemnification clauses can explicitly incorporate defense obligations, detailing the types of claims covered and the scope of financial protection.",5

### **1. Defense Obligation**  
The clause states:  
> *""Each party will **defend, at its own expense**, indemnify and hold harmless the other party and its Affiliates from and against any and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of any Third Party claim, suit or proceeding...""*  

This means:  
- The **indemnifying party** (the one responsible for indemnification) must **actively defend** the indemnified party against third-party claims.  
- The defense includes covering legal costs (e.g., attorneys' fees).  

### **2. Scope of Indemnification**  
The clause covers claims arising from:  
- **Breach of covenants, representations, or warranties** (e.g., failure to perform obligations under the agreement).  
- **Negligence or willful misconduct** by the indemnifying party.  
- **Specific liabilities** (e.g., product liability, IP infringement, false representations by Depomed’s sales force).  

### **3. Control of Defense & Settlement Rights**  
- The **indemnifying party has sole control** over the defense and settlement of claims.  
- However, **settlements requiring admission of liability or imposing obligations on the indemnified party require prior written consent**.  
- The indemnified party may **participate in the defense** at its own expense.  

### **4. Notice & Cooperation Requirements**  
- The indemnified party must **promptly notify** the indemnifying party of any claim.  
- The indemnified party must provide **assistance** in the defense.  

### **5. Survival Period**  
- The indemnification obligations **survive termination for three years** (or longer if a claim is pending).  

### **Comparison with External References**  
While the external references (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 10.12**) discuss **equitable remedies (injunctions, specific performance)**, they do not directly address **indemnification with defense obligations**.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is a **strong example of an indemnification provision that includes a duty to defend**, as it:  
✔ Explicitly requires the indemnifying party to **actively defend** claims.  
✔ Covers **legal costs** (attorneys' fees).  
✔ Grants **control over litigation** while protecting the indemnified party’s interests.  
✔ Ensures **survival of obligations** post-termination.  

Thus, it fully aligns with the query regarding indemnification clauses that include **defending claims**.",5
indemnification clauses that include defending claims,32762b4bf5,"ARTICLE 9 - INDEMNIFICATION
Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;
(4) If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, with a reservation of all rights to seek indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party; provided, that Indemnitee may enter into a settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the indemnifying party, if the terms of such settlement (i) include only money damages as a remedy, (ii) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on the indemnifying party's business and (iii) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by the indemnifying party; and
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The **indemnification clause** provided in **Article 9** is highly relevant to the query regarding **indemnification clauses that include defending claims** because it explicitly outlines the obligations of the indemnifying party to **defend** claims in addition to indemnifying the other party. Below is a breakdown of its key aspects related to defending claims:

### **1. Duty to Defend (Section 9.1(a))**
- The clause requires the indemnifying party to **""indemnify, defend, and hold harmless""** the other party against third-party claims.  
- The **defense obligation** is triggered by actual or threatened claims arising from:  
  - Breach of the agreement  
  - Negligence or willful misconduct  

### **2. Control Over Defense (Section 9.1(b)(1)-(2))**
- The indemnifying party has the **right to control the defense** of any asserted liability, including:  
  - Selecting **legal counsel** (subject to Indemnitee’s reasonable approval)  
  - Managing **settlement negotiations** (in consultation with the Indemnitee)  
  - Conducting **litigation strategy**  

### **3. Settlement Restrictions (Section 9.1(b)(3)-(4))**
- The indemnifying party **cannot settle without Indemnitee’s consent** unless:  
  - The settlement involves **only monetary damages** (paid by the indemnifying party)  
  - It does **not impose material obligations** on the Indemnitee  
  - It does **not include an admission of wrongdoing** by the Indemnitee  
- If the indemnifying party **refuses to defend**, the Indemnitee can take over the defense while preserving indemnification rights.  

### **4. Right to Participate in Defense (Section 9.1(b)(5))**
- Both the **Indemnitee and indemnifying party** may participate in the defense at their own expense.  

### **Comparison with External Information**
The external references (e.g., **Section 8.5 and Section 9.10**) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable remedies** (like injunctions) but do not directly address **defense obligations** in indemnification. The provided clause, however, **explicitly details** how defense obligations work, making it directly responsive to the query.  

### **Conclusion**
This indemnification clause is **highly relevant** because it:  
✔ **Mandates defense** alongside indemnification  
✔ **Specifies procedures** for handling claims  
✔ **Balances control** between the indemnifying party and Indemnitee  
✔ **Restricts settlements** to protect the Indemnitee  

Thus, it serves as a **comprehensive example** of an indemnification clause that includes **defending claims**.",5
indemnification clauses that include defending claims,433bb528fe,"7. Indemnification. a. A claim that a Party (referred to at times in this Section as an ""Indemnifying Party"") is required to defend and indemnify the other Party (referred to at times in this Section as an ""Indemnified Party"") under this Agreement is referred to at times in this Section as an ""Indemnified Claim"". Defense and indemnification under this Section will include, without limitation, (1) paying or reimbursing the actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement of any civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, arbitration, mediation, hearing, audit, investigation or other proceeding threatened or commenced against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim (e.g., fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants, auditors, investigators, consulting experts, testifying experts and other consultants; fees and expenses of an arbitrator or mediator; filing fees and costs imposed by any court, administrative agency or other tribunal; etc.), and (2) satisfying any judgment, award, order, lien, levy, fine, penalty or other sanction imposed against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim. b. Seller will defend and indemnify Buyer against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Seller, including, without limitation, any product supplied by Seller which fails to conform to the representations and warranties in this Agreement; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Seller in the design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery of any product sold by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Seller under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, packaging, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement (except to the extent that the infringement is based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license terms in supplying the product); (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by a governmental authority on Buyer to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Seller of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Seller has agreed to defend and indemnify Buyer against under a Purchase Schedule. c. Buyer will defend and indemnify Seller against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Buyer; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Buyer in the purchase, storage, repackaging, resale or delivery of any product purchased from Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Buyer under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement to the extent based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license term in supplying the product; (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by governmental authority on Seller to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Buyer of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Buyer has agreed to defend and indemnify Seller against under a Purchase Schedule. d. As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The **indemnification clause** provided is highly relevant to the query about clauses that include **defending claims**, as it explicitly outlines the obligations of the **Indemnifying Party** to both **defend and indemnify** the **Indemnified Party** against specified claims. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects Addressing the Query:
1. **Explicit Duty to Defend**  
   - The clause defines an ""Indemnified Claim"" as one where the Indemnifying Party must **defend and indemnify** the other party (Section 7.a).  
   - It details the scope of defense, including covering expenses like legal fees, expert costs, and court fees (Section 7.a(1)–(2)).  

2. **Specific Claims Covered**  
   - **Seller’s obligations** (Section 7.b): Includes defending Buyer against third-party claims for breaches, negligence, IP infringement, regulatory violations, and other agreed matters.  
   - **Buyer’s obligations** (Section 7.c): Similarly covers claims arising from Buyer’s breaches, negligence, or IP issues tied to licensed property.  

3. **Procedural Requirements for Defense**  
   - The Indemnified Party must **notify and tender defense** to the Indemnifying Party promptly (Section 7.d(1)).  
   - The Indemnifying Party **controls the defense** (including selecting counsel and settling claims) but must act in good faith (Section 7.e(2)).  

4. **Settlement Mechanisms**  
   - For IP infringement claims, the Indemnifying Party can settle by obtaining licenses, modifying products, or withdrawing infringing items (Section 7.f).  

5. **Conflict Resolution**  
   - If parties dispute liability or face conflicts, they must negotiate in good faith or pursue separate defenses while preserving reimbursement rights (Section 7.g).  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts focus on **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, the indemnification clause complements these by addressing **monetary and defensive remedies** for third-party claims. Together, they ensure:  
- **Specific performance** (external clauses) for contractual breaches.  
- **Defense and financial protection** (indemnification clause) for external claims.  

### Why It Matters:  
This clause is a robust example of **defense-inclusive indemnification**, ensuring the Indemnifying Party actively manages claims (not just reimburses costs), which is critical for risk allocation in contracts. The procedural rigor (notice, control, cooperation) aligns with best practices to avoid gaps in protection.

indemnification clauses that include defending claims,a1f2e7f3dd,"12. Indemnification. VS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PPD, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any claim, action or proceeding by a third party (a ""Third Party Claim"") arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The **indemnification clause** provided is directly relevant to the query about clauses that include **defending claims**, as it explicitly outlines the obligations of both parties (VS and PPD) to not only **indemnify** (compensate for losses) but also to **defend** against third-party claims. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Elements Addressing the Query:
1. **Indemnification + Defense Obligation**:  
   - Both parties agree to **""indemnify, defend, and hold harmless""** the other for third-party claims arising from negligence, misconduct, or breach of the agreement.  
   - The inclusion of **""defend""** means the indemnifying party must actively manage legal proceedings (e.g., hiring counsel, filing motions) in addition to covering costs.

2. **Control of Defense**:  
   - The indemnifying party has the **right to control the defense and settlement** of the claim, provided they act reasonably and in good faith.  
   - This ensures the party financially responsible can direct the legal strategy, reducing the risk of unnecessary costs or unfavorable outcomes.

3. **Indemnified Party’s Rights**:  
   - The indemnified party may **participate in (but not control)** the defense and hire separate counsel at its own expense, unless:  
     - The indemnifying party authorizes the expense, or  
     - The indemnifying party fails to assume the defense (shifting control to the indemnified party).  
   - This balances control while protecting the indemnified party’s interests.

4. **Notice and Cooperation**:  
   - The indemnified party must provide **prompt notice** of claims, and both parties must **cooperate reasonably** in the defense.  
   - This ensures timely action and avoids prejudice to the indemnifying party’s ability to defend.

### Why It Matches the Query:  
The clause explicitly integrates **defense obligations** into indemnification, addressing scenarios where legal proceedings (not just financial compensation) are required. It clarifies:  
- Who controls the defense.  
- How costs are allocated.  
- Rights of both parties during litigation.  

### Contrast with External Information:  
The external examples (about **specific performance** and injunctions) are unrelated to indemnification/defense. They deal with remedies for breach (e.g., court orders to enforce performance), whereas the provided clause focuses on **third-party claims** and litigation management.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a **direct response** to the query, as it comprehensively covers indemnification **including defense**—detailing control, costs, and procedural requirements for third-party claims.

indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,c3e38c985d,"11. Indemnification: Each Party agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party, its officers, directors, employees, volunteers, subcontractors and agents, from any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, or settlements, including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses incurred on account of the their respective negligent acts or omissions, and those of their directors, employees, agents, contractors and sub- contractors, in connection with this Agreement.","The provided **indemnification clause** does **not** explicitly address the query regarding whether the **indemnifying party has the right to control defenses** (e.g., selecting legal counsel, directing litigation strategy).  

### Key Observations:  
1. **Standard Indemnification Language**  
   - The clause requires one party to **defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the other party against claims arising from negligence.  
   - However, it does **not specify** whether the indemnifying party has the **right to assume control** of the defense (e.g., appointing defense counsel, making settlement decisions).  

2. **Missing Control Provision**  
   - A typical **""control of defense""** clause would include language such as:  
     - *""The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to assume and control the defense of any claim with counsel of its choice.""*  
     - *""The indemnified party shall cooperate in such defense at the indemnifying party’s expense.""*  
   - Without such language, the indemnified party may retain control unless otherwise agreed or implied by law.  

3. **Relevance to Query**  
   - Since the clause is silent on **who controls the defense**, the default legal interpretation (depending on jurisdiction) may either:  
     - Allow the indemnifying party to take over the defense (implied duty to defend), or  
     - Permit the indemnified party to manage the defense and later seek reimbursement.  

### Suggested Revision for Clarity:  
To explicitly grant the indemnifying party control, the clause could be amended as follows:  
> *""The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to assume and control the defense of any claim with counsel of its choosing. The indemnified party shall provide reasonable cooperation in such defense. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnified party may retain separate counsel at its own expense.""*  

### Conclusion:  
The current clause **does not satisfy the query** because it lacks explicit language on defense control. If the intent is to allow the indemnifying party to direct the defense, a more detailed provision should be added.  

Would you like me to draft a revised indemnification clause with defense control rights?",5
indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,988610fe80,"Section 9.1 Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX, each Party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the ""Indemnified Parties"") from and against all Losses imposed upon or incurred by an Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of or resulting from the Indemnifying Party's or its Affiliates' material breach of this Agreement, except to the extent that such Losses are primarily caused by the Indemnified Party.","The **indemnification clause** you provided (Section 9.1) is relevant to the query about allowing the **indemnifying party to control defenses** in the following ways:

### 1. **Right to Defend**  
The clause states that the Indemnifying Party agrees to **""indemnify, defend, and hold harmless""** the Indemnified Parties. The inclusion of **""defend""** implies that the Indemnifying Party has the **right to assume control of the defense** against any claims covered by the indemnification obligation. This is a common feature in indemnification clauses where the party responsible for covering losses also has the authority to manage legal defenses.

### 2. **Scope of Control**  
Since the Indemnifying Party is obligated to cover **""all Losses""** arising from its breach, it logically follows that it should have the ability to direct the legal strategy, including selecting counsel, settling claims, or contesting liability. This ensures that the Indemnifying Party can mitigate its exposure rather than being bound by decisions made by the Indemnified Party.

### 3. **Limitations & Exceptions**  
The clause includes an exception where indemnification does not apply if the Losses are **""primarily caused by the Indemnified Party.""** This suggests that if the Indemnified Party’s actions contributed significantly to the claim, the Indemnifying Party’s control over defenses could be limited or negated.  

### 4. **Connection to External References**  
While the external references (Sections 8.5 and 9.11) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief**, they reinforce the broader contractual principle that parties have remedies for breaches. However, they do not directly address indemnification defense control. Instead, your clause fills that gap by explicitly granting the Indemnifying Party the right to **""defend,""** which aligns with the query’s focus on defense control.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause is relevant because it:  
- Explicitly includes **""defend""** as part of the indemnifying party’s obligations, implying control over legal defenses.  
- Limits indemnification where the Indemnified Party is primarily at fault, indirectly affecting defense control.  
- Operates alongside (but does not conflict with) the external clauses on equitable remedies.  

For full clarity, the clause could be enhanced by **explicitly stating** that the Indemnifying Party has the **right to assume and conduct the defense** of any claim, subject to certain conditions (e.g., approval of settlements). Would you like suggested language for such an addition?",5
indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,b961c3c348,"7. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party (the ""Indemnified Party"") from and against any and all claims, damages, and liabilities, including any and all expense and costs, legal or otherwise, caused by the negligent act or omission of the Indemnifying Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees, incurred by the Indemnified Party in the investigation and defense of any claim, demand, or action arising out of the work performed under this Agreement; including breach of the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claims, damages, or liabilities caused by the sole negligence of the Indemnified Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees. The Indemnified Party shall notify promptly the Indemnifying Party of the existence of any claim, demand, or other matter to which the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations would apply, and shall give them a reasonable opportunity to settle or defend the same at their own expense and with counsel of their own selection, provided that the Indemnified Party shall at all times also have the right to fully participate in the defense. If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after this notice, fails to take appropriate steps to settle or defend the claim, demand, or the matter, the Indemnified Party shall, upon written notice, have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake such settlement or defense and to compromise or settle the claim, demand, or other matter on behalf, for the account, and at the risk, of the Indemnifying Party. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Article shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, and heirs of the Parties.","The query asks for an **indemnification clause that allows the indemnifying party to control defenses**. The provided clause (Section 7: **Indemnification**) is directly relevant because it explicitly grants the **Indemnifying Party** the right to manage the defense of claims, subject to certain conditions. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Provisions Addressing Control of Defenses:
1. **Right to Settle or Defend**:  
   - The clause states that the **Indemnified Party** must notify the **Indemnifying Party** of any claim and provide them a **""reasonable opportunity to settle or defend the same at their own expense and with counsel of their own selection.""**  
   - This grants the Indemnifying Party primary control over the defense strategy, including choice of counsel and settlement decisions.

2. **Conditional Default**:  
   - If the Indemnifying Party fails to act **""within a reasonable time""** after notice, the Indemnified Party may step in to defend or settle the claim (but is not obligated to do so).  
   - This ensures the Indemnifying Party’s control is forfeited only if they neglect their duty, preserving their default authority.

3. **Participation Rights for Indemnified Party**:  
   - While the Indemnifying Party controls the defense, the Indemnified Party retains the right to **""fully participate in the defense""** (e.g., monitoring, providing input).  
   - This balances control with the Indemnified Party’s interest in protecting its rights.

### Relevance to External Context:  
The external excerpts (e.g., **specific performance** clauses) emphasize equitable remedies for breaches but do not conflict with the indemnification clause. The indemnification clause operates independently, focusing on **procedural control** during disputes, while the external clauses address **post-breach judicial remedies**.

### Why This Meets the Query:  
The clause satisfies the request by:  
- Clearly assigning **defense control** to the Indemnifying Party.  
- Outlining **conditions** for retaining or losing that control.  
- Allowing the Indemnified Party to intervene only if the Indemnifying Party is inactive.  

This structure is typical in contracts to ensure the party financially responsible for claims (the Indemnifying Party) can manage risks effectively.",5

1. **Right to Defend**:  
   The clause states that the Indemnifying Party agrees to **""indemnify, defend, and hold harmless""** the Indemnified Parties. The inclusion of **""defend""** suggests that the Indemnifying Party has the authority to take charge of legal defenses, including selecting counsel, directing litigation strategy, and settling claims (unless otherwise restricted).

2. **Scope of Control**:  
   The Indemnifying Party’s control is tied to claims arising from:  
   - Its **breach of the agreement** or  
   - Its **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  

3. **Implications of Control**:  
   - The Indemnifying Party assumes responsibility for legal costs and liabilities.  
   - The Indemnified Parties are protected from losses but may have limited say in how the defense is conducted (unless the clause is supplemented with conditions, such as approval rights for settlements).  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts (e.g., Section 10.12 on enforcement/specific performance) don’t directly address indemnification, they highlight the agreement’s emphasis on **legal remedies and equitable relief**. This context supports the enforceability of the indemnification clause, including the Indemnifying Party’s defense rights.  

### Suggested Refinements (if needed):  
To **explicitly** clarify control, the clause could be expanded to state:  
> *""The Indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to assume and control the defense of any claim, subject to the Indemnified Party’s right to approve any settlement (if such approval is desired).""*  

However, as drafted, the clause already implies defense control through the **""defend""** obligation.  

**Conclusion**: This clause satisfies the query by granting the Indemnifying Party the right to manage defenses, though it could be made more explicit. The broader agreement context (e.g., specific performance) reinforces its enforceability.",5
indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,6febf32b96,"10. INDEMNIFICATION
10.1 Indemnification. Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their
respective employees, directors, officers, agents and successors (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all losses (including all costs,
liabilities (including present and future damages), claims and expenses) incurred or suffered by any of the Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising
out of, relating to or resulting from (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement; or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement.","The provided indemnification clause (Section 10.1) does **not** explicitly address the query about allowing the **indemnifying party to control defenses**. Here’s the relevance and gap:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Indemnification Obligation**:  
   - The Indemnifying Party must indemnify the Indemnified Parties for losses arising from breaches, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.  
   - It includes defending the Indemnified Parties (e.g., ""indemnify, defend, and hold harmless"").  

2. **Missing Control Provision**:  
   - While the clause imposes a duty to ""defend,"" it does **not specify whether the Indemnifying Party has the right to assume control of the defense** (e.g., selecting legal counsel, directing litigation strategy, or settling claims).  
   - Typically, such control rights are explicitly stated (e.g., ""The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume sole control of the defense, including settlement, at its expense"").  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause is **relevant but incomplete** for the query because:  
- It establishes a duty to defend but lacks procedural details about **who controls the defense**.  
- Without explicit language, disputes may arise over whether the Indemnifying Party can dictate defense strategies or settlements.  

### Suggested Addition:  
To align with the query, the clause could be amended to include language like:  
> *""The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to assume and control the defense of any claim for which indemnification is sought, including the selection of legal counsel and settlement of the claim, provided such settlement does not impose liability or obligations on the Indemnified Parties without their prior written consent.""*  

### External Context:  
The provided external clauses (about **specific performance** and **enforcement**) are unrelated to indemnification defense control. They address equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not inform the indemnification mechanics.  

**Conclusion**: The current clause is a foundation but needs explicit terms about defense control to fully address the query.",4
Indemnity of broad-based claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The **indemnification clause (Section 10)** is relevant to the query about **""indemnity of broad-based claims""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
The clause broadly covers **""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses""** arising from breaches of warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements in the agreement. This language is intentionally **wide-ranging**, ensuring that indemnification applies to a **broad spectrum of claims**, including those that may not be immediately foreseeable.  

### 2. **Connection to External Provisions**  
The external references (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 10.12**) emphasize **equitable remedies** (injunctions, specific performance) for breaches, but they also acknowledge that monetary damages may not always suffice. The indemnification clause complements these provisions by ensuring that **financial compensation** (via indemnification) is available for losses stemming from breaches, even if equitable relief is also pursued.  

### 3. **Protection Against Uncertain or Evolving Claims**  
The clause allows the **non-indemnifying party** to withhold payments pending resolution of a claim, which is particularly useful for **broad-based or speculative claims** where the full extent of liability is unclear. This mitigates risk by ensuring funds are available to cover potential indemnification obligations.  

### 4. **Legal Costs and Attorneys’ Fees**  
The inclusion of **legal costs and attorneys’ fees** ensures that the indemnifying party covers not just the claim itself but also the expenses of defending against it—critical for broad claims that may involve protracted litigation.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause is **highly relevant** to broad-based claims because:  
- It uses expansive language to cover a wide range of liabilities.  
- It works alongside equitable remedies (referenced externally) to provide comprehensive protection.  
- It includes mechanisms (like payment withholding) to manage uncertain or evolving claims.  
- It ensures full cost recovery, including legal fees, which is essential for defending against broad allegations.  

Thus, it serves as a **risk-shifting mechanism** for claims that may be wide in scope or difficult to quantify at the outset.",5
Indemnity of broad-based claims,596576fcc8,"Section 5.04 Limitations. The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under this Agreement shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall […***…] for such claims until the […***…] of the […***…] shall […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the […***…] of the [… ***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], and (ii) the Indemnifying Party's […***…] for [… ***…] shall not […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…]. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 5.04, the limitations provided in this Section 5.04 shall not apply to (i) any claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (ii) any claim for breach of any agreement or covenant contained herein.","The query concerns **""indemnity of broad-based claims,""** which generally refers to the scope and limitations of indemnification obligations for a wide range of potential claims. The provided **Section 5.04 (Limitations)** is directly relevant because it outlines the boundaries of the Indemnifying Party's liability, including carve-outs for certain types of claims. Here’s how it relates:

### Key Relevance to Broad-Based Claims:
1. **Limitations on Liability**  
   - The clause imposes financial caps or thresholds (redacted here as `[...***...]`) on the Indemnifying Party’s liability for claims under the agreement. This is typical in indemnity provisions to prevent unlimited exposure to broad-based claims (e.g., third-party claims, breaches of representations/warranties).  
   - For example, liability might be triggered only after aggregate claims exceed a minimum threshold (a ""basket"") or be capped at a maximum amount (a ""cap"").

2. **Exceptions to Limitations**  
   - The limitations **do not apply** to:  
     - **Fraud or intentional misrepresentation**: Broad-based claims involving bad faith are typically excluded from indemnity caps to deter misconduct.  
     - **Breach of covenants or agreements**: Ongoing obligations (e.g., post-closing covenants) are often treated more strictly than representations/warranties, so limitations may not apply.  

3. **Context from External Clauses**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 10.12**) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, reinforcing that certain breaches (like covenant violations) may bypass standard indemnity limitations. This aligns with Section 5.04’s carve-outs for breaches of covenants.  

### Why This Matters for Broad-Based Claims:
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause ensures that the Indemnifying Party is not liable for every minor claim (e.g., de minimis losses) but remains on the hook for significant misconduct (fraud) or ongoing obligations (covenants).  
- **Predictability**: By setting limits, the parties can quantify exposure for broad indemnity claims while preserving recourse for egregious acts.  

### Drafting Consideration:
If the query seeks to expand or restrict indemnity for broad claims, negotiators might:  
- Define the **thresholds/caps** (e.g., monetary baskets) more clearly.  
- Clarify whether **indemnity covers third-party claims** (implied but not explicit here).  
- Address **time limits** (e.g., survival periods for claims), which are absent in this excerpt.  

In summary, **Section 5.04** is a critical guardrail for indemnity scope, balancing protection against broad claims while ensuring accountability for severe breaches.",5
Indemnity of broad-based claims,16553eaa2d,"20. INDEMNITY AND INSURANCE. Berkshire shall indemnify and hold Auriemma harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys', consultants' and experts' fees) (collectively, ""Claims"") arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy or breach of Berkshire's representations, warranties, covenants or any claim or other cause of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including actions based upon gross negligence of Berkshire under this Agreement, provided that Berkshire shall be given prompt notice of any such action or claim.","The **indemnity clause** you provided is relevant to the query on **""indemnity of broad-based claims""** because it broadly covers a wide range of potential liabilities that Berkshire may face, ensuring Auriemma is protected from various legal and financial risks. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of broad-based indemnification:

### **1. Scope of Indemnified Claims**  
The clause covers:  
- **Inaccuracies or breaches** of Berkshire’s representations, warranties, or covenants.  
- **Any claim or cause of action** related to the agreement (a broad catch-all).  
- **Gross negligence** by Berkshire (extending beyond mere contractual breaches).  

This **wide coverage** ensures that Auriemma is protected against not just contractual breaches but also **tort-based claims (e.g., negligence) and other legal actions** tied to the agreement.

### **2. Broad Definition of Losses**  
The indemnity includes:  
- **Legal costs** (attorneys’, consultants’, experts’ fees).  
- **Various damages** (losses, suits, proceedings).  

This ensures **comprehensive financial protection** for Auriemma, not just direct damages but also litigation expenses.

### **3. Comparison with External References**  
- The **M&A clause (maud_102)** discusses **equitable remedies (injunctions, specific performance)** but does not focus on indemnification.  
- The **representations & warranties clause (maud_576)** ensures accuracy at closing but is narrower than the indemnity clause here.  

Your clause is **broader** because it covers **both contractual and extra-contractual claims** (e.g., negligence), whereas the external references are more limited in scope.

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnity clause is **broad-based** because:  
✔ It covers **contractual breaches, negligence, and general claims** tied to the agreement.  
✔ It includes **legal costs and various damages**, not just direct losses.  
✔ It goes beyond typical **representations & warranties clauses** by encompassing **tort liability**.  

Thus, it effectively shields Auriemma from a **wide spectrum of risks** arising from Berkshire’s actions under the agreement.

Indemnity of broad-based claims,6a700c0c62,"EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","The clause you provided is a **limitation of liability provision** that specifically excludes certain types of damages (consequential, indirect, incidental, etc.) from being claimed by either party, **except** for indemnification obligations related to third-party claims under **Section 9**.  

### **Relevance to ""Indemnity of Broad-Based Claims"":**  
1. **Narrow Exception for Third-Party Claims**  
   - The clause carves out an exception for indemnification obligations under **Section 9**, meaning that **third-party claims** (e.g., lawsuits from external parties) are still subject to indemnification, even if they involve consequential or indirect damages.  
   - This ensures that broad-based claims (e.g., regulatory actions, intellectual property disputes, or tort claims from third parties) are still covered under indemnity, while limiting liability between the contracting parties themselves.  

2. **Broad Exclusion of Other Damages**  
   - For **direct claims between the parties** (not involving third parties), the clause **bars recovery** of consequential, indirect, punitive, or similar damages, **regardless of foreseeability or legal theory** (contract, tort, etc.).  
   - This prevents expansive liability exposure for broad-based claims (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or business disruption) unless they stem from third-party claims under Section 9.  

3. **Alignment with External References (Specific Performance)**  
   - The external references (e.g., MAUD_102 and MAUD_446) emphasize **equitable remedies** (injunction, specific performance) as key enforcement mechanisms, but they do not override the limitation of liability clause.  
   - The indemnity carve-out ensures that third-party claims (which often require broader protection) remain enforceable, while other damages are restricted.  

### **Key Takeaway:**  
This clause **limits liability for broad-based claims between the parties** (e.g., lost profits, punitive damages) but **preserves indemnity for third-party claims**, ensuring that external risks (like lawsuits or regulatory actions) are still covered under Section 9. This balances risk allocation while preventing excessive exposure to indirect damages in disputes between the contracting parties.

Defense and indemnification under this Section will include, without limitation, (1) paying or reimbursing the actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the investigation, defense and settlement of any civil, criminal or administrative action, suit, arbitration, mediation, hearing, audit, investigation or other proceeding threatened or commenced against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim (e.g., fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants, auditors, investigators, consulting experts, testifying experts and other consultants; fees and expenses of an arbitrator or mediator; filing fees and costs imposed by any court, administrative agency or other tribunal; etc.), and (2) satisfying any judgment, award, order, lien, levy, fine, penalty or other sanction imposed against an Indemnified Party on an Indemnified Claim. b. Seller will defend and indemnify Buyer against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Seller, including, without limitation, any product supplied by Seller which fails to conform to the representations and warranties in this Agreement; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Seller in the design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery of any product sold by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Seller under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, packaging, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement (except to the extent that the infringement is based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license terms in supplying the product); (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by a governmental authority on Buyer to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Seller of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Seller has agreed to defend and indemnify Buyer against under a Purchase Schedule. c. Buyer will defend and indemnify Seller against: (1) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged breach of this Agreement by Buyer; (2) any third-party claim for personal injury, damage to tangible property or other loss to the extent caused by any actual or alleged negligence or other legally culpable misconduct of Buyer in the purchase, storage, repackaging, resale or delivery of any product purchased from Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of other obligation of Buyer under this Agreement; (3) any third-party claim for actual or alleged infringement of a product sold by Seller under this Agreement or its design, manufacture, storage, sale or delivery by Seller under this Agreement or in the performance of any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement to the extent based on intellectual property that that Buyer has represented and warranted to Seller that Buyer owns and that Buyer has licensed to Seller and that Seller has used in compliance with the license term in supplying the product; (4) the threat or imposition of any fine, penalty or other sanction by governmental authority on Seller to the extent caused by any actual or alleged violation by Buyer of Applicable Law; or (5) any other matter that Buyer has agreed to defend and indemnify Seller against under a Purchase Schedule. d. As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The **Indemnification Clause (Section 7)** is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnity of broad-based claims""** because it comprehensively addresses the scope, process, and limitations of indemnification obligations between the parties (Seller and Buyer) for a wide range of third-party claims. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### 1. **Broad Coverage of Indemnified Claims**  
The clause defines an **""Indemnified Claim""** expansively to include:  
   - **Third-party claims** (e.g., personal injury, property damage, infringement, regulatory fines).  
   - **Diverse legal actions** (civil, criminal, administrative proceedings, arbitrations, etc.).  
   - **Costs** (attorneys’ fees, expert fees, court costs, settlements, judgments).  

This broad-based coverage ensures indemnification applies to virtually any claim arising from breaches, negligence, or statutory violations tied to the agreement.

### 2. **Allocation of Liability**  
The clause explicitly allocates responsibility between Seller and Buyer for specific scenarios:  
   - **Seller’s indemnity obligations** cover claims tied to its breaches, negligence, product defects, IP infringement (unless caused by Buyer’s licensed IP), and regulatory violations.  
   - **Buyer’s indemnity obligations** mirror these for its own breaches, negligence, or misuse of licensed IP.  

This structured allocation prevents ambiguity over which party bears liability for broad categories of claims.

### 3. **Procedural Safeguards**  
The clause includes detailed **conditions** for indemnification (e.g., prompt notice, cooperation, tender of defense) and **control mechanisms** (e.g., the Indemnifying Party’s right to direct defense and settlement). These provisions ensure orderly handling of claims while protecting both parties’ interests.

### 4. **Conflict Resolution for Disputed Claims**  
If parties dispute whether a claim qualifies for indemnification or how liability is shared (common in broad-based claims), the clause mandates **good-faith negotiations** and allows for separate defense if conflicts arise. This flexibility is critical for managing complex or overlapping claims.

### 5. **Equitable Remedies (Tie to External Context)**  
While the external information focuses on **injunctions** and **specific performance** for breaches, the indemnification clause complements these remedies by addressing **monetary compensation** for third-party claims. Together, they form a holistic risk-management framework:  
   - **Equitable relief** (from external clauses) enforces contractual performance.  
   - **Indemnification** (this clause) covers financial losses from claims.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause directly responds to the query by providing a robust mechanism to address **broad-based claims** through:  
- Clear liability allocation.  
- Comprehensive coverage of claim types.  
- Procedural rules to manage disputes.  
- Alignment with broader contractual remedies (e.g., equitable relief).  

It ensures both parties are protected against wide-ranging risks while maintaining enforceability.",5
Indemnified party includes affiliates,c30b9c337f,"During the term of this Agreement, Party B and its affiliates will be the exclusive cooperator of Party A's real estate and home furnishing cooperation channel. Party A grants all-round exclusive rights to Party B to construct, maintain and operate the Cooperation channel. Party B and its affiliates will be the exclusive provider of real estate and home furnishing information, products and data in Party A's real estate and home furnishing channel.","The query asks whether the **""indemnified party includes affiliates""** in a contractual context. While the provided external information does not directly address indemnification, the **clause** you shared demonstrates a contractual relationship where **Party B's affiliates** are explicitly included in the scope of rights and obligations (exclusivity, cooperation, and operational responsibilities).  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Affiliates as Contractual Parties**:  
   - The clause explicitly extends rights/obligations to Party B's affiliates, showing that affiliates can be integral to contractual terms.  
   - By analogy, if affiliates are included in operational/exclusivity clauses (as here), they may also be included in indemnification provisions unless expressly excluded.  

2. **Interpretation Principle**:  
   - Contracts often define ""indemnified party"" broadly to cover affiliates, especially where affiliates are active participants (as in this clause).  
   - The clause’s inclusion of affiliates supports the argument that indemnification could similarly extend to them, absent limiting language.  

3. **External Context**:  
   - The external excerpts highlight cooperation with ""Subsidiaries"" (a type of affiliate), reinforcing that affiliates are frequently bound by contractual terms.  

### Key Takeaway:  
While the clause does not mention indemnification, its treatment of affiliates suggests they are likely included in other protections (like indemnification) unless the contract states otherwise. Drafters should clarify this expressly to avoid ambiguity.

Here's the relevance:

1. **Definition of Indemnified Parties**:  
   The clause defines **""Indemnified Parties""** broadly to include:  
   - The **other Party** (i.e., the non-breaching party to the agreement),  
   - **Its Affiliates**, and  
   - A wide range of associated individuals/entities (directors, officers, employees, etc.).  

   This directly addresses the query by clarifying that affiliates are expressly included as beneficiaries of indemnification.

2. **Scope of Protection**:  
   The indemnification covers **Losses** arising from the **Indemnifying Party's or its Affiliates' material breach**, further reinforcing that affiliates of both sides (indemnifying and indemnified) are within the scope of the clause.  

3. **Link to External Context**:  
   While the external excerpts focus on **specific performance** (equitable remedies for breaches), they underscore the agreement’s emphasis on enforcing obligations. The indemnification clause complements this by providing **monetary protection** to affiliates if breaches occur.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause explicitly includes **affiliates** in the definition of **""Indemnified Parties""**, ensuring they are protected under the indemnification framework alongside the primary contracting party. This aligns with the query’s focus and reflects standard practice in contracts to extend protections to affiliated entities.",5

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 8.2 [No Consequential Damages] IS INTENDED TO LIMIT ANY RIGHT OF ACSI TO RECEIVE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.5.2 [Effect of Termination].","The query asks whether the **""Indemnified Party"" includes affiliates**, and the provided clause explicitly confirms that it does. Here’s the relevance:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Definition of ""Indemnified Party""**  
   - Section 7.2 states that the **""Indemnified Party""** includes not only the other contracting party but also **its Affiliates** (and their employees, directors, and representatives).  
   - Example: If Party A is the Indemnifying Party, Party B (the other Party) and Party B’s Affiliates are protected under the indemnity.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**  
   - The indemnity covers claims, costs, losses, etc., arising from third-party claims (excluding claims by Affiliates of either Party, as defined under **""Claim""**).  
   - The Indemnifying Party must pay awards or expenses incurred by the **Indemnified Party and its Affiliates**.

3. **Exclusion of Affiliate Claims**  
   - The definition of **""Claim""** explicitly excludes claims brought by an **Affiliate of a Party**, meaning indemnification does not cover disputes between the Parties’ own Affiliates.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **directly addresses the query** by clarifying that:  
  - Affiliates are **expressly included** as beneficiaries of the indemnity (as part of the ""Indemnified Party"").  
  - However, claims *by* Affiliates are excluded from triggering indemnification (since they are not third-party claims).  

### Additional Context from External Information:
While the external excerpts focus on **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) and jurisdiction, they do not contradict the indemnity clause. The indemnity clause stands independently, but the external sections reinforce that:  
- Parties prioritize **specific enforcement** of terms (e.g., indemnification obligations).  
- Remedies are **cumulative**, so indemnity rights coexist with other legal/equitable remedies.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **explicitly includes Affiliates in the definition of ""Indemnified Party""**, providing clear protection for them under the indemnity provisions, while excluding claims *by* Affiliates from the scope of indemnifiable claims.",5
Indemnified party includes affiliates,1618943a84,"Notwithstanding the foregoing, no rights, obligations or liabilities hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without prior written consent of all of the other Parties; provided, however, that a Party shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to the assignment of rights and obligations by the other Parties to its Affiliate if that Affiliate's performance has been guaranteed satisfactorily in form and substance by the assigning Party.","The query asks whether the **""indemnified party"" includes affiliates**, and the provided clause addresses the **assignment of rights and obligations to affiliates** under certain conditions. Here’s the relevance:

1. **Affiliates and Assignment Rights**:  
   The clause explicitly permits a party to assign its rights and obligations to an **affiliate**, provided:  
   - The other parties consent (which cannot be unreasonably withheld).  
   - The assigning party guarantees the affiliate’s performance in a satisfactory manner.  

   This implies that affiliates can indeed become **parties to the contract** (and thus potentially qualify as ""indemnified parties"") through assignment, assuming the conditions are met.  

2. **Indemnified Party Implications**:  
   If an affiliate assumes rights/obligations via assignment, it would logically be entitled to the same protections as the original party, including indemnification. The clause supports the interpretation that affiliates may be covered as indemnified parties **if they step into the shoes of a contracting party** through proper assignment.  

3. **Connection to External Context**:  
   The external excerpts emphasize restrictions on actions without consent (e.g., prohibiting subsidiaries/affiliates from certain acts unless approved). This aligns with the clause’s theme of **controlled permissions**—affiliates are included but subject to safeguards (e.g., guarantees, consent).  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause confirms that affiliates **can be included as indemnified parties** if they validly assume contractual rights/obligations via assignment, provided the assigning party guarantees performance and consent is not unreasonably withheld. This aligns with broader contractual practices where affiliates are often recognized as extensions of the original parties.

Here’s the relevance:

1. **Explicit Inclusion of Affiliates**:  
   The clause states that the **Indemnified Party** (the party receiving indemnification) **""and its Affiliates""** are covered under the indemnity. This means affiliates (and their employees, directors, and representatives) are expressly protected from claims, costs, losses, etc., arising from the specified scenarios (e.g., breaches, IP infringement, or operational issues tied to the Indemnifying Party’s site).  

2. **Scope of Protection**:  
   The indemnity extends to:  
   - Affiliates’ **employees, directors, and representatives**, ensuring broad coverage.  
   - Payment of **awards, costs, and attorneys’ fees** incurred by the Indemnified Party **and its affiliates** due to a claim.  

3. **Link to Other Clauses**:  
   - **Section 8.2 (No Consequential Damages)** carves out an exception for indemnifiable claims, reinforcing that affiliates are covered when third-party judgments are involved.  
   - **Section 8.3 (Limitation of Damages)** also preserves indemnity obligations, implying affiliates’ rights under Section 7.2 remain intact.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause directly addresses the query by defining the **Indemnified Party** to include affiliates, ensuring they are protected under the indemnity provisions. The external references (e.g., specific performance clauses) are less relevant here, as the indemnity language itself is unambiguous.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Definition of ""Claim""**:  
   - The clause defines ""Claim"" broadly to include any third-party claims, actions, or proceedings (excluding claims by affiliates). This sets the scope for indemnification.

2. **Indemnification Obligations (Section 7.2)**:  
   - The **first party (Indemnifying Party)** agrees to **defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the other party (Indemnified Party) and its affiliates against specified claims, including:  
     - Claims related to the operation/content of the Indemnifying Party’s site (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
     - Claims arising from products/services offered through the Indemnifying Party’s site (with exceptions for the Indemnified Party’s products).  
     - Claims for breaches of representations/warranties (Section 7.1) or regulatory compliance (Section 4.4, for the Company).  
     - Claims for intellectual property infringement due to materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  
   - The Indemnifying Party must cover **awards, costs, and attorneys' fees** resulting from such claims, subject to procedural requirements (Section 7.3).

3. **Exclusions and Limitations (Section 8.2)**:  
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for **consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) unless:  
     - The damages are awarded to a third party in a judgment covered by indemnification (Section 7.2).  
     - The damages arise from a breach of confidentiality (Section 11.4).  
   - This reinforces that indemnification is limited to **direct claims** and certain specified exceptions.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause directly addresses **how the first party (Indemnifying Party) must indemnify the other party** for specified third-party claims, including legal costs and damages.  
- It clarifies the **scope of indemnifiable claims** (e.g., site operations, product liability, IP infringement) and **exclusions** (e.g., consequential damages unless indemnifiable).  
- The external information (Sections 8.5 and 10.12 from other agreements) underscores the enforceability of indemnification through equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions), but the provided clause focuses on **monetary indemnification** for specific claims.  

### Practical Implications:
- A party seeking indemnification must ensure the claim falls under the defined categories (e.g., site content, product liability).  
- The indemnifying party’s liability is broad for direct claims but excludes indirect losses unless explicitly carved out (e.g., third-party judgments).  

In summary, this clause is a **detailed indemnification mechanism** where the first party assumes responsibility for defending and compensating the other party against enumerated third-party claims, with clear boundaries on liability.",5

7.2 Indemnity. Each Party (as applicable, the ""Indemnifying Party"") will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other Party (the ""Indemnified Party"") and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors and representatives) from and against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any Claim, to the extent it is based on (a) the operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's Site (other than any items or materials supplied, or operation or content required, by the Indemnified Party), (b) the offer, marketing or sale of any products or services through the Indemnifying Party's Site (other than any products offered, marketed or sold by the Indemnified Party through such Site, the Parties acknowledging that Company shall be deemed the Indemnifying Party as to any Claim related to any products offered, marketed or sold by Company through the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section and/or Mirror Company Site, except to the extent that such Claim relates to any ACSI Site Functionality or other items or content provided by or for ACSI with respect to the Spoken-Word Audio Sub-Section and/or Mirror Company Site), (c) any actual or alleged breach of the Indemnifying Party's representations or warranties set forth in Section 7.1 [Representations] above, or, in the case of Company, its obligations under Section 4.4 [Regulatory Compliance] above, or (d) any actual or alleged infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights by any content, items or materials provided by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party for its use under this Agreement. Subject to Section 7.3 [Procedure], the Indemnifying Party will pay any award against the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors or representatives) and any costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by them resulting from any such Claim.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **""first party indemnification of specified claims""** because it outlines the indemnification obligations between the parties (the ""Indemnifying Party"" and the ""Indemnified Party"") for specific types of third-party claims. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Definition of ""Claim""**  
   - The clause defines **""Claim""** broadly to include any third-party claim, action, or proceeding (excluding claims by affiliates), particularly those brought by governmental authorities. This sets the scope for what types of disputes trigger indemnification.

### 2. **Indemnification Obligations**  
   - The **Indemnifying Party** (the first party in this context) must:  
     - **Defend** the Indemnified Party against Claims.  
     - **Indemnify and hold harmless** the other party (and its affiliates) from losses arising from such Claims.  
   - This directly addresses the query by specifying **when and how the first party must indemnify the other party**.

### 3. **Specified Claims Covered**  
   The indemnification applies only to Claims based on:  
   - **(a)** The Indemnifying Party’s own site operations or content (unless required by the Indemnified Party).  
   - **(b)** The marketing/sale of products through the Indemnifying Party’s site (with exceptions for the Indemnified Party’s products).  
   - **(c)** Breaches of the Indemnifying Party’s representations/warranties (or, for the Company, regulatory compliance obligations).  
   - **(d)** Intellectual Property infringement by materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  
   - This **limits indemnification to specified scenarios**, ensuring the first party is only liable for certain defined risks.

### 4. **Procedure and Payment**  
   - The Indemnifying Party must **pay awards, costs, and attorneys' fees** resulting from covered Claims (subject to procedural requirements in **Section 7.3**).  
   - This clarifies the **financial responsibility** of the first party in indemnifying the other.

### 5. **Connection to External Context**  
   - The external excerpts (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 10.12**) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not override the indemnification clause.  
   - The indemnity here is a **separate, compensatory mechanism** for third-party Claims, whereas the external clauses focus on **enforcing the agreement itself** between the parties.

### **Conclusion**  
This clause directly answers the query by:  
- Defining the **scope of indemnifiable Claims**.  
- Detailing **when the first party (Indemnifying Party) must indemnify the other**.  
- Specifying **what types of losses are covered** (e.g., legal fees, damages).  
- Linking to procedural rules for enforcement.  

It ensures that the first party bears responsibility for third-party Claims arising from its own actions, content, or breaches, while excluding liability for the other party’s misconduct.",5
first party indemnification of specified claims,a1f2e7f3dd,"12. Indemnification. VS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PPD, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any claim, action or proceeding by a third party (a ""Third Party Claim"") arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The **indemnification clause** you provided is directly relevant to the query about **""first party indemnification of specified claims""** because it outlines the obligations of each party (VS and PPD) to indemnify the other for certain types of claims, along with the procedural mechanisms for handling such claims. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **First-Party Indemnification**  
The clause explicitly defines indemnification obligations for both parties (VS and PPD) as ""first parties"" to the agreement:  
   - **VS indemnifies PPD** for Third Party Claims arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement.  
   - **PPD indemnifies VS** for Third Party Claims arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach.  

   This aligns with the query by specifying which claims trigger indemnification and which party bears responsibility.

### 2. **Specified Claims**  
The clause limits indemnification to **Third Party Claims** (claims brought by non-parties) arising from:  
   - Negligence  
   - Intentional misconduct  
   - Breach of the agreement  

   This answers the ""specified claims"" aspect of the query by clearly defining the scope of indemnifiable claims.

### 3. **Procedural Requirements**  
The clause details how indemnification operates in practice:  
   - **Notice**: The indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party of a claim.  
   - **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party controls the defense/settlement, subject to acting in good faith.  
   - **Cooperation**: The indemnified party must reasonably assist in the defense.  
   - **Exceptions**: The indemnified party may take control if the indemnifying party fails to act or authorizes separate counsel.  

   These provisions ensure clarity on how indemnification is executed, addressing practical concerns raised in the query.

### 4. **Relationship to External Information**  
While the external excerpts discuss **specific performance** (a remedy for breach, not indemnification), they highlight the parties' intent to enforce contractual obligations rigorously. The indemnification clause complements this by allocating liability for third-party claims resulting from breaches or misconduct, ensuring financial protection alongside equitable remedies like injunctions.

### Key Takeaway  
The clause directly addresses the query by:  
- Identifying the **indemnifying parties** (VS and PPD).  
- Defining the **specific claims** covered (Third Party Claims tied to negligence, misconduct, or breach).  
- Establishing **procedural rules** for enforcement (notice, defense control, cooperation).

As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The **""Indemnification"" clause (Section 7)** is directly responsive to the query about **""first party indemnification of specified claims""** because it:  

1. **Defines Indemnified Claims**:  
   - Explicitly outlines the scope of claims for which one party (the *Indemnifying Party*) must defend and indemnify the other (the *Indemnified Party*). These include third-party claims, fines, or sanctions arising from breaches, negligence, infringement, or violations of law (Sections 7.b and 7.c).  

2. **Specifies First-Party Obligations**:  
   - **Seller’s Indemnification (Section 7.b)**: Seller (first party) indemnifies Buyer for claims tied to Seller’s breaches, negligence, product defects, infringement (except where Buyer’s licensed IP is involved), or legal violations.  
   - **Buyer’s Indemnification (Section 7.c)**: Buyer (first party) indemnifies Seller for claims tied to Buyer’s breaches, negligence, misuse of licensed IP, or legal violations.  

3. **Details Indemnification Mechanics**:  
   - **Conditions for Indemnification (Section 7.d)**: The Indemnified Party must promptly notify and cooperate with the Indemnifying Party.  
   - **Control of Defense (Section 7.e)**: The Indemnifying Party directs the defense and settlement of claims, subject to good faith requirements.  
   - **Settlement Options (Section 7.f)**: Specific remedies for IP infringement claims (e.g., licensing, product modification).  

4. **Conflict Resolution (Section 7.g)**:  
   - Addresses disputes over indemnification liability and allocates costs if parties cannot jointly defend a claim.  

### Relevance to Query:  
The clause comprehensively addresses how a **first party (Seller or Buyer)** must indemnify the other for **specified claims** (e.g., third-party lawsuits, IP infringement, regulatory penalties) and the procedural steps (notice, defense control, settlement). The external references (e.g., *M&A provisions on equitable relief*) are less directly relevant here, as this clause focuses on **monetary indemnification** rather than injunctive remedies.  

**Key Takeaway**: The clause operationalizes indemnification by defining covered claims, assigning liability between parties, and setting procedural rules—directly answering the query about first-party indemnification obligations.",5
first party indemnification of specified claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The **indemnification clause** in Section 10 is directly responsive to the query about **""first party indemnification of specified claims""** because it outlines the obligations of each party (the ""indemnifying party"") to protect the other party (the ""indemnified party"") from specified legal and financial risks arising from breaches of the agreement. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - The clause specifies that each party must indemnify the other against **""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses""** tied to claims or actions inconsistent with the **warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements** made in the contract.  
   - This defines the **""specified claims""** (e.g., breaches of contractual promises) triggering indemnification.

2. **First-Party Obligation**:  
   - The clause binds **""each party""** (i.e., both parties are potential ""first parties"" when acting as indemnifiers). This mutual obligation ensures either party can seek indemnification if the other breaches its commitments.

3. **Procedural Protections**:  
   - It grants the non-indemnifying party the right to **withhold payments** (e.g., pending resolution of a claim) in an amount reasonably tied to the claim and associated costs. This mitigates financial risk during disputes.

4. **Connection to External Context**:  
   - While the external excerpts focus on **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions for breaches), the indemnification clause complements these by addressing **monetary compensation** for losses. Together, they create a layered enforcement framework:  
     - **Equitable relief** (from the external clauses) prevents ongoing harm (e.g., via court orders).  
     - **Indemnification** (this clause) compensates for actual damages after a breach occurs.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause explicitly answers how **""first party indemnification""** operates by detailing:  
  - **Who indemnifies**: Either party as the indemnifying party.  
  - **What triggers it**: Claims tied to misrepresentations or breaches.  
  - **How it works**: Financial protection + withholding rights.  
- It works alongside the external clauses (which emphasize **non-monetary remedies**) to provide comprehensive breach coverage.

In summary, this clause is a **critical component** of the contract’s risk allocation framework, ensuring parties are financially protected against specified breaches, while the external clauses address preventive or corrective measures.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Definition of ""Claim"" (Broad-Based Scope)**  
   - The clause defines **""Claim""** broadly to include any third-party claim, action, or proceeding (including governmental actions). This aligns with ""broad-based claims"" by encompassing a wide range of potential liabilities (e.g., IP infringement, regulatory violations, product liability, etc.).  
   - The exclusion of claims by **Affiliates** narrows the scope slightly but maintains a focus on external, third-party risks.

### 2. **Indemnification Obligations (First-Party Responsibility)**  
   - **Section 7.2** explicitly requires the **Indemnifying Party** (first party) to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party (Indemnified Party) against claims arising from:  
     - **Operation/content of the Indemnifying Party’s site** (e.g., user-generated content, functionality).  
     - **Products/services offered through their site** (e.g., liability for defective products).  
     - **Breach of representations/warranties** (e.g., false assurances in the contract).  
     - **IP infringement** (e.g., unauthorized use of third-party materials).  
   - This covers **first-party liability** for the Indemnifying Party’s own actions or content, even if the claim is brought by a third party.

### 3. **Limitations and Exclusions**  
   - **No Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**: The clause carves out exceptions where indemnification **does not apply** to indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) unless awarded to a third party in a judgment or arising from a breach of confidentiality.  
   - This balances broad indemnification with protections against excessive liability for speculative losses.

### 4. **Procedural Safeguards**  
   - The reference to **Section 7.3 (Procedure)** implies requirements like prompt notice of claims or cooperation in defense, which are typical in indemnification clauses to prevent abuse.  

### 5. **Alignment with External Context**  
   - The external information (e.g., **specific performance** and **equitable relief** clauses) underscores that indemnification is part of a broader enforcement framework. While the provided clause focuses on monetary remedies, the external context highlights that parties may also seek injunctions for breaches (e.g., failure to indemnify).

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The clause **broadly indemnifies third-party claims** tied to the first party’s (Indemnifying Party’s) operations, content, or breaches.  
- It **excludes certain damages** (e.g., consequential) unless tied to a third-party judgment.  
- The **first party’s liability is explicit** but bounded by contractual limitations.  

This structure is typical in commercial agreements to allocate risk while preventing open-ended liability. For ""broad-based claims,"" the clause ensures the Indemnifying Party covers third-party risks stemming from its own actions, but not all conceivable losses.",5
first party indemnification of broad-based claims,596576fcc8,"Section 5.04 Limitations. The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under this Agreement shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall […***…] for such claims until the […***…] of the […***…] shall […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the […***…] of the [… ***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], and (ii) the Indemnifying Party's […***…] for [… ***…] shall not […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…]. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 5.04, the limitations provided in this Section 5.04 shall not apply to (i) any claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (ii) any claim for breach of any agreement or covenant contained herein.","The **""Limitations"" clause (Section 5.04)** is highly relevant to the query about **""first-party indemnification of broad-based claims""** because it defines the scope and boundaries of the indemnifying party's liability for claims under the agreement, including broad-based claims. Here’s how it connects:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Limitations on Indemnification Liability**  
   - The clause imposes **financial caps or thresholds** (e.g., deductibles, baskets, or ceilings) on the indemnifying party’s liability for claims. This directly addresses how broad-based claims (e.g., widespread or aggregate claims) are treated.  
   - For example, it may specify that the indemnifying party is only liable once claims exceed a certain aggregate threshold (e.g., ""until the [...] of the [...] shall [...] of the [...] by the [...] of all of the [...] and [...] of [...]""), limiting exposure to broad-based claims.

2. **Exceptions to Limitations**  
   - The clause carves out exceptions where limitations **do not apply**, such as for:  
     - **Fraud or intentional misrepresentation** (intentional wrongdoing).  
     - **Breach of specific covenants or agreements** (material breaches).  
   - This ensures that broad-based claims tied to egregious conduct or core contractual breaches remain fully indemnifiable, even if other claims are capped.

3. **Alignment with External Context**  
   - The external information highlights the parties’ emphasis on **enforceability of remedies** (e.g., injunctive relief for breaches). The limitations clause complements this by clarifying when monetary indemnification is restricted, preserving other remedies (like equitable relief) for excluded claims.  
   - For example, if broad-based claims arise from fraud, the indemnifying party cannot rely on the liability cap, aligning with the agreement’s broader enforcement framework.

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause balances risk between parties by limiting exposure to broad-based claims (e.g., minor or aggregate losses) while preserving full liability for severe misconduct.  
- **Certainty**: It provides predictability for the indemnifying party by capping potential liability, which is critical in transactions with widespread potential claims.  

In summary, **Section 5.04** directly governs how broad-based indemnification claims are handled—imposing financial safeguards while ensuring accountability for material breaches or bad-faith actions. This aligns with the query’s focus on indemnification scope and limitations.",5

As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The **indemnification clause** in the agreement is highly relevant to the query about **""first party indemnification of broad-based claims""** because it outlines the scope, process, and conditions under which one party (the **Indemnifying Party**) must defend and indemnify the other party (the **Indemnified Party**) against third-party claims. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification (Broad-Based Claims)**  
The clause covers a **wide range of claims**, including:  
- **Third-party claims** for personal injury, property damage, or other losses caused by breaches, negligence, or misconduct (Sections 7.b and 7.c).  
- **Infringement claims** (e.g., IP violations) (Sections 7.b(3) and 7.c(3)).  
- **Regulatory fines/penalties** imposed due to violations of law (Sections 7.b(4) and 7.c(4)).  
- **Other agreed-upon liabilities** under purchase schedules (Sections 7.b(5) and 7.c(5)).  

This **broad coverage** ensures that indemnification applies to **diverse legal risks**, aligning with the query’s focus on ""broad-based claims.""

### **2. First-Party Obligations (Indemnifying Party’s Duties)**  
The clause imposes **specific obligations** on the **Indemnifying Party**, including:  
- **Defending** the Indemnified Party against claims (Section 7.a).  
- **Covering costs** (legal fees, settlements, judgments, etc.) (Section 7.a(1)-(2)).  
- **Controlling the defense** (including settlement decisions) (Section 7.e).  
- **Providing remedies for IP infringement** (e.g., licensing, product modification) (Section 7.f).  

This ensures that the **first party (Indemnifying Party)** takes **active responsibility** for covered claims.

### **3. Conditions for Indemnification**  
The Indemnified Party must:  
- **Promptly notify** the Indemnifying Party of claims (Section 7.d(1)).  
- **Cooperate** in the defense (Section 7.d(2)).  

Failure to comply could **limit indemnification rights**, reinforcing structured enforcement.

### **4. Dispute Resolution & Conflict Handling**  
If parties disagree on liability (e.g., whether a claim is indemnifiable), they must:  
- Attempt **good-faith resolution** (Section 7.g).  
- Potentially enter a **joint defense agreement** or pursue **separate legal action** (with reimbursement rights).  

This ensures **clarity in enforcement**, even for complex or disputed claims.

### **Relevance to External Information**  
The external clauses (e.g., **irreparable harm, equitable relief**) complement indemnification by:  
- Reinforcing that **monetary damages may not suffice** for breaches (supporting injunctive relief).  
- Confirming that **specific performance** (e.g., enforcing indemnification) is a key remedy.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause **directly addresses broad-based claims** by:  
1. Defining **wide-ranging indemnifiable claims**.  
2. Assigning **clear first-party obligations** (defense, cost coverage).  
3. Setting **conditions for enforcement**.  
4. Providing **mechanisms for disputes**.  

Thus, it ensures that the **Indemnifying Party** bears responsibility for **diverse third-party claims**, aligning with the query’s focus on **broad indemnification obligations**.

- It includes **third-party claims** (e.g., customer lawsuits) and **direct claims** (e.g., breach of warranties).  
- The indemnification extends to **legal costs (attorney’s fees) at all litigation stages**, reinforcing its broad scope.  

### **Connection to External Information:**  
While the external excerpts focus on **representations, warranties, and corporate authority** (e.g., Sections 3.3, 3.5, and 8.1), they indirectly support the indemnification clause by:  
- Confirming the **enforceability** of the Company’s obligations (Section 3.3).  
- Highlighting the importance of **accuracy in representations/warranties** (Section 8.1), which ties to indemnifiable breaches under **clause 15(c)**.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause is a **classic example of broad-based indemnification**, as it requires the **first party (Company)** to protect the counterparty (North) against diverse legal risks. The external context reinforces that such obligations are binding, assuming corporate approvals are properly obtained.

### 1. **Definition of ""Claim""**  
The clause defines **""Claim""** broadly to include any third-party claim, action, or proceeding (including those by governmental authorities). This ensures that the indemnification obligation covers a wide range of legal disputes, aligning with the ""broad-based"" nature of the query.

### 2. **Indemnification Scope**  
The indemnity provision (Section 7.2) requires the **Indemnifying Party** (the first party) to:  
- **Defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the other party (Indemnified Party) and its affiliates.  
- Cover **costs, losses, damages, judgments, and legal fees** arising from Claims.  

This broad indemnification applies to claims related to:  
- **Operations/content of the Indemnifying Party’s site** (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
- **Product sales/marketing** (with exceptions for the Indemnified Party’s products).  
- **Breach of representations/warranties** (Section 7.1) or regulatory compliance (Section 4.4).  
- **IP infringement** due to materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  

This covers a wide array of potential liabilities, addressing ""broad-based claims.""

### 3. **Procedure for Enforcement**  
The clause references **Section 7.3 (Procedure)**, which likely outlines how indemnification claims are processed, ensuring enforceability. Additionally, the **external information** (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) highlights that:  
- Parties can seek **equitable relief (e.g., injunctions)** for breaches, reinforcing indemnification rights.  
- Remedies are **cumulative**, meaning indemnification doesn’t preclude other legal actions.  

### 4. **Exclusions and Limitations**  
While broad, the indemnity has carve-outs (e.g., claims caused by the Indemnified Party’s actions). This balances breadth with fairness.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause directly addresses **first-party indemnification** by:  
- Defining Claims broadly.  
- Imposing wide-ranging indemnity obligations.  
- Referencing enforcement mechanisms.  
- Aligning with external provisions on remedies.  

It ensures the Indemnifying Party bears liability for third-party claims tied to its operations, content, or breaches—key for mitigating risks from broad-based disputes.

WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES""** is highly relevant to the query regarding **""indemnification of broad-based third-party claims""** because it explicitly outlines the indemnification obligations of both parties (Application Provider and Excite@Home) for third-party claims arising from various scenarios. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause broadly covers indemnification for:  
- **Breach of warranties/representations/covenants** (e.g., Section 19(iii)(1)).  
- **Intellectual property (IP), publicity, or privacy rights claims** (e.g., Sections 19(iii)(2)-(3)).  
- **Claims arising from services or content provided by either party** (e.g., e-centives Content vs. Excite Content).  

This aligns with ""broad-based third-party claims"" as it encompasses contractual breaches, IP disputes, and other liabilities stemming from services or materials provided under the agreement.

### **2. Conditions for Indemnification**  
The clause imposes procedural requirements for indemnification, such as:  
- **Prompt notice** of claims (Sections 19(iv)).  
- **Cooperation in defense/settlement** (with limitations on prejudicial settlements).  
- **Right to independent legal counsel** (at the indemnified party’s expense).  

These conditions ensure that indemnification is structured and fair, addressing potential disputes over third-party claims.

### **3. Mutual and Symmetrical Obligations**  
Both parties (Application Provider and Excite@Home) have reciprocal indemnification duties, creating a balanced framework for handling third-party claims. This symmetry is typical in agreements where both parties contribute content/services that could trigger liability.

### **4. Exclusions and Limitations**  
The clause carves out exceptions (e.g., claims based on unmodified materials provided by the other party) and disclaims implied warranties (Section 19(c)), narrowing the scope of indemnifiable claims. This clarifies what constitutes a ""broad-based"" claim versus excluded scenarios.

### **Relevance to External Context**  
While the external references (e.g., specific performance in *maud_102*) are not directly tied to indemnification, they highlight the broader legal principles of enforcing contractual terms—similar to how indemnification clauses are enforced to remedy third-party claims.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause directly addresses the query by:  
- Defining the **types of third-party claims** covered.  
- Setting **procedural rules** for indemnification.  
- Ensuring **mutual protection** for both parties.  
- Excluding certain liabilities to **limit overbroad claims**.  

It is a robust example of how contracts allocate risk for third-party claims through indemnification.",5

iii) Application Provider will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Excite@Home, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents from any and all third party claims, liability, damages and/or costs (including, but not limited to, attorneys fees) arising from:
(1) Its breach of any warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; or
(2) Any claim (including, without limitation, claims for infringement of third party intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights) arising from the e-centives Content, including, without limitation, e-centives' trademarks, but excluding claims based upon the Excite Content or any other materials provided by Excite in the form originally provided by Excite; or
(3) Any claims (including, without limitation, claims for infringement of third party intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights), by third parties arising out of or based upon e-centives' services and/or any other service provided by e-centives, but excluding claims based upon the Excite Content or any other information or materials provided by Excite in the form originally provided by Excite.

20. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Except as provided by Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2) and (b)(iii)(3):
a) Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
b) Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party.","The clause provided (Sections 19 and 20 of the agreement) is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of broad-based third-party claims""** for the following reasons:

### **1. Scope of Indemnification (Section 19)**
The clause explicitly addresses indemnification for **third-party claims** arising from:
   - **Breach of warranties/representations**: Application Provider indemnifies Excite@Home for claims resulting from its breach of the agreement (Section 19(a)(iii)(1)).
   - **Intellectual property (IP) or privacy claims**: Broad coverage for third-party claims related to e-centives' content, trademarks, or services, excluding Excite-provided materials (Sections 19(a)(iii)(2) and (3)). This includes:
     - Infringement of third-party IP, publicity, or privacy rights.
     - Claims tied to e-centives' services or content.

This aligns with ""broad-based"" indemnification because it covers a wide range of third-party claims (legal, IP, privacy) and extends to affiliates, officers, and agents of Excite@Home.

### **2. Broad vs. Narrow Coverage**
The indemnification is **broad** in scope because:
   - It covers **""any and all""** third-party claims, including attorneys' fees.
   - It applies to claims arising from **content, services, or breaches**, not just specific liabilities.
   - Exclusions are narrowly defined (e.g., claims based on Excite's unmodified content).

### **3. Limitation of Liability (Section 20)**
While Section 19 provides broad indemnification, Section 20 limits **general liability** but **carves out exceptions** for the indemnified third-party claims under Sections 19(a)(iii)(2) and (3). This means:
   - **Direct damages** are covered, but not incidental/consequential damages (unless tied to the indemnified claims).
   - The indemnification obligations **survive** these limitations, ensuring third-party claims are still fully addressed.

### **4. Connection to External Information**
The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, but the query focuses on **indemnification for third-party claims**. The provided clause fills this gap by:
   - Detailing **specific indemnifiable claims** (unlike the external info, which is procedural).
   - Clarifying that indemnification survives liability caps, ensuring robust protection for third-party claims.

### **Conclusion**
This clause directly answers the query by:
- Defining **what third-party claims** are indemnified (IP, privacy, breaches).
- Ensuring **broad coverage** (""any and all claims"") while excluding narrow exceptions.
- **Prioritizing indemnification** over general liability limits for these claims.

It is a strong example of a contractual provision addressing **broad-based third-party indemnification**.",5

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 8.2 [No Consequential Damages] IS INTENDED TO LIMIT ANY RIGHT OF ACSI TO RECEIVE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.5.2 [Effect of Termination].","The clause provided is highly relevant to the query regarding **""indemnification of broad-based third-party claims""** for the following reasons:

### **1. Definition of ""Claim""**  
The clause explicitly defines **""Claim""** as any claim, action, or proceeding brought by a **third party (excluding affiliates of the parties)**, including governmental authorities. This broad definition ensures that indemnification covers a wide range of third-party disputes, aligning with the query's focus on **broad-based third-party claims**.

### **2. Scope of Indemnification (Section 7.2)**  
The indemnity provision obligates the **Indemnifying Party** to:  
- **Defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the Indemnified Party (and its affiliates, employees, directors, etc.) against:  
  - Claims related to the **operation/content of the Indemnifying Party’s site** (unless caused by the Indemnified Party).  
  - Claims arising from **product sales/marketing** on the Indemnifying Party’s site (with exceptions for the Indemnified Party’s products).  
  - Claims for **breach of representations/warranties** or regulatory compliance obligations.  
  - Claims for **intellectual property infringement** due to materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.  

This ensures coverage for **diverse third-party claims**, including regulatory, IP, and operational liabilities.

### **3. Broad Coverage of Damages**  
The indemnification extends to:  
- **Legal costs, awards, and attorneys’ fees** resulting from third-party claims.  
- **Judgments** against the Indemnified Party.  
This reinforces the clause’s applicability to **broad-based third-party claims**, as it covers both liability and defense costs.

### **4. Exclusion of Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**  
While the agreement generally excludes **indirect/consequential damages**, it **carves out an exception** for:  
- **Third-party claims** where indemnification applies (e.g., judgments covered under Section 7.2).  
- **Breaches of confidentiality (Section 11.4).**  
This ensures that **indemnifiable third-party claims** are not limited by the consequential damages waiver, preserving the broad scope of protection.

### **5. Relevance to External Information**  
The external clauses (e.g., **specific performance, injunctive relief**) highlight the parties’ intent to enforce contractual obligations strictly. While not directly tied to indemnification, they underscore the agreement’s **robust dispute-resolution framework**, which complements the indemnity provisions by ensuring remedies are available for breaches (including failures to indemnify).

### **Conclusion**  
The clause directly addresses **indemnification for broad-based third-party claims** by:  
- Defining ""Claim"" expansively.  
- Covering a wide array of liabilities (IP, regulatory, operational).  
- Including defense costs and judgments.  
- Preserving indemnification rights despite limitations on consequential damages.  

This structure ensures comprehensive protection against third-party disputes, making it highly relevant to the query.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Indemnification Scope for Third-Party Claims (Section 19(iii))**  
The clause explicitly requires the **Application Provider** to indemnify Excite@Home and its affiliates against **broad categories of third-party claims**, including:  
- **Breach of warranties/representations**: Claims arising from the Application Provider’s failure to comply with its contractual promises (Section 19(iii)(1)).  
- **Intellectual property (IP) or privacy claims**: Claims related to the Application Provider’s content (e.g., trademarks) or services, excluding claims tied to Excite’s own materials (Sections 19(iii)(2) and (3)).  

This covers **broad-based third-party claims** (e.g., IP infringement, privacy violations) and specifies exclusions (e.g., claims based on Excite’s content).  

### **2. Limitations on Liability (Section 20)**  
While Section 19 provides broad indemnification, Section 20 limits liability **except for the indemnified claims under Sections 19(a)(iii)(2) and (3)**. Key points:  
- **Direct damages only**: Liability is generally restricted to direct damages (not consequential or incidental damages).  
- **Exceptions**: The carve-out for indemnified claims (e.g., third-party IP claims) means the indemnification obligations **survive** these limitations, ensuring coverage for the specified third-party claims.  

### **3. Connection to External Information**  
The external clauses (e.g., *Maud 102* and *Maud 417*) discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, but the provided clause focuses on **monetary indemnification** for third-party claims. However, both contexts emphasize:  
- **Specific enforcement**: The indemnification clause is a key remedy for third-party claims, akin to how equitable relief is prioritized for breaches in the external examples.  
- **Survival of critical obligations**: Just as the external clauses preserve rights to equitable relief, the indemnification obligations here are preserved despite general liability limitations.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause directly addresses the query by:  
1. Defining **broad indemnification** for third-party claims (IP, privacy, breach of contract).  
2. **Carving out exceptions** to liability limits for these indemnified claims.  
3. Aligning with the broader legal principle (seen in the external examples) that certain remedies (indemnification or equitable relief) are **essential and preserved** even when other liabilities are capped.

Section 10.2 NCM General Indemnification. NCM shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Network Affiliate and its Representatives from and against any and all Costs suffered or incurred in connection with or as a result of, and from and against any and all third party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings actually or allegedly arising out of, based upon, or relating to, (i) any breach by NCM of Article IX, or (ii) NCM's fraud, willful misconduct, or noncompliance with law.
Section 10.3 NCM Infringement Indemnification.
(a) Indemnifications Obligations. NCM shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Network Affiliate and its Representatives from and against any and all Costs suffered or incurred arising from any and all third party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings to the extent actually or allegedly arising out of, based upon, or relating to any infringement by the NCM Property (but excluding any Equipment) of any third party U.S. trademark, copyright, or patent issued as of the Effective Date, arising from Network Affiliate's use of the NCM Property in accordance and compliance with this Agreement.
(b) Additional Remedies. In addition to, but not in limitation of, NCM's obligations under Section 10.3 (a) above, NCM may, at its sole option, in the event that any claim, suit, proceeding, or action is brought or threatened for which NCM may be obligated under Section 10.3 (a) to indemnify Network Affiliate: (i) replace or modify the NCM Property to render it non-infringing; (ii) secure for Network Affiliate the right to use the NCM Property; or (iii) terminate this Agreement under the provisions of Article X. In the event NCM chooses to terminate this Agreement under Article X hereof, NCM shall refund to Network Affiliate the portion (if any) of the total amount of license fees actually paid to NCM by Network Affiliate hereunder during the two-year period immediately preceding the date of the claim for indemnification, depreciated according to a five-year straight line depreciation.
(c) Limitations of Obligations. NCM shall not have any liability to Network Affiliate under this Section 10.3 for any alleged infringement based in any part on: (i) any Service content or Confidential Information supplied by or on behalf of Network Affiliate; (ii) the combined use of the NCM Property with software or hardware products or other technology or materials not provided or owned by NCM; (iii) additions or modifications to the NCM Property not made by NCM; (iv) use or installation of the NCM Property in accordance with designs or specifications not provided by NCM; or (v) use of any legacy or superseded version of NCM Property if such infringement would have been avoided by use of a more recent version of the NCM Property made available to Network Affiliate. The obligations under this Section 10.3 state the entire liability of NCM and are Network Affiliate's sole and exclusive remedies, with respect to intellectual property infringement.
Section 10.4 Defense of Action. A Party offering indemnification or defense under this Article X (each, an ""Indemnitor"") shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of any and all claims, suits, proceedings, and actions for which such Indemnitor is obligated to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend hereunder, but the Party or Representative of a Party receiving such indemnification or defense under this Article X (each, the ""Indemnitee"") shall have the right to participate in such claims, suits, proceedings, and actions at its own cost and expense. An Indemnitor shall have no liability under this Article unless the Indemnitee gives notice of such claim to the Indemnitor promptly after the Indemnitee learns of such claim so as to not prejudice the Indemnitor. Under no circumstance shall either party hereto settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any claim, suit, proceeding, or action that is the subject of indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably.","The **indemnification clause (Article X)** in the provided contract is highly relevant to the query about **""indemnification of broad-based third-party claims""** because it comprehensively addresses the parties' obligations to defend and indemnify each other against third-party claims, including the scope, limitations, and procedural mechanisms for such indemnification. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Scope of Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
   - **Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3** explicitly cover indemnification for third-party claims arising from:  
     - **Breach of contract** (e.g., breach of Article IX).  
     - **Intellectual property infringement** (e.g., trademark, copyright, or patent claims).  
     - **Fraud, willful misconduct, or noncompliance with law**.  
     - **Unauthorized use of property** (e.g., NCM Property or Network Affiliate materials).  
   - The language is broad, covering ""any and all third-party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings"" arising from specified conduct, which aligns with the query’s focus on ""broad-based"" claims.

### 2. **Procedural Safeguards for Indemnification**  
   - **Section 10.4** outlines the process for handling third-party claims:  
     - The **Indemnitor** (party providing indemnification) controls the defense and settlement of claims.  
     - The **Indemnitee** (party receiving indemnification) may participate at its own expense.  
     - **Notice requirements**: The Indemnitee must promptly notify the Indemnitor to avoid prejudicing the defense.  
     - **Settlement restrictions**: Neither party can settle a claim without the other’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).  
   - These provisions ensure structured handling of third-party claims, reducing ambiguity in enforcement.

### 3. **Limitations and Exclusions**  
   - **Section 10.3(c)** carves out exceptions to NCM’s infringement indemnification (e.g., claims arising from modifications by Network Affiliate or combined use with non-NCM technology).  
   - This reflects a balance between broad indemnification and reasonable limitations to prevent abuse or overreach.

### 4. **Connection to External Information**  
   - While the external excerpts focus on **enforcement** and **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions for breaches), the indemnification clause complements these by addressing **monetary remedies** (e.g., covering Costs like attorneys’ fees and damages) for third-party claims.  
   - Together, they form a holistic risk-allocation framework:  
     - **Indemnification** covers financial liabilities from third-party claims.  
     - **Equitable relief** (per the external clauses) addresses breaches where damages are inadequate (e.g., to enforce merger obligations).  

### Key Takeaway  
This indemnification clause is **directly responsive** to the query because it:  
1. Defines **broad coverage** for third-party claims (including IP, breach, and misconduct).  
2. Establishes **procedural rules** for defense and settlement.  
3. Balances **protections with limitations** to avoid overbroad liability.  
4. Works alongside enforcement mechanisms (like injunctions) to mitigate risks from third-party disputes.  

For a contract drafter, this clause serves as a robust template for addressing third-party indemnification in commercial agreements.",5

The provided clauses (Sections 11.6, 11.7, 12.1, and 12.2) are highly relevant to this query for the following reasons:

### **1. Exclusion of Liability Limitations for Fraud/Negligence/Willful Misconduct**  
- **Sections 11.6 and 11.7** explicitly state that the contractual limitations on liability (e.g., exclusion of consequential damages, caps on liability) **do not apply** to claims arising from:  
  - **Fraud**  
  - **Gross negligence**  
  - **Willful misconduct**  
  - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12**  
- This means that if a third party brings a claim against a party (e.g., Ginkgo or BLI) based on fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the default liability restrictions **do not shield** the at-fault party. They can be held fully liable for damages, including consequential or indirect losses.  

### **2. Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
- **Sections 12.1 and 12.2** outline each party’s obligation to indemnify the other (and their affiliates, officers, etc.) against **third-party claims** (Claims) and associated losses (Losses).  
- Specifically, indemnification applies to claims arising from:  
  - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (Sections 12.1(b) and 12.2(b))  
  - Breach of contract or misrepresentation (Sections 12.1(a) and 12.2(a))  
- This means:  
  - If a third party sues Ginkgo due to BLI’s fraud or gross negligence, **BLI must indemnify Ginkgo** (Section 12.1).  
  - Conversely, if a third party sues BLI due to Ginkgo’s fraud or gross negligence, **Ginkgo must indemnify BLI** (Section 12.2).  

### **3. Interaction with Enforcement & Remedies (External Context)**  
The external references (e.g., Sections 10.12 and 8.5) reinforce that:  
- **Equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance)** are available for breaches, including fraud or willful misconduct.  
- **Delaware courts (or federal courts, if applicable)** have exclusive jurisdiction, ensuring enforceability of these indemnity provisions.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clauses **directly address** the query by:  
1. **Exempting fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from liability caps** (Sections 11.6–11.7).  
2. **Requiring full indemnification for third-party claims** arising from such misconduct (Sections 12.1–12.2).  
3. **Ensuring judicial enforceability** (via external jurisdictional clauses).  

Thus, if a third party asserts a claim based on fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, the at-fault party **cannot rely on liability limitations** and **must indemnify the other party** for all resulting losses.",5

12.2 Indemnification by Ginkgo. Ginkgo will indemnify, defend and hold BLI and its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, employees, Permitted Subcontractors and agents (each, an """"BLI Indemnitee"""") harmless from and against any and all Claims and Losses, to the extent caused by or arising as a result of (a) the breach by Ginkgo of this Agreement or material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Ginkgo under this Agreement, (b) the negligence, gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct by a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with this Agreement, (c) [***] and (d) any Claims by Ginkgo's employees, Permitted Subcontractors or agents for worker's compensation or other liability coverage, insurance, benefits, and other employee-related claims, and (e) the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, importation, distribution, sale or other commercialization of Ginkgo Inventions by Ginkgo or its Affiliates, agents, licensees, sublicensees or customers, in each case of clauses (a)-(e) of this Section 12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo) except to the extent BLI has an obligation to indemnify a Ginkgo Indemnitee in connection with such Claims and Losses pursuant to Section 12.1 (Indemnification by BLI).","The clause is highly relevant to the query regarding **third-party claim indemnity for fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct** because it explicitly addresses indemnification obligations and liability exceptions for these specific wrongful acts. Here’s a breakdown of the relevance:

### Key Provisions Addressing the Query:
1. **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims (Articles 12.1 and 12.2)**  
   - Both sections outline indemnification obligations where one party (BLI or Ginkgo) must defend and hold harmless the other party’s affiliates, officers, etc., against **third-party claims** (Claims) arising from:  
     - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (e.g., Section 12.1(b) for BLI; Section 12.2(b) for Ginkgo).  
     - Breach of contract or inaccurate warranties (which may overlap with negligence).  
   - This directly answers the query by establishing that third-party claims tied to these wrongful acts trigger indemnification.

2. **Exclusions from Liability Limits (Sections 11.6 and 11.7)**  
   - The clauses carve out exceptions to liability caps for:  
     - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (Section 11.6(E), 11.7(A)(V)).  
     - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (Section 11.6(F), 11.7(A)(VI)).  
   - This means parties **cannot** limit their liability for these acts, ensuring full exposure to damages (including consequential damages, which are otherwise excluded under Section 11.6).

3. **Specific Remedies for Breach**  
   - The external context (Sections 10.12 and 8.5) reinforces that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are available for breaches, including failures to perform indemnification obligations. This aligns with the clause’s intent to hold parties accountable for misconduct.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- **Third-party claims** arising from fraud/negligence are explicitly covered under indemnification (Articles 12.1–12.2).  
- Liability for such acts is **uncapped** (Sections 11.6–11.7), ensuring the indemnifying party bears full financial responsibility.  
- The clause ensures that wrongful acts like fraud or gross negligence are treated as **material breaches**, overriding general limitations on damages.  

### Practical Implications:
If a third party sues Ginkgo due to BLI’s **fraud or gross negligence**, BLI must indemnify Ginkgo for all losses (including legal fees). Conversely, Ginkgo has the same obligation if its misconduct harms BLI. The liability limits do **not** protect a party found guilty of these acts.  

In summary, the clause directly ties third-party claims for fraud/negligence to indemnification and removes liability protections, addressing the query comprehensively.",5

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ARISING (A) FROM A PARTY'S BREACH OF ARTICLE 10 (CONFIDENTIALITY), (B) [***] (E) FROM A PARTY'S FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR (F) IN CONNECTION WITH A PARTY'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 12 (INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE).

Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Exclusion from Liability Caps** (Section 11.7):  
   - The clause states that the general cap on liability **does not apply** to claims arising from:  
     - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsection V), or  
     - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12** (subsection VI).  
   - This means a party can be held fully liable (without the agreed-upon monetary limits) for damages caused by these actions, including third-party claims indemnified under Article 12.

2. **No Consequential Damages Exception** (Section 11.6):  
   - While the clause broadly excludes liability for consequential damages (e.g., lost profits), it **exempts** damages arising from:  
     - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsection E), or  
     - **Indemnification obligations** (subsection F).  
   - Thus, a party can still claim consequential damages if the other party’s fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct caused the harm.

### Relevance to the Query:
- **Third-Party Claims**: If a third party sues one party (e.g., for fraud or negligence), and the other party is contractually obligated to indemnify the first party (under Article 12), the indemnifying party **cannot rely on liability limits or consequential damage waivers** to avoid full responsibility.  
- **Legal Exposure**: The clause ensures that bad-faith or reckless behavior (fraud/gross negligence) is not shielded by contractual limitations, aligning with common legal principles that prohibit parties from insulating themselves from intentional or egregious wrongdoing.  

### Practical Implications:
- A third-party claim for fraud or negligence would trigger indemnification under Article 12, and the indemnifying party’s liability would be **uncapped** (per Section 11.7) and could include **consequential damages** (per Section 11.6).  
- The external references to **specific performance** (Sections 10.12) reinforce that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) may also apply to enforce obligations, though they do not directly address indemnity for misconduct.  

In summary, the clause ensures that liability for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct—including third-party claims covered by indemnification—remains fully enforceable, overriding otherwise applicable limitations.",5
"third party claim indemnity of fraud, negligence or willful misconduct",3c70adb906,"EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO OBLIGATIONS TO INDEMNIFY A PARTY FOR CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (OR ITS AFFILIATES) PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES OR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, TREBLE, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE OF, OR FAILURE TO PERFORM, ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARE CAUSED BY THE SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS BEING WAIVED HEREBY.","The clause you provided is a **limitation of liability provision** that specifically carves out an exception for **third-party claims involving indemnity**, which directly relates to your query about **third-party claims of fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct**. Here’s the breakdown:

### **Relevance to the Query:**
1. **Third-Party Claims Indemnity Exception**  
   - The clause states that **neither party is liable for consequential, incidental, indirect, or punitive damages** arising from the agreement **except** when indemnifying the other party for **third-party claims**.  
   - This means that if a third party sues one party for **fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct**, the other party may still be required to indemnify (i.e., cover losses) for such claims, even though general liability for other damages is waived.

2. **Exclusion of Liability for Negligence, Strict Liability, or Fault**  
   - The clause explicitly waives liability for damages caused by **negligence, strict liability, or other fault** (which could include **fraud or willful misconduct**, depending on interpretation).  
   - However, the **exception for third-party claims** suggests that if a third party alleges fraud, negligence, or misconduct, the indemnification obligation may still apply, overriding the general waiver.

3. **Interaction with External Clauses (Specific Performance & Equitable Relief)**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 9.10**) emphasize that **specific performance and injunctive relief** are available for breaches, even if monetary damages are inadequate.  
   - If a third-party claim involves fraud or willful misconduct, a court might still enforce **indemnification obligations** (as a form of specific performance) despite the general limitation of liability.

### **Key Takeaway:**  
The clause **limits liability for most damages** but **preserves indemnity obligations for third-party claims**, which could include claims of fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct. This means:  
- A party **cannot avoid indemnifying** the other for third-party claims, even if the underlying allegation involves negligence or misconduct.  
- However, **direct claims between the parties** (not involving third parties) for fraud or negligence **may still be barred** under this clause unless another provision overrides it.

"third party claim indemnity of fraud, negligence or willful misconduct",6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The **query** concerns **third-party claims involving indemnity for fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct**. The **clause (Section 13.4)** is relevant in the following ways:

### 1. **Limitation of Liability for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause explicitly states that neither party is liable for **consequential, indirect, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits) **unless** such damages are awarded to a **third party under a third-party claim**. This means:  
   - If a third party sues one of the contracting parties for fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct and wins **consequential/punitive damages**, the clause allows the sued party to seek indemnification from the other contracting party (if applicable under the agreement).  
   - However, the clause **does not shield a party from direct liability to a third party**—it only limits liability **between the contracting parties themselves** for certain damages.  

### 2. **Exceptions to Liability Limitations**  
The clause carves out two key exceptions:  
   - **Breach of Confidentiality (Section 11):** Liability for confidentiality breaches is **not limited**, meaning a party could still be sued for damages (including consequential/punitive) related to such a breach.  
   - **Applicable Law Override:** If **law prohibits** limiting liability (e.g., for fraud or willful misconduct), the clause **does not apply**, meaning full liability exposure remains.  

### 3. **Interaction with Indemnification Obligations**  
The clause **does not limit indemnification obligations** (e.g., if one party must indemnify the other for third-party claims). Thus:  
   - If a third party successfully sues for fraud/negligence, the indemnifying party may still owe **compensatory damages** (even if punitive/consequential damages are excluded between the contracting parties).  
   - The **external references** (Sections 11.13 & 8.5(c)) reinforce that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) remain available for breaches, but monetary damages may still be limited per this clause.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **shields the parties from certain damages in claims between themselves** but **preserves exposure for third-party claims** (if indemnification applies) and **does not override legal prohibitions on limiting liability for fraud/willful misconduct**. It ensures that while internal disputes have capped damages, third-party risks (like fraud claims) may still trigger indemnification or full liability where law requires.

The provided indemnity clauses (Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10.6) are directly relevant to this query for the following reasons:

### **1. Scope of Indemnity for Third-Party Claims**  
The clauses explicitly address indemnification for third-party claims arising from:  
- **Product infringement** (Section 10.1: patent/copyright/trade secret claims).  
- **Product safety** (Section 10.2: claims due to unsafe use per Accuray’s specifications).  
- **Distributor’s non-compliance** (Section 10.6: claims due to Distributor’s acts/misrepresentations **not in accordance with the Agreement**).  

This aligns with the query’s focus on **limiting indemnity to compliant use**—the indemnity applies only if the product is used as specified (e.g., per Accuray’s written instructions) or if Distributor adheres to the Agreement’s terms.  

### **2. Conditions Triggering Indemnity**  
The clauses impose **strict compliance requirements** for indemnity to apply:  
- **Notice and control**: Distributor must notify Accuray promptly and cede control of the defense (Sections 10.1–10.2).  
- **Adherence to specifications**: Accuray’s indemnity for product safety (Section 10.2) is contingent on use **""according to Accuray’s written Specifications.""**  
- **Distributor’s breach voids protection**: Section 10.6 denies indemnity if Distributor acts outside the Agreement (e.g., misrepresentations or non-compliant acts).  

This reinforces the **limitation** sought in the query: indemnity is tied to **proper use and compliance** with the Agreement.  

### **3. External Context (Enforcement & Remedies)**  
The external excerpts (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) highlight that breaches may lead to **equitable relief (e.g., injunctions)**. While not directly about indemnity, they underscore the Agreement’s emphasis on **enforcing compliance**—supporting the interpretation that indemnity is conditional on adherence to terms.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clauses **explicitly limit indemnity** to scenarios where:  
- Products are used per Accuray’s specifications (Section 10.2).  
- Distributor complies with the Agreement (Section 10.6).  
- Procedural conditions (notice/control) are met (Sections 10.1–10.2).  

Thus, the indemnity framework is **narrowly tailored to third-party claims arising from compliant use**, addressing the query’s core concern.  

**Key Takeaway**: Indemnity is **not unconditional**—it applies only if the Agreement’s terms (including product use guidelines) are followed. Non-compliance (e.g., misuse or breach) voids protection.",5

The provided clause (Section 10) is directly relevant because it outlines the indemnification obligations of both parties (Accuray and Distributor) for third-party claims, with specific conditions tied to compliance with the agreement. Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

### Key Relevance Points:
1. **Third-Party Claim Indemnity Scope**  
   - **Accuray’s Indemnity (Sections 10.1–10.2)**: Accuray agrees to defend and indemnify Distributor against third-party claims for:  
     - **Infringement** (patent, copyright, trade secret) of Products provided under the agreement.  
     - **Product liability** (unsafe use per Accuray’s written Specifications).  
     - *Limitation*: Indemnity applies only if Distributor complies with the agreement’s terms (e.g., prompt notice, ceding control of defense to Accuray).  

   - **Distributor’s Indemnity (Section 10.6)**: Distributor must indemnify Accuray for third-party claims arising from:  
     - **Non-compliance** (Distributor’s acts/omissions violating the agreement).  
     - **Misrepresentations** about Products/Services.  

2. **Compliance as a Condition for Indemnity**  
   - Both parties’ indemnity obligations are contingent on the other party adhering to the agreement’s terms. For example:  
     - Distributor must notify Accuray promptly and cooperate (Sections 10.1–10.2).  
     - Accuray’s indemnity is void if Distributor settles claims without consent.  
   - Non-compliant use (e.g., misuse of Products outside Specifications) could invalidate indemnity rights.  

3. **Exclusions and Liability Caps**  
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for certain damages (e.g., consequential, punitive) unless tied to:  
     - Unauthorized IP use, willful misconduct, or violations of mandatory law (Section 11.3).  
   - Liability is capped (e.g., to purchase prices paid in the prior 12 months), reinforcing that indemnity is not absolute but tied to contractual compliance.  

### External Context (Enforcement/Jurisdiction):  
The external excerpts (Sections 10.12 and 8.5) highlight that breaches of these indemnity terms could trigger equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions), underscoring the importance of compliance for enforcement.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause directly ties third-party indemnification to **proper use of Products per the agreement’s terms**. Non-compliance (e.g., misuse, failure to notify) limits or voids indemnity rights, aligning with the query’s focus on indemnity being conditional on compliant use.",5
Third Party claim indemnity limited to use of products in compliance with agreement,d14ed4fca2,"10. INDEMNITIES. 10.1. Accuray Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent. 10.2. Products Liability Indemnity.

Here’s the relevance:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Indemnity Scope Linked to Compliance**  
   - **Accuray’s Indemnity (10.1 & 10.2)**: Accuray agrees to indemnify Distributor for third-party claims **only if** the claim arises from:  
     - Infringement of IP rights (patent/copyright/trade secret) by Accuray’s products **as provided under the agreement**.  
     - Product liability claims **when the product is used according to Accuray’s written specifications** (i.e., compliant use).  
   - **Distributor’s Indemnity (10.6)**: Distributor must indemnify Accuray for claims arising from **Distributor’s acts/omissions not in compliance with the agreement** (e.g., misuse of products or misrepresentations).  

2. **Conditions for Indemnification**  
   Indemnity is contingent on:  
   - **Prompt notice** of the claim.  
   - **Control of defense** by the indemnifying party (Accuray or Distributor, as applicable).  
   - **Cooperation** from the indemnified party.  
   This ensures indemnity applies only when the claim is managed per the agreement’s terms.  

3. **Limitation to Agreement Terms**  
   - The indemnity obligations are **explicitly tied to the products/services provided ""under this Agreement""** (10.1, 10.2) or actions **""in accordance with this Agreement""** (10.6).  
   - Non-compliant use (e.g., Distributor’s unauthorized modifications or misuse) shifts liability to Distributor under 10.6.  

### Relevance to Query:  
The clause **limits third-party claim indemnity to scenarios where products are used in compliance with the agreement**:  
- Accuray covers claims arising from **proper use** (per specifications/agreement terms).  
- Distributor bears liability for **non-compliant acts** (breach/misuse).  
This aligns with the query’s focus on indemnity being conditional on adherence to the agreement.  

### External Context (Enforcement):  
The external snippets (Sections 8.5 and 10.12) emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches, reinforcing that indemnity rights are enforceable only if the agreement’s terms (including compliance conditions) are met.  

**Conclusion**: The clause directly ties indemnity for third-party claims to **use of products in compliance with the agreement**, with clear carve-outs for non-compliant actions.",5
Third Party claim indemnity limited to use of products in compliance with agreement,a5221603e5,"ARTICLE 8. INDEMNIFICATION
8.1 Indemnification by the Suppliers Each of the Suppliers shall, with respect to Products supplied by such Supplier, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the relevant Supplier), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the relevant Supplier arising from such claims. The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the relevant Supplier, (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the relevant Supplier, or (iii) the fault of the Company.
8.2 Indemnification by the Company Other than claims for which the Suppliers are obligated to indemnify the Company under Section 8.1, the Company shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Suppliers from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the Company), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product supplied by such Supplier infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the Company arising from such claims. The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the Company, or (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the Company.","The query asks about limiting third-party claim indemnity to the **use of products in compliance with the agreement**. The provided **ARTICLE 8: INDEMNIFICATION** clause is directly relevant because it defines the scope of indemnification obligations between the **Suppliers** and the **Company**, specifically addressing when indemnity applies and when it is excluded based on compliance with agreed terms.  

### **Key Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Indemnity Scope Linked to Compliance**  
   - The indemnity applies only if the **Product** is used as intended under the agreement.  
   - **Exclusions (Section 8.1 & 8.2)** clarify that indemnity does **not** cover claims arising from:  
     - **Modifications** by unauthorized parties (non-compliance with supplier/company specifications).  
     - **Unauthorized combinations or uses** (non-approved integration with other products/methods).  
     - **Fault of the Company** (if the Company misuses the product).  

2. **Compliance as a Condition for Indemnity**  
   - The indemnity is **conditional** on the Product being used **strictly in accordance with the Supplier’s or Company’s approved methods** (as per Sections 8.1(ii) and 8.2(ii)).  
   - If a third-party claim arises due to **non-compliant use** (e.g., unapproved modifications or combinations), the indemnity is **excluded**, shifting liability to the party responsible for the non-compliance.  

3. **Alignment with External Clauses (M&A Context)**  
   - The external references (e.g., **specific performance, injunctive relief**) reinforce that breaches of contractual terms (including non-compliant product use) may trigger legal enforcement.  
   - While not directly about indemnity, these clauses highlight the agreement’s emphasis on **strict adherence to terms**, indirectly supporting the indemnity limitations tied to compliance.  

### **Conclusion:**  
The clause explicitly **limits indemnity to compliant use** of the Products, excluding liability for claims arising from deviations (modifications, unapproved combinations, or misuse). This directly addresses the query by clarifying that third-party indemnity is **conditional on proper, agreement-compliant use**.

Here’s the relevance:

### 1. **Indemnification Scope Linked to Compliance with Agreement**  
   - **Section 8.1** (Supplier indemnity) and **8.2** (Company indemnity) specify that indemnification applies only to third-party claims arising from:  
     - Intellectual Property (IP) infringement or misappropriation by the Product.  
     - Manufacturing defects under product liability theories.  
   - **Exclusions**: Indemnity is **explicitly denied** for claims resulting from:  
     - Unauthorized modifications of the Product (i.e., non-compliance with the agreement).  
     - Unapproved combinations/uses of the Product (i.e., non-compliant use).  
     - Fault of the indemnified party (e.g., the Company’s negligence).  
   - This ties indemnity to **strict compliance** with the agreement’s terms (e.g., approved uses/modifications).

### 2. **Limitation of Liability Reinforces Compliance Focus**  
   - **Section 9.1** caps liability but carves out exceptions for:  
     - Third-party indemnity obligations under Article 8 (highlighting their importance).  
     - Breaches of confidentiality/license grants (other compliance-linked obligations).  
   - The liability cap (12-month revenue tied to Products) further emphasizes that indemnity is **limited to the contractual framework** and compliant use.  

### 3. **Connection to External Context**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) discuss equitable remedies (injunctions) for breaches, underscoring that **non-compliance** (e.g., unauthorized Product use) could trigger enforcement actions beyond indemnity.  
   - This aligns with Article 8’s exclusions: non-compliant use voids indemnity and may expose the breaching party to other remedies.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause limits third-party indemnity to scenarios where Products are used **strictly per the agreement’s terms**. Non-compliant use (e.g., unapproved modifications/combinations) shifts liability away from the indemnifying party, reinforcing the query’s focus on compliance as a condition for indemnity protection. The liability cap (Article 9) further narrows the financial exposure to compliant transactions.

indemnification that covers violation of law,3aed540ab1,"(a) Indemnification. Each Party (""Indemnifying Party"") shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the other Party (""Indemnified Party"") and its officers, directors, agents, employees, and affiliates, from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, costs, expenses, liabilities, judgments, causes of action, proceedings, suits, losses and damages of any nature, which are threatened or brought against, or are suffered or incurred by, the Indemnified Party or any such person to the extent caused directly by acts or omissions of the Indemnifying Party relating to this Agreement, including without limitation (i) any negligent or tortious conduct, (ii) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or conditions of the Indemnifying Party contained in this Agreement, (iii) any violation of applicable laws or regulations, (iv) infringement or violation of any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary interest of any third party, and (v) any breach of any express or implied warranties relating to the Products, including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.","The **indemnification clause** you provided is directly relevant to the query about **""indemnification that covers violation of law""** because it explicitly includes violations of applicable laws or regulations as a basis for indemnification.  

### **Key Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Explicit Coverage of Legal Violations**  
   - Subsection (iii) states that the Indemnifying Party must indemnify the Indemnified Party for **""any violation of applicable laws or regulations.""**  
   - This means if one party's actions (or failures to act) result in a breach of law, the other party can seek indemnification for resulting losses, legal costs, or damages.  

2. **Broad Scope of Indemnifiable Claims**  
   - The clause covers **""any and all claims, demands, actions, costs, expenses, liabilities, judgments, causes of action, proceedings, suits, losses and damages of any nature""** arising from such violations.  
   - This ensures that legal penalties, regulatory fines, and third-party lawsuits due to non-compliance are indemnifiable.  

3. **Connection to External References (Equitable Remedies)**  
   - The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5(c)* and *Section 10.12*) discuss **irreparable harm** and **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches.  
   - While those sections focus on **enforcement mechanisms**, your indemnification clause **complements them** by ensuring financial compensation for losses caused by legal violations.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This indemnification clause **explicitly covers violations of law** and ensures that the Indemnified Party is protected from financial harm resulting from the Indemnifying Party’s non-compliance. It works alongside equitable remedies (like injunctions) by addressing monetary damages rather than just preventing breaches.

indemnification that covers violation of law,748fd40472,"12. Indemnity and Liability
12.1 Each Party (""""Indemnitor"""") will defend, indemnify and hold the other Party (including associated officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and affiliates) (cumulatively, """"Indemnitee"""") harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees), suffered or incurred as a result of or in connection with any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding brought against Indemnitee based upon (a) a claim of a failure to perform, or a breach by Indemnitor of, any obligation, warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; (b) a claim of personal injury or property damage arising out of the fault or negligence of Indemnitor, its representatives, agents, or employees; or (c) a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right held by any third party.","The query asks about **indemnification that covers violation of law**, and the provided clause (Section 12.1) outlines the indemnification obligations between the parties. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Relevance to Violation of Law:
1. **Broad Scope of Indemnification**:  
   The clause requires the Indemnitor to defend and indemnify the Indemnitee against losses arising from:  
   - **Breach of obligations** (subsection (a)), which could include violations of law if the Agreement includes warranties or covenants requiring compliance with applicable laws.  
   - **Negligence or fault** (subsection (b)), which may encompass unlawful acts (e.g., regulatory violations) if they result from negligent or intentional misconduct.  
   - **Infringement of third-party rights** (subsection (c)), which could involve violations of intellectual property laws.  

2. **Gaps in Coverage**:  
   The clause does not **explicitly** mention indemnification for violations of law unrelated to the Agreement’s terms, negligence, or IP infringement. For example:  
   - Criminal acts or regulatory fines might not be covered unless tied to a breach of the Agreement (e.g., if the Agreement mandates legal compliance).  
   - The clause focuses on third-party claims, not direct penalties imposed by authorities.  

3. **Comparison to External Context**:  
   The external excerpts (e.g., *Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction*) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not address indemnification for legal violations. This suggests the clause above is the primary mechanism for allocating liability, though it may need expansion to explicitly cover statutory/regulatory breaches.  

### Suggested Enhancements:  
To ensure coverage for violations of law, the clause could be amended to include:  
   - A standalone subsection (d) explicitly covering losses from **violations of applicable laws or regulations** by the Indemnitor.  
   - Language clarifying whether fines, penalties, or governmental actions are included (e.g., *""including costs arising from regulatory investigations or enforcement actions""*).  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **implicitly** covers some legal violations (if tied to breach, negligence, or IP claims) but may not address standalone statutory breaches. Explicit drafting would strengthen its relevance to the query.",4

Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Relevance to Violation of Law:
1. **Broad Scope of Indemnification**:  
   The clause requires the Indemnitor to defend and indemnify the Indemnitee against losses arising from:  
   - **Breach of contractual obligations** (subsection (a)),  
   - **Tort claims** (subsection (b)), and  
   - **Intellectual property violations** (subsection (c)).  

   While the clause does not explicitly mention ""violation of law,"" breaches of contractual obligations (subsection (a)) or IP rights (subsection (c)) could inherently involve violations of law (e.g., breach of statutory warranties or copyright infringement). However, the clause does not expressly cover **general violations of law unrelated to the agreement** (e.g., regulatory non-compliance or criminal acts).

2. **Gaps in Coverage**:  
   - The clause focuses on **contractual breaches, negligence, and IP claims** but does not explicitly address indemnification for fines, penalties, or liabilities arising from **regulatory or statutory violations** (e.g., antitrust, data privacy, or environmental laws).  
   - For example, if a party violates a law (e.g., GDPR) and causes harm to the other party, this clause might not apply unless the violation also constitutes a breach of the agreement (e.g., a warranty of compliance).  

3. **Comparison to External Context**:  
   The external references (e.g., Sections 10.12 and 8.5) discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not expand indemnification to statutory violations. This suggests the clause is narrower than the query’s focus.  

### Suggested Enhancements:  
To explicitly cover violations of law, the clause could be amended to include:  
   - A standalone category for **""violations of applicable laws or regulations""** in the indemnity triggers (e.g., adding a subsection (d)).  
   - A carve-out for **willful misconduct or illegal acts** if certain liabilities should be excluded.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **partially addresses** the query by covering some legal violations tied to contract breaches or IP infringement but would need expansion to fully encompass indemnification for general legal violations.

indemnification that covers violation of law,eb53e37b8b,"25. Indemnification. The Parties shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other, their heirs, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, expenses, causes of action, suits, claims, and judgments of any kind or character for injury to person or property arising in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT, whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise.","The **indemnification clause** you provided is relevant to the query about **""indemnification that covers violation of law""** in the following ways:

### **1. Broad Scope of Indemnification**  
The clause states that the parties must indemnify each other against:  
> *""any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, expenses, causes of action, suits, claims, and judgments of any kind or character for injury to person or property arising in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT.""*  

- **""Any and all losses""** suggests a broad interpretation, which could include liabilities arising from **violations of law** (e.g., regulatory fines, penalties, or legal judgments).  
- If a party’s actions under the agreement result in a breach of law (e.g., environmental regulations, labor laws, or contractual obligations), the indemnification clause may require them to cover the resulting damages.  

### **2. Covers Negligence and Beyond**  
The clause explicitly states:  
> *""whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise.""*  
- This means indemnification applies not just to **negligent acts** but also to **intentional misconduct or strict liability** (e.g., statutory violations).  
- If a party violates a law (even unintentionally), the other party could seek indemnification for resulting losses.  

### **3. Connection to External References (Specific Performance & Equitable Relief)**  
The external references (Sections 8.5 and 7.11) discuss **specific performance and injunctive relief** for breaches, reinforcing that:  
- Monetary damages alone may not suffice for certain breaches (including legal violations).  
- If a party’s unlawful conduct triggers indemnification, the injured party may also seek **equitable remedies** (e.g., court orders to stop ongoing violations).  

### **Limitations & Considerations**  
- The clause does **not explicitly mention ""violation of law,""** so its applicability depends on interpretation.  
- Some contracts **exclude intentional misconduct or illegal acts** from indemnification—this one does not.  
- If the law itself prohibits indemnification for certain violations (e.g., securities fraud), courts may not enforce it.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause **likely covers violations of law** because:  
1. It applies to **all claims and liabilities** arising from the agreement.  
2. It includes **non-negligent conduct**, suggesting coverage for unlawful acts.  
3. The broader contract context (specific performance clauses) supports enforcement even when legal breaches occur.  

For stronger protection, parties might add explicit language like:  
> *""including, without limitation, liabilities arising from breach of any applicable law, regulation, or statutory duty.""*

### **1. Scope of Indemnification (Section 12.1)**  
The clause broadly covers losses arising from:  
- **Breach of contractual obligations** (subsection a), which could include violations of law if the Agreement incorporates legal compliance as a warranty or covenant.  
- **Negligence or fault** (subsection b), which may extend to violations of law if the negligence involves statutory breaches (e.g., workplace safety laws, environmental regulations).  
- **Third-party IP claims** (subsection c), which often involve allegations of violating intellectual property laws.  

However, the clause **does not explicitly mention indemnification for violations of law** (e.g., regulatory fines, statutory penalties). Unless the Agreement elsewhere ties compliance with laws to a ""warranty, representation, or covenant"" (subsection a), such claims might not be covered.  

### **2. Limitations (Section 12.2)**  
The clause **excludes liability for indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., reputational harm, regulatory fines unless tied to direct claims under Section 12.1). This could limit indemnification for certain legal violations unless they directly cause ""losses, damages, or liabilities"" enumerated in Section 12.1.  

### **3. Connection to External Context**  
The external references highlight:  
- **Equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, suggesting the Agreement prioritizes specific performance over monetary relief.  
- **No explicit carve-out for illegal acts**, but indemnification for law violations would likely require:  
  - A direct link to a breached obligation (e.g., if the Agreement mandates compliance with laws as a covenant).  
  - Proof that the violation caused a third-party claim (e.g., a lawsuit by a regulator).  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The indemnification clause **implicitly** covers violations of law **only if**:  
1. The violation constitutes a breach of a contractual obligation (Section 12.1a), negligence (12.1b), or IP infringement (12.1c).  
2. The claim results in direct losses (not excluded under 12.2).  

For **explicit** coverage of statutory violations, the Agreement would need:  
- A separate indemnity for ""violations of law"" or regulatory fines.  
- A broader definition of ""claims"" to include governmental actions.

seller-favorable indemnification clauses,ab20fdf3c5,"11. Indemnity; limitation of liability. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from and against all claims, demands, actions, penalties, fines, damages, losses, expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs), known or unknown bodily and personal injuries or death or property damage and the consequences thereof, and liabilities of any kind (together, “Claims”) related to any Goods sold to Buyer by Seller or any Services performed by Seller for Buyer, except to the extent such Claims arise out of Buyer’s gross negligence, Buyer’s intentional misconduct, or Buyer’s improper storage or handling of Goods. Seller must defend Buyer in any actions or legal proceedings arising out of Claims with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. This indemnification obligation will survive Seller’s delivery of Goods or furnishing of Services to Buyer. The amount of Seller’s insurance in no way limits Seller’s indemnification obligations. Mutual indemnification on food especially – limitation of liability","The clause provided is a **seller-favorable indemnification clause** because it primarily protects the **Buyer** while imposing broad indemnification obligations on the **Seller**. Here’s how it aligns with the query and why it is seller-favorable:

### **Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:**
1. **Broad Indemnification Scope**  
   - The Seller must indemnify the Buyer against **all claims** (including bodily injury, property damage, legal fees, etc.) arising from Goods or Services, **unless** caused by Buyer’s gross negligence, misconduct, or improper handling.  
   - This shifts most liability to the Seller, even for claims that may not be entirely within the Seller’s control.

2. **Defense Obligation**  
   - The Seller must **defend** the Buyer in legal proceedings, further increasing the Seller’s burden.  
   - The requirement to use **counsel reasonably satisfactory to Buyer** gives the Buyer influence over the legal process.

3. **Survival Clause**  
   - The indemnification obligation **survives delivery**, meaning the Seller remains liable long after the transaction is complete.

4. **No Insurance Limitation**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the **Seller’s insurance does not limit indemnification obligations**, meaning the Seller could be liable beyond policy limits.

5. **Limited Exceptions for Buyer’s Fault**  
   - The only carve-outs are for **Buyer’s gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or improper handling**, which are high thresholds to prove.  
   - This makes it difficult for the Seller to avoid liability unless Buyer’s fault is extreme.

### **Relevance to External Information:**
- The external excerpts discuss **conditions for closing a merger** and **equitable remedies** (like injunctions) for breach of contract. While not directly about indemnification, they highlight how contracts impose **strict obligations** on one party (similar to how this clause burdens the Seller).  
- The indemnification clause goes further by making the Seller **unconditionally liable** unless Buyer’s misconduct is proven, reinforcing its seller-favorable nature.

### **Conclusion:**
This clause is **seller-favorable** because it imposes **extensive, long-lasting indemnification duties** on the Seller with **few escape routes**, while the Buyer enjoys broad protection. If the query seeks to **strengthen** such clauses, additional limitations (e.g., caps on liability, time limits, or narrower claim definitions) could make it more balanced. Conversely, if the goal is to make it **even more seller-favorable**, the exceptions for Buyer’s fault could be narrowed further.

seller-favorable indemnification clauses,53c738132b,"INDEMNIFICATION: Buyer will indemnify and hold Seller, its Affiliates, and Seller’s Agents harmless against any losses, damages, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees), which Seller, its Affiliates, or Seller’s Agents may incur or for which Seller, its Affiliates, or Seller’s Agents may become liable, arising out of the wrongful or negligent acts or omissions of Buyer, of its employees, officers, or directors, or of Buyer’s Agents in connection with any contract of which these General Terms and Conditions are a part.
Seller will indemnify and hold Buyer harmless against any losses, damages, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees), which Buyer may incur or for which Buyer may become liable, arising out of the wrongful or negligent acts or omissions of Seller, of its employees, officers, or directors, or of Seller’s Agents in connection with any contract of which these General Terms and Conditions are a part.
GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these General Terms and Conditions or in any contract of which these General Terms and Conditions are a part, each Party will bear full responsibility, without limit, and in no event will be required to indemnify the other for, any gross negligence or willful misconduct attributable to its managerial or senior supervisory personnel.","The provided indemnification clause is **seller-favorable** in several key ways, aligning with the query's focus on provisions that protect the seller's interests. Here's how:

### 1. **Asymmetrical Indemnification Scope**  
   - **Buyer’s Obligation**: The buyer must indemnify the seller, its affiliates, and **all of the seller’s agents** (broad scope) for losses arising from the buyer’s negligence or wrongful acts.  
   - **Seller’s Obligation**: The seller only indemnifies the buyer (not its affiliates or agents) for losses tied to the seller’s negligence or wrongful acts (narrower scope).  
   - **Favorability**: The seller’s liability is more limited, while the buyer assumes broader responsibility.

### 2. **Exclusion for Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct**  
   - The clause explicitly states that **neither party** is required to indemnify the other for gross negligence or willful misconduct by their **managerial/senior personnel**.  
   - **Seller Benefit**: This protects the seller from extreme liability risks (e.g., claims alleging reckless behavior by its leadership), while still preserving the buyer’s indemnity obligations for ordinary negligence.  

### 3. **External Context (Specific Performance)**  
   - The external references (e.g., MAUD clauses) highlight remedies like injunctions for breaches, emphasizing enforceability. While not directly tied to indemnification, they underscore the agreement’s focus on **protecting parties from non-performance**.  
   - **Seller Advantage**: If the buyer fails to meet indemnification obligations, the seller could leverage such clauses to compel compliance (e.g., via specific performance).  

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:  
- **Risk Allocation**: The seller’s indemnity exposure is narrower (no coverage for affiliates/agents of the buyer).  
- **High-Bar Exceptions**: Gross negligence/willful misconduct exclusions shield the seller from catastrophic claims.  
- **Enforcement Leverage**: The broader indemnity burden on the buyer, combined with equitable remedies (per external clauses), strengthens the seller’s position.  

**Key Takeaway**: This clause limits the seller’s liability while expanding the buyer’s obligations—a classic seller-favorable structure. The gross negligence carveout further caps the seller’s risk.",5
seller-favorable indemnification clauses,a5221603e5,"ARTICLE 8. INDEMNIFICATION
8.1 Indemnification by the Suppliers Each of the Suppliers shall, with respect to Products supplied by such Supplier, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the relevant Supplier), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the relevant Supplier arising from such claims. The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the relevant Supplier, (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the relevant Supplier, or (iii) the fault of the Company.
8.2 Indemnification by the Company Other than claims for which the Suppliers are obligated to indemnify the Company under Section 8.1, the Company shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Suppliers from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the Company), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product supplied by such Supplier infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the Company arising from such claims. The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the Company, or (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the Company.","The indemnification clauses in **ARTICLE 8** are **seller-favorable** (or **Supplier-favorable**, in this context) in several key ways, aligning with the query's focus on provisions that protect the seller (Supplier) more than the buyer (Company). Here’s how:

### **1. Narrow Scope of Supplier Indemnification (8.1)**  
The Suppliers' indemnification obligations are **limited to specific scenarios**:  
- **IP infringement** or **misappropriation claims** (only for Products they supplied).  
- **Product liability claims** (only for **manufacturing defects**).  

**Exclusions favor Suppliers**: The indemnity **does not cover** claims arising from:  
   - Modifications by the **Company** or third parties (unless done by the Supplier).  
   - Combinations with other products/materials (unless approved by the Supplier).  
   - The **Company’s own fault**.  

This shifts significant liability away from Suppliers and onto the Company or third parties.

### **2. Broad Scope of Company Indemnification (8.2)**  
The Company must indemnify Suppliers for **the same types of claims** (IP infringement, product liability) **unless the Suppliers are already obligated to cover them under 8.1**. This creates a **fallback obligation** for the Company, even in scenarios where the Supplier might share some responsibility.  

### **3. Asymmetry in Control Over Settlements**  
- **Suppliers** have veto power over settlements in claims they indemnify (must be ""approved by the relevant Supplier"").  
- The **Company** similarly controls settlements for its indemnified claims, but the broader scope of its obligations means it bears more risk.  

### **4. No Cap or Time Limit on Indemnification**  
The clause does not specify:  
- A **monetary cap** on indemnification amounts.  
- A **time limit** for bringing claims (e.g., survival period).  

This could disproportionately benefit Suppliers if claims arise long after delivery, as the Company remains exposed indefinitely.  

### **Comparison to External Context**  
The external examples highlight clauses about **specific performance** and **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breach of contract. While not directly about indemnification, they underscore that parties often negotiate **remedies** and **enforcement mechanisms** to protect their interests. Here, the Suppliers’ indemnification terms act as a **risk-shifting tool**, favoring them by:  
- Limiting their exposure to narrowly defined claims.  
- Expanding the Company’s indemnity obligations.  
- Retaining control over dispute resolution (e.g., settlement approval).  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **seller-favorable** because it:  
1. **Minimizes Supplier liability** through narrow triggers and broad exclusions.  
2. **Expands Company liability** as a catch-all for uncovered claims.  
3. **Gives Suppliers leverage** via settlement approval rights.  

For a **buyer-favorable** version, you’d want broader Supplier obligations, fewer exclusions, and caps on liability.",5

Here’s how:

### 1. **Asymmetrical Indemnification Obligations**  
   - **Supplier Protections (Section 8.1)**:  
     - Suppliers are only liable for claims arising from (a) IP infringement/misappropriation or (b) manufacturing defects.  
     - The indemnity is further narrowed by **three carve-outs** (e.g., modifications by the Company, unauthorized combinations, or the Company’s fault), significantly limiting the Suppliers’ exposure.  
   - **Company Obligations (Section 8.2)**:  
     - The Company must indemnify Suppliers for the same types of claims (IP infringement, manufacturing defects) **unless the Suppliers are already obligated to indemnify under Section 8.1**. This creates a broader indemnity burden for the Company.  

### 2. **Limited Liability (Section 9.1)**  
   - **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**: Suppliers are shielded from liability for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) except in narrow cases (breach of confidentiality, license grants, or third-party indemnity obligations).  
   - **Monetary Cap**: Liability is capped at **12 months of payments** related to the Products, further protecting Suppliers from excessive exposure.  
   - **Explicit Bargaining Acknowledgment**: The clause states that these limitations are ""essential"" to the agreement, making it harder for the Company to challenge them later.  

### 3. **Comparison to External Context**  
   While the external examples focus on **enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctive relief for breaches), the provided clause complements seller-favorability by:  
   - **Minimizing Financial Risk**: The indemnity carve-outs and liability caps reduce Suppliers’ potential losses.  
   - **Shifting Burden to Buyer**: The Company bears broader indemnity obligations and accepts restrictions on recoverable damages.  

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:  
- **Risk Allocation**: Suppliers avoid liability for common scenarios (e.g., post-sale modifications by the Company).  
- **Financial Safeguards**: The liability cap and exclusion of consequential damages protect Suppliers’ bottom line.  
- **Asymmetry**: The Company’s indemnity obligations are broader and less conditional than the Suppliers’.  

This structure is typical in agreements where sellers (Suppliers) negotiate to limit their post-transaction exposure while ensuring buyers (the Company) assume more risk. The clause aligns with the query by demonstrating **how indemnification terms can be drafted to favor the seller**.

seller-favorable indemnification clauses,f9b586910b,"10.1 Subject to the Distributor fulfilling all the conditions in this clause 10, the Supplier shall indemnify the Distributor, defend and hold harmless against any liability incurred by the Distributor in respect of damage to property, death or personal injury arising from any fault or defect in the design of the Products and any reasonable costs, claims, demands and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in connection with that liability (Relevant Claim), except to the extent the liability arises as a result of the wilful misconduct of the Distributor. The Supplier shall add the distributor to their current insurance certificate.","The clause you provided is a **seller-favorable indemnification clause** because it primarily protects the **Supplier** (seller) while imposing certain conditions on the **Distributor** (buyer or counterparty). Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Seller-Favorable Elements:
1. **Conditional Indemnification**:  
   - The Supplier’s obligation to indemnify the Distributor is contingent on the Distributor fulfilling all conditions in Clause 10. This shifts the burden to the Distributor to qualify for protection.

2. **Limited Scope of Liability**:  
   - The Supplier only indemnifies for claims arising from **fault or defect in the design of the Products**, excluding liabilities caused by the Distributor’s **wilful misconduct**. This narrows the Supplier’s exposure.

3. **Insurance Requirement**:  
   - The Supplier must add the Distributor to their insurance certificate, which may reduce the Supplier’s direct financial risk by relying on insurance coverage.

4. **No Broad Indemnity**:  
   - The clause does not cover **consequential damages, intellectual property claims, or third-party claims unrelated to product design defects**, which are common in buyer-favorable clauses.

### Relevance to External Information:  
The external excerpts emphasize **enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., injunctive relief, specific performance) and **jurisdiction** (e.g., Delaware courts). While your clause doesn’t address enforcement directly, it complements such provisions by:  
- Defining the **scope of indemnity**, which could be enforced through the remedies described in the external texts (e.g., equitable relief for breaches).  
- Aligning with a seller-favorable framework by limiting remedies to specific scenarios (design defects) and requiring compliance with conditions.

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:  
- The Distributor’s recourse is restricted to design-related claims, and the Supplier retains control over insurance and defense.  
- The clause avoids open-ended liability (e.g., no blanket indemnity for all third-party claims).  

**Contrast with Buyer-Favorable Terms**: A buyer-favorable clause might require the Supplier to indemnify for **all third-party claims**, regardless of fault, or include **uncapped liability**.

Mutual indemnification on food especially – limitation of liability","The provided **indemnification clause** is highly relevant to the query about **""buyer-favorable indemnification clauses""** because it is structured to heavily favor the **Buyer** in several key ways:

### **Buyer-Favorable Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **Broad Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - The Seller must indemnify the Buyer against **all claims, demands, actions, penalties, damages, losses, and expenses** (including legal fees) related to Goods or Services provided by the Seller.  
   - The indemnification covers **""known or unknown""** liabilities, which prevents the Seller from later claiming ignorance of defects or risks.  

2. **Limited Exceptions for Buyer’s Fault**:  
   - The Seller’s indemnity obligation is only excused if the Claim arises from:  
     - **Buyer’s gross negligence**  
     - **Buyer’s intentional misconduct**  
     - **Buyer’s improper storage/handling**  
   - This means the Seller remains liable even for **ordinary negligence** by the Buyer, which is unusually favorable to the Buyer.  

3. **Duty to Defend with Buyer-Approved Counsel**:  
   - The Seller must **defend** the Buyer in any legal proceedings and use **counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer**, giving the Buyer control over legal strategy.  

4. **Survival Beyond Delivery**:  
   - The indemnity obligation **survives delivery** of Goods/Services, meaning the Buyer can still claim indemnification long after the transaction.  

5. **No Insurance Limitation**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that **Seller’s insurance coverage does not limit its indemnity obligations**, ensuring the Buyer can recover beyond policy limits.  

6. **Mutual Indemnification Limitation (Food Exception)**:  
   - The last line suggests that for **food-related liabilities**, there may be a **mutual indemnity** (shared responsibility), but the rest of the clause remains strongly Buyer-favorable.  

### **Comparison with External References:**  
- The **M&A clause (maud_133)** requires strict compliance with representations and warranties, reinforcing Buyer protections.  
- The **specific performance clause (maud_102)** ensures equitable remedies (like injunctions) for breaches, similar to how this indemnity clause ensures Buyer protection via legal and financial recourse.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This indemnification clause is **extremely Buyer-favorable** because it:  
- Imposes **near-absolute liability** on the Seller.  
- Minimizes Buyer’s exposure (only gross negligence/misconduct exempts Seller).  
- Ensures **long-term protection** and **legal control** for the Buyer.  

If you're drafting or negotiating, a Buyer would want to **keep or strengthen** these terms, while a Seller should push for **narrower indemnity scope** (e.g., capping liability, adding ""proportionate fault"" defenses).

### **1. Balanced Indemnification Structure**  
The clause establishes a **mutual indemnification** framework, where both Buyer and Seller agree to indemnify each other for losses arising from their respective wrongful or negligent acts. However, the clause does not inherently favor the Buyer—it is symmetrical in its obligations.  

To make it **buyer-favorable**, modifications could include:  
- **Broader indemnification scope for Seller** (e.g., including strict liability, third-party claims, or intellectual property infringement).  
- **Narrower indemnification scope for Buyer** (e.g., limiting indemnifiable claims to only direct damages or excluding consequential losses).  
- **Higher liability caps or exclusions for Seller** (e.g., uncapped liability for Seller while capping Buyer’s exposure).  

### **2. Exclusion for Gross Negligence & Willful Misconduct**  
The clause explicitly states that **neither party is required to indemnify the other for gross negligence or willful misconduct by managerial/senior personnel**. This is a **neutral provision** (not buyer-favorable), as it applies equally to both sides.  

To make this **buyer-favorable**, the clause could:  
- **Exclude indemnification only for Seller’s gross negligence/willful misconduct** (while keeping Buyer’s liability intact).  
- **Define ""gross negligence"" narrowly for Buyer** (e.g., requiring clear evidence of intent).  

### **3. Comparison with External Clauses (Specific Performance)**  
The external clauses (from MAUD) emphasize **specific performance and injunctive relief** for breaches, which are **remedial tools** rather than indemnification terms. While not directly related, they highlight that:  
- A buyer-favorable indemnification clause could **exclude equitable remedies** for Seller (limiting Seller’s recourse to only monetary damages).  
- Conversely, Buyer could retain broader rights to **seek injunctions or specific performance** against Seller.  

### **Suggested Buyer-Favorable Modifications**  
To make the clause more **buyer-favorable**, consider:  
- **Limiting Seller’s indemnification rights** (e.g., shorter claim periods, higher proof thresholds).  
- **Expanding Buyer’s indemnification rights** (e.g., covering indirect/consequential damages from Seller’s acts).  
- **Asymmetrical liability caps** (e.g., uncapped Seller liability vs. capped Buyer liability).  

### **Conclusion**  
The current clause is **neutral**, not inherently buyer-favorable. To align with the query, it would need adjustments to **shift risk allocation more heavily toward Seller** while **protecting Buyer from excessive liability**.

buyer-favorable indemnification clauses,a5221603e5,"ARTICLE 8. INDEMNIFICATION
8.1 Indemnification by the Suppliers Each of the Suppliers shall, with respect to Products supplied by such Supplier, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the relevant Supplier), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the relevant Supplier arising from such claims. The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the relevant Supplier, (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the relevant Supplier, or (iii) the fault of the Company.
8.2 Indemnification by the Company Other than claims for which the Suppliers are obligated to indemnify the Company under Section 8.1, the Company shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Suppliers from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the Company), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product supplied by such Supplier infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the Company arising from such claims. The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the Company, or (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the Company.","The provided indemnification clause is relevant to the query about **""buyer-favorable indemnification clauses""** in the following ways:

### **1. Broad Protection for the Buyer (Company)**  
- **Supplier Liability**: Under **Section 8.1**, the Suppliers must indemnify the Company (buyer) for:  
  - **IP Infringement Claims** (if a Product infringes third-party IP rights).  
  - **Product Liability Claims** (if a manufacturing defect causes harm).  
  This shifts significant legal and financial risk to the Suppliers.  

- **Limited Exclusions**: The Supplier’s indemnity obligation is only excluded if the claim arises **solely** from:  
  - Unauthorized modifications by the Company (or a third party).  
  - Unapproved combinations with other products.  
  - The Company’s own fault.  
  This means the Supplier remains liable even if the Company contributed to the issue, unless the Company’s actions were the **sole** cause.  

### **2. Narrower Protection for the Supplier**  
- **Company’s Indemnity (Section 8.2)**: The Company only indemnifies Suppliers for claims **not covered under Section 8.1**, meaning:  
  - The Suppliers get protection **only if** the claim is unrelated to IP infringement or manufacturing defects (which are the most common risks).  
  - The exclusions mirror those in Section 8.1, but since the Suppliers’ liability is broader, this creates an imbalance favoring the Company.  

### **3. Buyer-Favorable Features**  
- **Defense Obligation**: The Suppliers must **defend** the Company (not just indemnify), reducing the Company’s legal burden.  
- **Settlement Control**: The Suppliers can only settle claims if they **approve the settlement**, but the Company has similar control over its own indemnity obligations.  
- **No Caps or Time Limits**: The clause does not limit the Suppliers’ liability in amount or duration, which is favorable to the Company.  

### **Comparison to External Clauses**  
The external clauses (from MAUD) discuss **specific performance and injunctive relief**, which are remedies for breach, not indemnification. However, they reinforce the idea that parties may seek **equitable relief** if monetary damages are insufficient—similar to how indemnification ensures the Company is protected from third-party claims.  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause is **buyer-favorable** because:  
✔ The Suppliers bear most liability for IP and product defects.  
✔ The Company’s indemnity obligations are narrower.  
✔ No financial or time limitations weaken the Suppliers’ obligations.  
✔ The Company retains control over settlements and legal defenses.  

If the buyer (Company) wants **even stronger protection**, it could:

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS ARTICLE 9 IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BARGAIN AND ABSENT THIS ARTICLE 9 THE ECONOMIC AND OTHER TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT.","The provided indemnification clause is relevant to the query about **""buyer-favorable indemnification clauses""** in the following ways:

### **1. Broad Indemnification Obligations for Suppliers (Buyer-Favorable)**
   - **Section 8.1** requires **Suppliers** to indemnify the **Company (Buyer)** against third-party claims related to:
     - **IP infringement** (e.g., if a Product violates someone else’s patents/copyrights).
     - **Product liability** (e.g., manufacturing defects causing harm).
   - This is **buyer-favorable** because:
     - The **Supplier bears the burden** of defending and covering costs (including legal fees and settlements).
     - The **exclusions (e.g., modifications by the Buyer)** are reasonable and standard, preventing abuse by the Buyer.

### **2. Narrower Indemnification for the Buyer (Supplier-Favorable)**
   - **Section 8.2** requires the **Company (Buyer)** to indemnify Suppliers **only if the claim does not fall under Section 8.1** (i.e., Supplier’s fault).
   - This is **less favorable to Suppliers** because:
     - The Buyer’s indemnity is **secondary** (only applies if the Supplier isn’t already liable).
     - The Buyer’s indemnity mirrors the Supplier’s obligations but is **narrower in scope**.

### **3. Liability Caps (Balanced but Buyer-Protective)**
   - **Section 9.1** limits liability **except for**:
     - **Indemnity obligations (Article 8)** (meaning indemnification claims are **uncapped**).
     - Breaches of confidentiality/license grants.
   - This is **buyer-favorable** because:
     - The Buyer can still recover **full indemnification** for third-party claims (no cap).
     - However, **other damages (e.g., lost profits, consequential damages)** are excluded or capped at **12 months of payments**, protecting the Buyer from excessive exposure.

### **4. Comparison with External Clauses (Enforcement & Remedies)**
   - The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) emphasize **specific performance** (court-ordered compliance) and **injunctive relief** for breaches.
   - While the indemnification clause here does **not explicitly mention injunctive relief**, the **uncapped indemnity obligations** ensure the Buyer has strong financial recourse if the Supplier fails to defend/indemnify properly.

### **Conclusion: Why This is Buyer-Favorable**
1. **Suppliers bear primary indemnity risk** (IP/product liability).  
2. **Buyer’s indemnity is narrower** (only applies if Supplier isn’t at fault).  
3. **No cap on indemnification claims** (unlike other damages, which are limited).  
4. **Exclusions are fair** (e.g., Buyer’s own modifications exempt Suppliers).  

This structure **shifts more risk to Suppliers**, making it **favorable to the Buyer** while maintaining reasonable protections for both sides.

buyer-favorable indemnification clauses,d14ed4fca2,"10. INDEMNITIES. 10.1. Accuray Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement, infringes any patent issued in the United States, Germany, or in the country in which the Customer requested delivery of the Product or any copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing. Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent. 10.2. Products Liability Indemnity. Accuray will defend or settle any action brought against Distributor and shall indemnify and hold Distributor harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent that it is based upon a third-party claim that a Product, as provided by Accuray to Distributor under this Agreement is unsafe when used according to Accuray's written Specifications for its intended use, and will pay any costs and damages made in settlement or awarded against Distributor in final decision resulting from any such claim, provided that Distributor: (i) gives Accuray prompt notice of any such claim; (ii) gives Accuray sole control of the defense and any related settlement of any such claim; and (iii) gives Accuray, at Accuray's expense, all reasonable information, assistance and authority in connection with the foregoing.

10.6. Distributor Indemnity. Distributor will defend or settle, indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent based upon a third-party claim based on or otherwise attributable to: (i) Distributor's acts or omissions not in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) any misrepresentations made by Distributor with respect to Accuray or the Products or Services.","The provided indemnification clause is **buyer-favorable** (here, the ""buyer"" is the Distributor, and the ""seller"" is Accuray) for several reasons:

### Key Buyer-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Broad Indemnification Scope for the Buyer (Distributor):**  
   - **Sections 10.1 and 10.2** require Accuray (seller) to indemnify the Distributor (buyer) for:  
     - **IP infringement claims** (patents, copyrights, trade secrets) related to the Products.  
     - **Product liability claims** (unsafe use per Accuray’s specifications).  
   - These are high-risk areas where the buyer is protected against third-party claims arising from the seller’s product defects or IP issues.  

2. **Seller’s Obligation to Defend and Settle:**  
   - Accuray must **defend or settle** claims at its own cost, reducing the buyer’s legal burden.  
   - The buyer is only required to cooperate (e.g., provide notice, assistance), which is a minimal obligation compared to the seller’s duties.  

3. **No Binding Settlements Without Seller Consent:**  
   - While the seller controls defense/settlement, the buyer (Distributor) cannot bind the seller to unfavorable settlements without written consent. This prevents the seller from being unfairly exposed to unreasonable settlements.  

4. **Narrow Indemnification for the Seller (Accuray):**  
   - **Section 10.6** limits the Distributor’s indemnity obligations to:  
     - Its own **acts/omissions** (e.g., breaches of the agreement).  
     - **Misrepresentations** about the Products.  
   - This is narrower than the seller’s indemnity obligations, favoring the buyer.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause is **buyer-favorable** because:  
- The buyer (Distributor) gets **strong protections** for third-party claims (IP, product liability) while having **limited liability exposure**.  
- The seller (Accuray) bears most of the risk, including legal costs and settlement obligations.  
- The buyer’s indemnity obligations are narrowly tailored, while the seller’s are broad and cover high-stakes risks.  

### Comparison to External Information:  
The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) discuss **enforcement mechanisms** (injunctions, specific performance) but do not address indemnification. However, they highlight the importance of **remedies for breaches**, which aligns with the indemnity clause’s goal of protecting the buyer from third-party claims.  

### Suggested Improvements for Even Stronger Buyer Protections:  
1. **Cap or Exclusions for Seller’s Indemnity:**  
   - The clause could explicitly state that the seller’s indemnity has **no monetary cap** or time limit.  
2. **Additional Covered Claims:**  
   - Include indemnity for **regulatory violations** or **breach of warranties**.  
3. **Advance Payment for Defense Costs:**  
   - Require the seller to **advance legal fees** (not just reimburse later).  

This clause strongly favors the buyer but could be further strengthened with these additions.

NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS MADE REGARDING SUCH INFORMATION AND MATERIAL, OR ITS COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
11.03 Indirect or Enhanced Damages. In no event will either Party be liable to the other Party under this Agreement for any consequential, indirect, special, incidental, punitive or exemplary loss or damage, including, without limitation, business interruption, cost of capital, loss of anticipated revenues and profits, loss of goodwill or increased operating costs, whether arising from contract, warranty, tort, strict liability or otherwise regardless of whether the possibility of such losses or damages have been made known to the first Party, and each Party hereby expressly waives all such rights and remedies, except for breach of any confidentiality or restricted use provisions of this Agreement and except as provided in Paragraph 11.04 (Exceptions to Limitations of Liability).

(i) Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct attributable to its personnel, and, in no event, will a Party be required to release or indemnify the other Party for Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct attributable to the other Party; and
(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","The clause provided (Sections 11.02, 11.03, and 11.04) is directly relevant to the query about the **""disclaimer of indirect damages""** as it explicitly addresses the limitation of liability for certain types of damages, including indirect or consequential damages. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### 1. **Disclaimer of Indirect Damages (Section 11.03)**  
   - This section explicitly disclaims liability for **indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, or exemplary damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, loss of goodwill).  
   - The clause states that neither party can hold the other liable for such damages, even if the possibility of such damages was foreseeable or known.  
   - This aligns with the query by clearly excluding liability for indirect damages, which is a common contractual risk allocation tool.  

### 2. **General Liability Disclaimer (Section 11.02)**  
   - While not directly about indirect damages, this section reinforces the broader disclaimer of liability for losses arising from the use of provided materials, **except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct** (as clarified in Section 11.04).  
   - It emphasizes that the Receiving Party assumes the risk of reliance on the disclosed information, further limiting the Disclosing Party’s exposure to damages.  

### 3. **Exceptions (Section 11.04)**  
   - The disclaimer of indirect damages is not absolute. The clause carves out exceptions for:  
     - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (e.g., intentional wrongdoing or reckless disregard).  
     - **Third-party claims** (where indemnity or contribution rights under law are preserved).  
   - This ensures the disclaimer does not override statutory or common-law liability for egregious conduct or third-party obligations.  

### Connection to External Information  
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not address disclaimers of damages. By contrast, the provided clause focuses on **limiting monetary liability**, particularly for indirect damages, creating a complementary framework:  
- The external clauses ensure parties can seek injunctive relief for breaches.  
- The provided clause ensures monetary liability is capped, excluding indirect damages unless exceptions apply.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause is a **standard disclaimer of indirect/consequential damages**, protecting both parties from unpredictable financial exposures (e.g., lost profits) while preserving liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or third-party claims. It directly answers the query by outlining the scope and exceptions to such disclaimers.

Here’s how it addresses the issue:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that neither party (nor their affiliates, officers, etc.) will be liable for **special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages** arising under the agreement, regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, etc.).  
   - This shields both parties from liability for losses that are not direct (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or downstream business impacts), even if such damages were foreseeable or the party was warned of the risk.

2. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**:  
   - The exclusion **does not apply** to:  
     - Indemnifiable claims under **Article 10** (Confidentiality) or **Sections 16.1/16.2** (Indemnification of Array/Ono), meaning third-party claims for such damages may still be covered.  
     - Acts involving **gross negligence or willful misconduct**, where liability for indirect damages may still attach.  

3. **Alignment with External Context**:  
   - The external references (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate. However, Section 16.5 **complements** these provisions by clarifying that certain types of monetary damages (indirect/consequential) are categorically excluded unless an exception applies.  
   - This creates a balanced framework: while specific performance or injunctions may be available for breaches, the parties waive claims for indirect damages in most scenarios.

### Relevance to the Query:  
This clause is a **standard risk-allocation tool** to limit exposure to unpredictable or disproportionate liabilities (e.g., business disruptions). It ensures parties are only liable for **direct losses** unless they act with gross negligence or willful misconduct. The exceptions preserve indemnification rights for third-party claims and carve out intentional wrongdoing.

disclaimer of indirect damages,6a700c0c62,"EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","The clause you provided is a **disclaimer of indirect damages**, which directly addresses your query. Here’s how it is relevant:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for:
   - Consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or enhanced damages.
   - Lost profits, lost revenues, or diminution in value.  
   This shields both parties from financial liability for secondary or unintended losses resulting from a breach of the agreement.

2. **Exceptions**:  
   The exclusion does **not** apply to indemnification obligations under **Section 9** for third-party claims. This means that if a third party sues one party, and the other party is obligated to indemnify them under Section 9, indirect damages may still be recoverable in that context.

3. **Broad Applicability**:  
   The disclaimer applies **regardless of**:
   - Whether the damages were foreseeable.  
   - Whether the party was warned about the possibility of such damages.  
   - The legal theory (contract, tort, or otherwise) behind the claim.  
   This makes the exclusion very strong and difficult to circumvent.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **limits liability** by excluding indirect damages, which aligns with the query’s focus on disclaiming such damages.  
- It complements the **external information** provided (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10), which discuss **specific performance** and **equitable remedies** (like injunctions) as alternatives to monetary damages.  
  - While those sections emphasize that monetary damages may be inadequate for breaches, this clause ensures that if monetary damages are sought, they **cannot include indirect or consequential losses** (except for third-party indemnification claims).  

### Practical Effect:
- **Protection for Both Parties**: Prevents excessive liability for hard-to-quantify losses (e.g., lost profits due to a delayed project).  
- **Encourages Contractual Performance**: Since indirect damages are excluded, parties may rely more on **specific performance** (as referenced in the external excerpts) to enforce the agreement.  
- **Legal Certainty**: Courts are less likely to award indirect damages if the contract explicitly disclaims them, unless an exception (like Section 9) applies.  

In summary, this clause is a **strong limitation of liability** that works alongside the equitable remedies mentioned in the external context, ensuring parties are not exposed to unpredictable, indirect losses.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party (LBIO, MD Anderson, or their affiliates) will be liable for:  
     - **Special damages** (e.g., unique losses specific to a party’s circumstances).  
     - **Punitive damages** (intended to punish wrongdoing).  
     - **Incidental damages** (secondary losses arising from a breach).  
     - **Indirect or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, lost opportunities, or loss of use).  
   - This aligns with the query by clearly disclaiming liability for indirect damages, which are often harder to quantify and can disproportionately impact parties.

2. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**:  
   The disclaimer does **not** apply to:  
   - **Indemnification obligations** (e.g., claims covered by indemnity clauses).  
   - **Breaches of confidentiality, non-use, or IP-related obligations** (these are carved out due to their sensitive nature).  
   - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (parties remain liable for intentional or egregious wrongdoing).  

3. **Purpose and Relevance**:  
   - The clause protects both parties from unpredictable or excessive liability for **secondary losses** (e.g., lost profits) that may arise from breaches or other issues under the agreement.  
   - It ensures that liability is limited to **direct damages** (e.g., quantifiable losses) unless one of the exceptions (like gross negligence) applies.  
   - This is a common risk-allocation tool in contracts to prevent disproportionate claims for indirect harm.  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts provided (e.g., Section 8.5 on equitable relief) do not directly address disclaimers of damages, they highlight the agreement’s focus on **enforcing performance** (e.g., injunctions) rather than monetary compensation. The disclaimer clause complements this by clarifying that certain types of monetary damages (indirect/consequential) are excluded, reinforcing the parties’ preference for **specific remedies** (e.g., injunctions) in lieu of uncertain financial liabilities.  

### Summary:  
The clause answers the query by:  
- Explicitly disclaiming liability for **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits).  
- Carving out exceptions for scenarios where such damages may still apply (e.g., gross negligence).  
- Aligning with broader contract principles of risk allocation and remedy limitation.

Here’s how:

### 1. **Disclaimer of Indirect Damages (Section 8.2)**  
   - **Scope of Exclusion**:  
     The clause explicitly disclaims liability for **indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, business, or data) arising from the agreement, **regardless of the legal theory** (contract, tort, negligence, etc.).  
   - **Exceptions**:  
     - Damages awarded to a third party in a judgment where indemnification applies (under **Section 7.2**).  
     - Damages arising from a breach of **Section 11.4 (Nondisclosure)**.
     - **Liquidated damages** under **Section 10.5.2** (explicitly preserved for ACSI).  
   - **Intent**:  
     The parties agree that these types of damages are **unforeseeable or disproportionate to the risk assumed** under the contract, and thus excluded unless falling under the carve-outs.  

### 2. **Limitation of Liability (Section 8.3)**  
   - **Cap on Liability**:  
     Even for direct damages, the parties’ aggregate liability is **capped at a specified amount** ([***]), except for indemnification claims under **Section 7.2**.  
   - **Relevance to Indirect Damages**:  
     This reinforces the disclaimer by ensuring that **total liability** (including direct damages) is strictly limited, further protecting parties from excessive exposure.  

### **Connection to External Context**  
The external clauses (e.g., **specific performance** in Sections 8.5 and 9.11) highlight that **equitable remedies** (like injunctions) are preserved despite the disclaimer of monetary damages for breaches. This shows:  
- The contract prioritizes **non-monetary enforcement** (e.g., performance) over compensation for indirect losses.  
- The disclaimer of indirect damages **does not impair** rights to seek injunctive relief or specific performance.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The clause **broadly excludes liability for consequential/indirect damages** unless exceptions apply (indemnification, confidentiality breaches, or liquidated damages).  
- It works alongside **limitation of liability** and **equitable remedies** to balance risk allocation while ensuring enforceability of core obligations.  
- The language is **boilerplate but critical** for risk management in contracts, particularly in commercial transactions where consequential losses (e.g., lost profits) could be significant.

Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The **""Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages""** clause (Section 14) is directly relevant to the query about **consequential damages waiver** because it explicitly limits the types of damages that can be claimed between the parties. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Waiver of Punitive/Exemplary Damages**:  
   - The clause waives claims for **punitive or exemplary damages**, which are non-compensatory (i.e., not tied to actual losses but intended to punish or deter misconduct).  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention ""consequential damages,"" its focus on waiving non-compensatory damages indirectly supports a broader limitation on damages beyond direct losses.

2. **Adequacy of Remedies**:  
   - The clause emphasizes that the remedies provided in the agreement (and other legal/equitable remedies) are deemed **adequate** for disputes. This aligns with the concept of waiving damages that go beyond compensatory relief (e.g., lost profits or indirect losses, which are often consequential).  

3. **Contextual Link to External Information**:  
   - The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10) highlight the parties’ agreement that monetary damages may be inadequate for breaches, justifying equitable remedies like injunctions.  
   - Similarly, Section 14 reinforces that certain damages (punitive/exemplary) are waived because compensatory remedies are sufficient. This mirrors the logic behind consequential damages waivers, where parties agree to limit liability to foreseeable, direct losses.

### Why This Matters for ""Consequential Damages"":
- While the clause does not name ""consequential damages"" explicitly, its waiver of **non-compensatory damages** reflects a contractual intent to exclude unpredictable or excessive liabilities.  
- Courts often interpret such waivers narrowly, but the clause’s broad language (""any right, power or privilege to claim..."") could be argued to extend to consequential damages if they are deemed non-compensatory or akin to punitive relief.  

### Practical Implications:
- Parties relying on this clause may argue that it bars claims for indirect or speculative damages, though a court would assess the specific language and intent.  
- For full coverage of consequential damages, a more explicit waiver (e.g., ""neither party shall be liable for consequential, incidental, or punitive damages"") would be preferable.  

In summary, this clause is **partially relevant** to the query—it addresses non-compensatory damages (which may overlap with consequential damages) but does not expressly cover all forms of consequential losses.",4

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Provisions Related to Consequential Damages Waiver:
1. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**  
   - This section explicitly states that neither party will be liable for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including lost profits, loss of business, or other economic harm, even if the party was aware of the potential for such damages.  
   - This is a **broad waiver of consequential damages**, which aligns with the query by clearly defining the types of damages that are excluded from liability.  

2. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
   - Reinforces the waiver by stating that neither party can recover **economic losses or damages** under tort theories (e.g., negligence, misrepresentation).  
   - This further limits liability beyond contract claims, ensuring that even if a tort claim is brought, consequential damages are still waived.  

3. **Equitable Relief (Section 9.1)**  
   - While the clause allows for **injunctive relief** (a form of equitable remedy), it does so without contradicting the waiver of monetary damages, including consequential ones.  

4. **Essential Elements (Section 9.7)**  
   - Confirms that the limitations (including the waiver of consequential damages) are **material to the agreement** and were a key consideration for the parties in entering into the contract.  

### Connection to External References:  
The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 10.12*) discuss **irreparable harm and equitable remedies** (like injunctions) but do not waive consequential damages. In contrast, your clause **goes further** by explicitly disclaiming liability for consequential damages, making it a stronger limitation of liability.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
- If someone is asking about a **consequential damages waiver**, this clause is a **strong example** of how such waivers are drafted in contracts.  
- It shows that parties can **exclude consequential damages entirely** while still preserving rights to equitable remedies (like injunctions).  
- The clause also **reinforces the waiver** through multiple sections (9.2, 9.5, 9.7), making it harder for a court to disregard it.  

### Practical Implications:  
- A party seeking to avoid liability for **lost profits, business disruption, or other indirect harms** would rely on this type of clause.  
- Courts generally enforce such waivers if they are **clear and unambiguous**, as this one is.

THIS ARTICLE X SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS WAIVED BY THIS PROVISION, OR ANY OTHER EVENT OR CONDITION, WHETHER ANTICIPATED OR UNANTICIPATED, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER PRE-EXISTING PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT.","The **""Waiver of Certain Damages"" clause (Article X)** is directly relevant to the query about **consequential damages waiver** because it explicitly limits the types of damages for which either party can be held liable under the agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Consequential and Other Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party will be liable for **consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive damages, or loss of profits/revenues** arising from the agreement or its breach.  
   - This is a broad waiver that shields both parties from financial liability for secondary or indirect losses (e.g., lost business opportunities, reputational harm, or downstream financial impacts).

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** to third-party claims. If an unaffiliated third party sues one party for damages (including consequential or punitive damages), the other party must still **indemnify and hold harmless** the first party against such claims.  
   - This ensures that the waiver only applies to disputes between the contracting parties, not to external liabilities.

3. **Scope and Non-Limitation**:  
   - The waiver applies **regardless of negligence, fault, or pre-existing conditions**, making it comprehensive and difficult to circumvent.  
   - However, it does not limit other remedies (e.g., equitable relief like injunctions or specific performance, as referenced in the external information).  

### Connection to the External Information:
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., specific performance) for breaches where monetary damages would be inadequate. The waiver clause complements these provisions by:  
- Clarifying that while monetary damages for certain losses (e.g., consequential damages) are waived, **non-monetary remedies** (like injunctions) remain available.  
- Reinforcing that the parties prioritize **specific performance** over financial compensation for breaches, aligning with the broader agreement’s intent.  

### Practical Relevance:
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause allocates risk by excluding unpredictable or disproportionate liabilities (e.g., lost profits) while preserving core obligations.  
- **Legal Certainty**: It prevents disputes over indirect damages, streamlining enforcement of the agreement’s primary terms.  
- **Alignment with Equitable Relief**: The waiver supports the agreement’s focus on **performance** (via specific performance) rather than monetary recovery for indirect harms.  

In summary, this clause is a **strong consequential damages waiver** that limits liability between the parties but carves out exceptions for third-party claims and preserves equitable remedies. It works in tandem with the broader contract’s enforcement mechanisms.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Explicit Waiver of Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**  
- The clause states that **neither party will be liable** for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including:  
  - Lost profits  
  - Loss of business  
  - Other economic damages  
  - Injury to property  
- This waiver applies **regardless of whether the party was aware of the potential for such damages**, reinforcing a strong limitation on liability.  
- The provision is **independent and severable**, meaning it stands even if other parts of the agreement are unenforceable.  

### **2. Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
- Expands the waiver to **tort claims** (e.g., negligence, misrepresentation, strict liability), barring recovery of **economic losses** unless they involve personal injury or tangible property damage.  
- Even if contractual remedies fail, **no tort-based claims for economic losses are permitted**.  

### **3. Equitable Relief Exception (Section 9.1)**  
- While monetary damages are restricted, **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance)** remain available for breaches (e.g., under Article 13).  
- This aligns with the external references (e.g., MAUD clauses) where equitable relief is preserved despite damage waivers.  

### **4. Liquidated Damages (Section 9.6)**  
- Reinforces that **actual consequential damages (e.g., lost profits) are difficult to quantify**, so a pre-agreed termination fee applies instead.  

### **5. Essential Elements (Section 9.7)**  
- The limitations are **fundamental to the agreement**—Metavante relied on them when signing. This makes the waiver **hard to challenge** in court.  

### **Comparison to External References**  
- Like the MAUD clauses, this agreement:  
  - **Preserves equitable remedies** (injunctions, specific performance) despite waiving monetary damages.  
  - Treats **consequential damages as non-recoverable**, even if other remedies fail.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause **fully addresses the query** by:  
1. **Explicitly excluding consequential damages** (Section 9.2).  
2. **Extending the waiver to tort claims** (Section 9.5).  
3. **Preserving non-monetary remedies** (Section 9.1).  
4. **Emphasizing the waiver’s critical role** in the agreement (Section 9.7).

Here’s how it aligns with your request:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Consequential Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for **indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, business, or data) arising from the agreement, even if advised of their possibility.  
   - This is a classic **waiver of consequential damages**, a common contractual provision to limit exposure to unpredictable or disproportionate losses.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   - The waiver does **not** apply to:  
     - Damages awarded to a third party in a judgment covered by **indemnification obligations** (Section 7.2).  
     - Damages arising from a breach of **confidentiality obligations** (Section 11.4).  
     - **Liquidated damages** (Section 10.5.2), which are expressly preserved.  
   - These carve-outs ensure that certain critical risks (e.g., third-party claims or confidentiality breaches) remain actionable.

3. **Additional Limitation of Liability (Section 8.3)**:  
   - The clause is reinforced by a **cap on aggregate liability** (except for indemnification claims), further limiting financial exposure.  

### Relevance to External Context:  
The external information (Sections 8.5 and 9.11) discusses **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches, emphasizing that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches. However, the **No Consequential Damages** clause operates in tandem with these provisions by:  
- Clarifying that while equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are available, **monetary recovery for consequential harms is barred** unless falling under the exceptions.  
- Preserving the parties’ right to **liquidated damages** (a predetermined remedy) even as consequential damages are waived.  

### Practical Implications:  
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause shifts the risk of indirect losses (e.g., business interruption) away from both parties, promoting predictability in disputes.  
- **Focus on Direct Damages**: Parties can still claim **direct damages** (e.g., costs of replacement or repair) or seek **non-monetary remedies** (e.g., specific performance) for breaches.  

In summary, this clause is a **strong consequential damages waiver** with carefully defined exceptions, working alongside other remedies (like specific performance) to balance enforceability and risk mitigation.

(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","The query relates to an **""incidental damages disclaimer,""** which refers to contractual provisions that limit or exclude liability for certain types of damages, particularly those that are indirect, consequential, or incidental to a breach or other issue. The provided clause (Sections 11.02–11.04) is highly relevant to this query because it explicitly disclaims liability for incidental, indirect, and other non-direct damages. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Incidental Damages Disclaimer (Section 11.03)**  
This section directly addresses the query by stating:  
> *""In no event will either Party be liable to the other Party under this Agreement for any consequential, indirect, special, **incidental**, punitive or exemplary loss or damage...""*  

This is a **broad disclaimer** of liability for **incidental damages** (among others), meaning neither party can claim compensation for losses that are secondary or indirectly caused by a breach (e.g., lost profits, business interruption). The only exceptions are breaches of confidentiality or restricted use provisions (and the carve-outs in Section 11.04).

### **2. General Liability Disclaimer (Section 11.02)**  
This section reinforces the limitation on liability by:  
- Disclaiming responsibility for losses arising from the **use or reliance** on provided materials.  
- Releasing the disclosing party from liability even for **negligence** (unless gross negligence or willful misconduct applies under Section 11.04).  
- Disclaiming **implied warranties** (e.g., fitness for a particular purpose), which could otherwise give rise to incidental damage claims.  

### **3. Exceptions (Section 11.04)**  
While Sections 11.02 and 11.03 disclaim most liabilities, Section 11.04 clarifies that **gross negligence, willful misconduct, and third-party claims** are **not** covered by these limitations. This ensures the disclaimer does not overreach into areas where liability cannot legally be waived.  

### **Connection to External References**  
The external clauses (from MAUD) discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) when monetary damages are inadequate, but they do not conflict with the incidental damages disclaimer here. The provided clause focuses on **limiting monetary liability**, while the external clauses address **non-monetary enforcement mechanisms**.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause is **directly responsive** to the query because it:  
1. Explicitly disclaims liability for **incidental damages** (Section 11.03).  
2. Broadly limits liability for negligence and indirect losses (Section 11.02).  
3. Carves out exceptions where liability remains (Section 11.04).  

This structure is typical in contracts to **manage risk allocation** while preserving remedies for egregious misconduct or third-party claims.",5

THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.","The clause you provided is a **broad disclaimer of liability** that specifically addresses **incidental damages** (among other types of damages) and is highly relevant to your query about an **incidental damages disclaimer**. Here’s how it connects:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Incidental Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the ""Released Parties"" (likely Samsung and its affiliates) **will not be liable** for ""indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive damages, or lost profits.""  
   - This is a clear disclaimer of **incidental damages**, which are secondary losses arising indirectly from a breach or wrongful act (e.g., costs incurred due to delays or disruptions).

2. **Waiver of Rights**:  
   - The participant (or counterparty) **waives all rights** to claim these categories of damages, reinforcing the enforceability of the disclaimer.  
   - This waiver is critical because it preemptively bars legal claims for such damages, even if they were foreseeable.

3. **Limitation of Liability**:  
   - The clause caps the sponsor’s (Samsung’s) liability to the **lesser of actual loss or $1,000**, further limiting exposure beyond the exclusion of incidental/consequential damages.  
   - This reinforces the disclaimer by ensuring that even if incidental damages were somehow argued, recovery would be strictly limited.

4. **Reference to Applicable Law**:  
   - The clause acknowledges that its enforceability is subject to the ""maximum extent permitted by applicable law,"" which is important because some jurisdictions may not enforce overly broad disclaimers (e.g., for gross negligence or intentional misconduct).

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause is a **direct example** of how parties contractually disclaim liability for incidental damages.  
- It aligns with the broader legal principle (seen in the external information) that parties may agree to limit remedies (e.g., to equitable relief or capped monetary damages) while excluding certain types of damages.  
- The external excerpts emphasize **specific performance** and **irreparable harm** as remedies, while your clause focuses on **excluding monetary damages** (like incidental ones). Together, they show how contracts often prioritize certain remedies while disclaiming others.

### Practical Implications:
- This type of clause is common in agreements where one party (e.g., a sponsor like Samsung) seeks to **minimize financial risk** from unpredictable or open-ended damages.  
- Courts generally enforce such disclaimers unless they violate public policy or statutory rights (e.g., consumer protection laws).

### Key Points of Relevance:  
1. **Exclusion of Incidental Damages**  
   - The clause states that neither party (LBIO, MD Anderson, or their affiliates) will be liable for **""incidental"" damages**, among other types.  
   - Incidental damages typically refer to secondary losses that arise indirectly from a breach (e.g., costs incurred due to delays or disruptions).  

2. **Scope of Disclaimed Damages**  
   - The disclaimer covers a broad range of non-direct damages, including:  
     - **Special damages** (losses not arising naturally from the breach but foreseeable under specific circumstances).  
     - **Punitive damages** (intended to punish wrongdoing).  
     - **Indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, lost opportunities).  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on limiting liability for incidental and related damages.  

3. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**  
   - The disclaimer **does not apply** in cases involving:  
     - **Indemnification obligations** (e.g., third-party claims).  
     - **Breaches of confidentiality, IP obligations, or gross negligence/willful misconduct**.  
   - This ensures that the disclaimer does not shield a party from liability for egregious or intentional wrongdoing.  

### Connection to External Information:  
While the external excerpts discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, they do not directly address disclaimers of damages. However, they reinforce the broader contractual principle that parties may limit remedies—here, by excluding incidental damages while preserving other enforcement mechanisms.  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a **standard risk-allocation provision** that shields the parties from liability for **incidental and other indirect damages**, except in specified scenarios (e.g., gross negligence). It directly addresses the query by clarifying when such damages are **disclaimed** and when they remain recoverable.

     - Whether the damages were **foreseeable** (subpart A).  
     - Whether the party was **advised of the possibility** of such damages (subpart B).  
     - The **legal theory** (contract, tort, or otherwise) underlying the claim (subpart C).  

3. **Exceptions**:  
   - The exclusion does **not** apply to indemnification obligations for third-party claims under **Section 9** of the agreement. This preserves liability for direct damages owed to third parties.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause directly addresses your query by **disclaiming liability for incidental damages** in most scenarios, reinforcing that parties cannot recover such damages unless they fall under the carve-out for third-party indemnification.  
- It aligns with the broader legal principle that parties may contractually limit remedies, even if those damages might otherwise be recoverable under common law (e.g., under the UCC or tort doctrines).  

### Connection to External Information:
The external excerpts (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 9.10**) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief** as remedies for breaches, emphasizing that monetary damages may be inadequate in certain cases. However, your clause operates in the opposite direction: it **restricts** monetary damages (including incidental damages) while preserving equitable remedies (like injunctions) unless otherwise limited.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause shifts the risk of incidental losses away from both parties, encouraging them to rely on other remedies (e.g., specific performance) or negotiate alternative protections (e.g., insurance).  
- **Enforceability**: Courts generally uphold such disclaimers if clear and unambiguous, though exceptions may apply (e.g., gross negligence, willful misconduct, or statutory prohibitions).  

In summary, this clause is a **strong incidental damages disclaimer** that limits liability for non-direct losses, with narrow exceptions. It complements the equitable relief provisions in the external materials by clarifying what monetary damages are *not* available.",5
incidental damages disclaimer,5da8e756e1,"9.3. Limitation of Liability. Except in connection with a breach by either party of Article 7 or Section 8.1.5 [REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES] (v) and the indemnification obligations of Impresse under Section 9.4(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY IMPRESSE] and the indemnification obligations of VerticalNet under Section 9.5(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET], neither party will be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages arising out of or related to this Agreement, however caused and under any theory of liability (including negligence), even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.","The **""Limitation of Liability"" clause (Section 9.3)** is directly relevant to the query about an **""incidental damages disclaimer""** because it explicitly disclaims liability for certain types of damages, including **incidental damages**, under most circumstances. Here’s how it relates:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Incidental Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party will be liable for **""incidental damages""** (along with special, indirect, consequential, and exemplary damages) arising from the Agreement, except in specific cases (e.g., breaches of Article 7 or certain indemnification obligations).  
   - This is a clear disclaimer of liability for incidental damages, which are typically unforeseeable or secondary losses resulting from a breach (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm).

2. **Exceptions to the Limitation**:  
   - The disclaimer does **not** apply to:  
     - Breaches of **Article 7** (likely covering fundamental obligations like confidentiality or covenants).  
     - Breaches of **Section 8.1.5** (specific representations/warranties).  
     - Indemnification obligations under **Sections 9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d)** (likely tied to third-party claims or fraud).  
   - These exceptions ensure that core contractual promises or intentional misconduct are not shielded by the limitation.

3. **Broad Scope of Protection**:  
   - The disclaimer applies **regardless of the legal theory** (e.g., negligence, contract) and even if the party was **aware of the risk** of such damages. This strengthens the enforceability of the limitation.

### Connection to External Context:
The external references (Sections 8.5 and 9.10) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches where monetary damages would be inadequate. These sections complement the limitation clause by:  
- Clarifying that certain breaches (e.g., failure to consummate the Agreement) justify **non-monetary remedies** (e.g., injunctions), even if monetary damages are limited.  
- Reinforcing that the limitation of liability does **not** preclude equitable relief for irreparable harm.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:
The clause answers the query by:  
- Explicitly disclaiming liability for **incidental damages** in most scenarios.  
- Balancing the disclaimer with carve-outs for critical breaches and indemnification.  
- Aligning with broader contract principles (e.g., specific performance) to ensure fairness while limiting exposure to unpredictable losses.  

**Conclusion:** This is a robust incidental damages disclaimer, typical in contracts to manage risk, but it preserves remedies for material breaches or indemnified claims.",5
disclaimer of lost profits,b0c7bd078d,"IN NO EVENT SHALL THE RELEASED PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF ANY OR ALL OF THE FOREGOING OR ANY OF THEIR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS MEANS THAT PARTICIPANT HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS FROM SAMSUNG AND ITS LICENSORS. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, SPONSOR’S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO PARTICIPANT ARISING FROM ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF (A) YOUR ACTUAL LOSS; OR (B) $1,000. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.","The clause you provided is a **broad disclaimer of liability** that specifically addresses the query about **disclaiming lost profits** and other types of damages. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### **1. Explicit Waiver of Lost Profits & Other Damages**  
The clause states:  
> *""IN NO EVENT SHALL THE RELEASED PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS...""*  

This means that the **Released Parties** (likely Samsung and its affiliates) **will not be held responsible** for any **lost profits** (i.e., financial gains the participant could have earned but lost due to the agreement or breach) or other indirect/consequential damages, **even if they were warned about the possibility of such damages**.  

### **2. Participant’s Waiver of Rights**  
The clause further reinforces this by stating:  
> *""THIS MEANS THAT PARTICIPANT HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS...""*  

This is a **contractual waiver**, meaning the participant **agrees in advance** not to sue for these types of damages.  

### **3. Limitation of Liability**  
The clause also imposes a **strict cap on liability**:  
> *""SPONSOR’S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO PARTICIPANT... WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF (A) YOUR ACTUAL LOSS; OR (B) $1,000.""*  

This means that even if a claim succeeds, the **maximum recoverable amount** is either the **actual provable loss** or **$1,000** (whichever is lower).  

### **4. Relevance to External Information (Specific Performance Clauses)**  
The external references discuss **specific performance** (equitable remedies like injunctions) rather than monetary damages. However, they highlight that:  
- Monetary damages may **not be adequate** for breaches, justifying equitable relief.  
- The clause you provided **contrasts** with this by **excluding monetary damages for lost profits** and other indirect losses.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **highly relevant** to the query because it:  
✔ **Explicitly disclaims liability for lost profits** (a key concern in contract disputes).  
✔ **Forces the participant to waive claims** for such damages.  
✔ **Limits recoverable damages** to a very low threshold ($1,000 or actual loss).  
✔ **Operates independently** of equitable remedies (like specific performance, which may still apply for other breaches).  

This type of clause is common in contracts to **minimize financial risk** for companies by preventing large claims for speculative or indirect losses (like lost profits).

disclaimer of lost profits,274ec4056a,"DISCLAIMERS 11.1 Disclaimer. Each Party hereby acknowledges that, except to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, including any representation or warranty regarding the validity, enforceability, or scope of the Licensed IP, noninfringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.","The **""Disclaimer"" clause (Section 11.1)** in the provided contract is relevant to the query about **""disclaimer of lost profits""** in the following ways:

1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**:  
   The clause explicitly disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose) unless expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement. This means that neither party is guaranteeing that the Licensed IP (or other subject matter of the agreement) will generate profits or avoid losses. By disclaiming such warranties, the clause indirectly limits claims for **lost profits** that might arise from reliance on unstated assurances.

2. **Limitation of Liability Context**:  
   While this clause does not explicitly mention ""lost profits,"" it sets the groundwork for broader liability limitations. Many contracts pair such disclaimers with a separate **limitation of liability** clause that expressly excludes consequential damages (including lost profits). Here, the disclaimer reinforces that parties cannot claim losses based on expectations not documented in the agreement.

3. **Relevance to External Context**:  
   The external references (e.g., MAUD clauses) highlight strict conditions for representations/warranties and termination. These suggest the agreement is structured to minimize open-ended liabilities. The disclaimer in Section 11.1 aligns with this intent by narrowing the basis for claims, including those for lost profits.

**Key Takeaway**:  
This clause supports a **disclaimer of lost profits** by:  
- Denying unwritten promises that could form the basis of profit-loss claims.  
- Implicitly reinforcing that liability is confined to express terms, excluding speculative damages like lost profits (unless the agreement elsewhere explicitly allows them).  

For a complete analysis, you would need to review the contract’s **limitation of liability** or **consequential damages** clauses, which typically address lost profits directly.",4
disclaimer of lost profits,6f15440528,"Unless any party is in violation of the confidentiality clause, in any case, neither party shall be liable for any indirect, punitive claims, or claims for losses of commercial profits, or damages for business losses of the company or any third Party Arising from this Agreement, or for any loss or inaccuracy of data of any form, whether based on Agreement, tort or any other legal principle, even though the party has been informed of the possibility of such damage","The clause you provided is a **disclaimer of liability for lost profits and other indirect damages**, which directly addresses your query about the **""disclaimer of lost profits.""** Here’s how it is relevant:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Liability for Lost Profits**  
   - The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for:  
     - ""Claims for losses of commercial profits""  
     - ""Damages for business losses of the company or any third party.""  
   - This is a clear disclaimer of lost profits, which are typically categorized as **indirect or consequential damages** in legal agreements.

2. **Broad Scope of Disclaimed Damages**  
   - The clause extends beyond lost profits to exclude other forms of indirect harm, such as:  
     - Punitive claims.  
     - Loss or inaccuracy of data.  
     - Damages arising from tort (e.g., negligence) or any other legal theory.  

3. **Exceptions**  
   - The disclaimer does not apply if a party violates the **confidentiality clause**, suggesting that liability may still arise in cases of breach of confidentiality.  

4. **Intent to Limit Remedies**  
   - The clause reinforces that liability is excluded **even if the party was aware of the potential for such damages** (e.g., ""informed of the possibility of such damage""). This is a common contractual technique to strengthen the enforceability of disclaimers.  

### Connection to the External Information:  
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 7.11) discuss **specific performance and equitable relief** as remedies for breaches, emphasizing that monetary damages may be inadequate in certain cases. However, your clause operates in the opposite direction:  
- It **limits** liability for monetary damages (particularly indirect ones like lost profits), while the external clauses **expand** remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches where money alone wouldn’t suffice.  
- Together, these provisions create a balanced framework:  
  - Lost profits are disclaimed under your clause, but parties retain rights to seek non-monetary remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, as highlighted in the external texts.  

### Practical Relevance:  
This clause is critical for:  
- **Risk Allocation**: Protects parties from unpredictable or disproportionate liability for indirect losses (e.g., lost revenue due to delays).  
- **Commercial Certainty**: Ensures parties are not held liable for speculative or downstream business impacts.  
- **Alignment with Common Law Principles**: Courts often enforce such disclaimers if clearly drafted, though exceptions may apply (e.g., gross negligence or willful misconduct, which your clause does not explicitly carve out).

Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Lost Profits**:  
   - The clause states that neither party shall be liable for **""indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages""**, which explicitly includes **""loss of profits""** and **""business interruption""**.  
   - This is a classic disclaimer of lost profits, shielding the parties from claims arising from such damages unless an exception applies.

2. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**:  
   The disclaimer does **not** apply in the following cases:  
   - **Fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence** (subsection A).  
   - **Breach of confidentiality (Article 9) or exclusivity obligations (Section 5.8)** (subsection B).  
   - **Specific indemnifiable claims** (subsections C and D).  
   This means lost profits **may still be recoverable** in these exceptional scenarios.

3. **Broad Scope of Protection**:  
   The disclaimer covers damages arising from:  
   - The agreement’s terms.  
   - The transactions contemplated by the agreement.  
   - The use of licensed compounds/products.  
   It applies **regardless of the legal theory** (contract, tort, negligence, etc.), reinforcing its comprehensiveness.

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause is a **strong limitation of liability** for lost profits and other consequential damages, which aligns with the query’s focus on disclaiming such losses. Notably:  
- It mirrors common contractual risk allocation, where parties exclude unforeseeable or indirect damages (like lost profits) to avoid open-ended liability.  
- The exceptions ensure accountability for egregious conduct (e.g., fraud) or breaches of core obligations (e.g., confidentiality).  

### Contrast with External Information:  
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) discuss **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not address limitations on monetary damages like lost profits. Clause 11.5 complements these by clarifying that while equitable relief may be available, certain monetary damages (like lost profits) are categorically excluded unless an exception applies.  

### Practical Implications:  
- A party seeking lost profits would need to prove their claim falls under one of the exceptions (e.g., fraud or breach of Article 9).  
- The clause provides predictability by capping exposure to indirect losses, which is critical in commercial agreements.  

In summary, **Clause 11.5 is a targeted disclaimer of lost profits and consequential damages**, with carefully carved-out exceptions to balance risk between the parties.",5

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING (A) THE AMOUNT OF SALES REVENUES THAT MAY OCCUR DURING THE TERM, AND (B) ANY ECONOMIC OR OTHER BENEFIT THAT THEY MIGHT OBTAIN THROUGH ITS PARTICIPATION IN THIS AGREEMENT (OTHER THAN THE SPECIFIC SUMS TO BE PAID PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT).","The clause **""8.1 Disclaimer of Warranties""** is highly relevant to the query about **disclaiming lost profits** because it explicitly limits the parties' liability for certain types of damages, including lost profits or other economic benefits that might arise from the agreement. Here’s how it addresses the query:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **General Disclaimer of Warranties**:  
   - The clause states that, except for the representations in Section 7.1, neither party makes any warranties (express or implied) about the agreement or the transactions. This includes disclaiming implied warranties like **merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement**, which could otherwise form the basis for claims of lost profits.

2. **Specific Disclaimer of Economic Benefits**:  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims any representation or warranty regarding:  
     - **Sales revenues** that may occur during the term (which could tie to lost profits if expectations are unmet).  
     - **Any economic or other benefit** (e.g., lost profits, indirect gains) that a party might expect from participating in the agreement, except for the specific payments outlined in the contract.  

3. **Exclusion of Lost Profits**:  
   - By disclaiming liability for ""any economic benefit"" beyond the sums expressly payable under the agreement, the clause effectively **bars claims for lost profits** or other consequential damages resulting from the agreement’s performance or breach. This aligns with the query’s focus on limiting exposure to such claims.

### Connection to External Information:
- The external excerpts highlight provisions about **remedies** (e.g., injunctive relief for breaches) and **conditions to the offer** (e.g., representations being true at consummation). While they don’t directly address lost profits, they underscore the agreement’s focus on limiting remedies. Clause 8.1 complements this by **excluding certain damages (like lost profits)** from recoverable remedies, reinforcing the parties’ intent to restrict liability.

### Practical Effect:
- A party seeking lost profits due to a breach or failed expectations would likely be barred by this clause, as it negates any implied guarantees of economic outcomes.  
- The clause shifts risk to the parties, ensuring that neither can rely on unstated assumptions about financial gains.

In summary, this clause directly addresses the **disclaimer of lost profits** by categorically disclaiming warranties and economic benefits not explicitly guaranteed in the agreement. It serves as a risk-allocation tool to prevent claims for indirect or speculative damages.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Points:
1. **Exclusion of Punitive Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party (LBIO, MD Anderson, or their affiliates) shall be liable for **""punitive"" damages**, among other types (special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages).  
   - This aligns with the query by clearly disclaiming liability for punitive damages, which are damages intended to punish or deter egregious conduct rather than compensate for actual loss.

2. **Scope of the Disclaimer**:  
   - The disclaimer applies broadly to claims **""in connection with or arising out of""** the agreement or any study order.  
   - However, it includes **exceptions** where punitive damages may still apply (e.g., indemnification obligations, breaches of confidentiality/IP provisions, or gross negligence/willful misconduct). This ensures the disclaimer isn’t absolute and preserves liability for intentional or severe wrongdoing.

3. **Comparison with External Context**:  
   - The external information (e.g., Section 8.5) discusses remedies like injunctive relief and specific performance but does not address punitive damages.  
   - This clause complements such provisions by clarifying that **monetary remedies for punitive damages are generally excluded**, except in specific scenarios.

### Why It Matters:
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause protects parties from unpredictable, excessive liability (like punitive damages) while carving out exceptions for misconduct or key obligations.  
- **Legal Certainty**: It ensures parties understand that punitive damages are not recoverable unless the conduct falls under the exceptions (e.g., gross negligence).  
- **Alignment with Contractual Intent**: Similar to the external text’s focus on equitable relief (e.g., injunctions), this clause reinforces that monetary damages are limited unless explicitly preserved.

### Conclusion:
The clause directly addresses the query by disclaiming punitive damages as a recoverable category of loss, subject to narrowly defined exceptions. It reflects a common contractual practice to limit exposure to non-compensatory damages while safeguarding against abuse.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Punitive Damages**:  
   - The clause states that **neither party shall be liable** for **punitive damages** (alongside other non-compensatory damages like special, incidental, or consequential damages).  
   - This is a clear disclaimer of punitive damages, which are damages intended to punish a party for egregious conduct rather than compensate for actual losses.

2. **Scope of the Limitation**:  
   - The exclusion applies to claims arising from the agreement or its termination, regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, etc.).  
   - It also clarifies that the disclaimer applies even if a party was aware of the potential for such damages (e.g., ""irrespective of whether such party has been advised of the possibility"").

3. **Exceptions**:  
   - The clause carves out an exception for liabilities arising under **Section 6.3** (not provided here), meaning punitive damages might still apply if another section of the agreement explicitly permits them.  

### Relationship to External Context:  
The external references (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 9.11**) emphasize that the parties prioritize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) over monetary damages for breaches, as monetary compensation may be inadequate. However, these sections do not override the **Section 7.4** disclaimer of punitive damages. Instead, they complement it by:  
- Reinforcing that certain breaches warrant non-monetary relief.  
- Clarifying that the limitation on damages (including punitive) does not impair the right to seek equitable remedies.  

### Practical Implications:  
- A party cannot claim punitive damages for breaches of the agreement unless another provision (like **Section 6.3**) explicitly allows it.  
- The clause protects both parties from excessive liability for non-compensatory damages, aligning with the broader contractual focus on **actual harm** and **equitable enforcement**.  

### Conclusion:  
**Section 7.4** is a standard but critical disclaimer that shields parties from punitive damages, ensuring liability is limited to compensatory or agreed-upon remedies. It operates alongside (but does not conflict with) provisions allowing equitable relief for irreparable harm.

(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","The provided clause is highly relevant to the query about **""disclaimer of punitive damages""** as it explicitly addresses limitations on liability, including punitive damages, through three key sections:

### 1. **Warranty and Liability Disclaimers (Section 11.02)**  
   - The clause disclaims liability for losses/damages sustained by the Receiving Party due to its use of the disclosed information/materials, **even if caused by negligence** (unless falling under exceptions in Section 11.04).  
   - It excludes **implied warranties** (e.g., fitness for a particular purpose), reinforcing that the Disclosing Party avoids liability for most damages arising from reliance on the materials.  

### 2. **Indirect or Enhanced Damages (Section 11.03)**  
   - **Explicitly disclaims punitive damages**: The clause states that neither party is liable for ""punitive or exemplary loss or damage"" (among other indirect damages), regardless of foreseeability.  
   - **Waiver of rights**: Parties expressly waive remedies for such damages, except for breaches of confidentiality or restricted use provisions (or under Section 11.04 exceptions).  
   - This aligns with the query by clearly excluding punitive damages from recoverable claims under the agreement.  

### 3. **Exceptions (Section 11.04)**  
   - The limitations **do not apply** to:  
     - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (retaining liability for egregious acts).  
     - **Third-party claims** (preserving indemnity rights under law).  
   - This ensures the punitive damages disclaimer is not absolute but respects legal boundaries for intentional harm or third-party rights.  

### Relevance to External Context  
The external examples (e.g., MAUD clauses) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) but do not address punitive damages. In contrast, **this clause directly answers the query** by:  
- Defining the scope of disclaimed damages (including punitive).  
- Balancing waivers with carve-outs for misconduct/third parties.  
- Demonstrating how parties contractually allocate risk for non-compensatory damages.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause is a **strong disclaimer of punitive damages** (Section 11.03) while preserving liability for gross negligence (Section 11.04). It complements the external examples by addressing damages explicitly, whereas the MAUD clauses focus on equitable relief for breaches.

2. **Exceptions**:  
   - The disclaimer **does not apply** to indemnification obligations under **Section 9** (for third-party claims). This means punitive or other excluded damages may still be recoverable in third-party indemnification scenarios.  

3. **Broad Scope of Protection**:  
   - The exclusion applies regardless of:  
     - Foreseeability of damages,  
     - Whether the party was warned of such damages,  
     - The legal theory (contract, tort, etc.) behind the claim.  
   - This makes the disclaimer **comprehensive**, covering even negligence or willful misconduct claims unless otherwise specified.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **aligns with the external references** (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 9.10* from MAUD), which emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) but do not address punitive damages.  
- While the external clauses focus on **irreparable harm** and **equitable relief**, your clause **complements them** by explicitly **waiving punitive and other non-compensatory damages** in most cases.  
- This creates a balanced framework:  
  - **Equitable remedies** (like injunctions) are preserved for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate (per the external references).  
  - **Monetary liability** is narrowly limited to direct damages, excluding punitive/exemplary damages (per your clause).  

### Practical Implications:
- The clause **protects parties from excessive liability** (e.g., in disputes where a claimant seeks punitive damages for alleged misconduct).  
- It ensures that remedies are **predictable** (limited to compensatory or contractual damages) unless third-party indemnification is triggered.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE TOOLS AND SERVICES CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.","The clause you provided (Section 14.1) is directly relevant to the query about a **""disclaimer of punitive damages""** because it explicitly limits the liability of both parties by excluding certain types of damages, including punitive damages. Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Punitive Damages**:  
   - The clause states that **""neither party shall have any liability for any indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages.""**  
   - This is a clear disclaimer of punitive damages, meaning neither party can seek or be held liable for such damages arising from breaches or other issues related to the agreement.

2. **Additional Exclusions**:  
   - The clause also disclaims liability for **indirect, special, and consequential damages** (e.g., loss of profit or business opportunities), reinforcing the parties’ intent to limit remedies to direct damages.  
   - It explicitly states that this applies **even if a party was aware such damages could occur**, further strengthening the limitation.

3. **Disclaimer of Warranties**:  
   - The second part of the clause disclaims all implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose), which aligns with the broader theme of limiting liability and remedies.  

### Connection to the External Information:
The external excerpts (Sections 8.5 and 9.10) discuss **specific performance and equitable relief** as remedies for breaches, emphasizing that monetary damages may not suffice in certain cases. However, your clause (14.1) carves out an exception to this by **excluding punitive damages entirely**, even in situations where equitable relief might otherwise apply.  

### Practical Implications:
- The clause ensures that neither party can claim **punitive damages** (which are intended to punish or deter wrongdoing) as part of any dispute resolution.  
- It shifts the focus to **actual damages** (if any are permitted under the agreement) or equitable remedies (like injunctions, as mentioned in the external excerpts).  
- This is a common risk-allocation tool in contracts, particularly in commercial agreements where parties prefer predictability over exposure to unpredictable punitive awards.  

### Conclusion:
The clause directly addresses the query by **explicitly disclaiming liability for punitive damages**, thereby shielding both parties from such claims regardless of the circumstances (unless otherwise expressly stated elsewhere in the agreement). This aligns with broader contractual trends to limit remedies to foreseeable, direct harms.

(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","The provided clause (Sections 11.02, 11.03, and 11.04) is directly relevant to the **""disclaimer of strict liability""** query, as it comprehensively limits the liability of the parties (particularly the Disclosing Party) and disclaims certain types of legal responsibility. Here’s how it addresses strict liability and related concepts:

### 1. **Disclaimer of Liability (Section 11.02)**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims liability for losses or damages sustained by the Receiving Party due to its use of or reliance on shared information/materials, **even if caused by negligence** (which includes scenarios where strict liability might otherwise apply).  
   - It excludes **implied warranties** (e.g., fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability), which are often grounds for strict liability claims under product liability or consumer protection laws.  
   - The disclaimer applies **""to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,""** signaling an intent to avoid strict liability where legally possible.  

### 2. **Exclusion of Indirect/Enhanced Damages (Section 11.03)**  
   - The clause bars liability for **consequential, indirect, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including those arising from **strict liability** (explicitly mentioned alongside tort and contract claims).  
   - Parties waive remedies for such damages unless tied to confidentiality breaches or exceptions in Section 11.04. This further narrows avenues for strict liability claims.  

### 3. **Exceptions (Section 11.04)**  
   - The limitations **do not apply** to:  
     - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (highlighting that ordinary negligence is still disclaimed, but stricter standards of fault are not).  
     - **Third-party claims** (preserving indemnity/contribution rights under law, which may include strict liability scenarios imposed by statute).  

### **Relevance to Strict Liability**  
Strict liability imposes legal responsibility without requiring proof of fault (e.g., in product liability or ultrahazardous activities). This clause:  
- Attempts to **contractually exclude strict liability** by disclaiming all warranties and capping liability even for negligence.  
- Acknowledges that certain statutory or third-party claims (e.g., under tort law) may override these disclaimers, as noted in Section 11.04(ii).  
- Aligns with the external information provided (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12), which emphasize equitable remedies but do not conflict with liability limitations for monetary damages.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause is a robust attempt to shield parties from strict liability claims, though its enforceability depends on governing law (e.g., some jurisdictions may not permit disclaimers of strict liability in consumer contracts or for certain torts). The exceptions ensure accountability for egregious conduct (gross negligence) and third-party rights, balancing risk allocation.

### 1. **Limitation of Liability for Certain Damages**  
The clause explicitly disclaims liability for **special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages** arising under the agreement, even if such damages were foreseeable or the party was advised of their possibility. This shields both parties from being held strictly liable for these categories of damages, which are often excluded in contracts to mitigate risk.

### 2. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**  
The clause carves out important exceptions where liability is **not** disclaimed:  
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: The limitation does not apply to amounts payable to third parties under indemnities (e.g., Article 10, Sections 16.1, and 16.2).  
   - **Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct**: The disclaimer does not protect a party from liability arising from **gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing**, which aligns with common legal principles that prohibit parties from contracting out of liability for egregious conduct.  

### 3. **Relevance to Strict Liability**  
Strict liability imposes responsibility without fault (e.g., regardless of negligence). By disclaiming liability for consequential damages **unless expressly provided**, the clause effectively limits strict liability exposure, except in cases of:  
   - **Express contractual indemnities** (where liability is explicitly assumed).  
   - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (where fault is a factor).  

### 4. **Alignment with External Context**  
The external references (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 10.12) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not conflict with Section 16.5. They address **enforcement of performance**, while Section 16.5 focuses on **limiting monetary liability for certain damages**. Together, they create a balanced framework:  
   - Specific performance is preserved for breaches.  
   - Liability for indirect/consequential damages is restricted unless misconduct or indemnities apply.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause is a **risk-allocation tool** that disclaims strict liability for consequential damages while preserving liability for (a) agreed indemnities and (b) culpable misconduct. It ensures parties are not unfairly penalized for unforeseeable or indirect losses but remain accountable for intentional or grossly negligent acts.

### 1. **Limitation of Liability for Certain Damages**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims liability for **indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business opportunities), even if a party was aware such damages could occur.  
   - This functions as a **partial disclaimer of strict liability** because it prevents one party from being held automatically liable for certain types of harm, regardless of fault or negligence.  

### 2. **Disclaimer of Implied Warranties**  
   - The clause states that, except as expressly provided in the agreement, **no warranties (express or implied)** are made, including:  
     - Implied warranties of **merchantability** (fitness for ordinary use).  
     - Implied warranties of **fitness for a particular purpose**.  
     - Warranties arising from **course of dealing or performance**.  
   - By disclaiming these warranties, the parties are **reducing strict liability exposure**, as implied warranties can sometimes impose liability even without negligence or fault.  

### 3. **Relevance to Strict Liability**  
   - **Strict liability** generally holds a party responsible for damages regardless of intent or negligence (e.g., in product liability cases).  
   - This clause **limits strict liability** by:  
     - Excluding certain categories of damages.  
     - Disclaiming warranties that could otherwise create strict liability obligations.  
   - However, it does **not** eliminate all strict liability risks (e.g., if applicable law imposes non-waivable liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or statutory violations).  

### 4. **Connection to External References**  
   - The external clauses (Sections 8.5 and 9.10) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable remedies**, which are separate from liability limitations.  
   - However, they reinforce that the agreement prioritizes **contractual enforcement** (e.g., injunctions) over monetary damages, aligning with the clause’s goal of limiting financial exposure.  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause **narrows liability exposure** by:  
- Excluding consequential/indirect damages.  
- Disclaiming implied warranties that could trigger strict liability.  
- Preserving only the remedies expressly stated in the agreement.  

It does **not** necessarily waive all strict liability (e.g., for intentional harm or violations of law), but it significantly limits the scope of recoverable damages and warranties.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE CONTENT. TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE.","The **""Disclaimer"" clause (Section 8.4)** is directly relevant to the query about **""disclaimer of strict liability""** because it explicitly limits the scope of representations, warranties, and liabilities assumed by the parties under the agreement. Here’s how it connects to the query and the external context:

### Key Relevance to the Query:
1. **Exclusion of Additional Warranties**:  
   - The clause states that **no representations or warranties** are made beyond those expressly stated in the agreement. This aligns with the concept of disclaiming **strict liability** (which could arise from implied warranties or statutory obligations).  
   - By disclaiming implied warranties (e.g., merchantability, fitness for a purpose), the parties avoid strict liability for defects or failures not covered by the agreement’s explicit terms.

2. **Alignment with External Context**:  
   - The external excerpts (from Pages 98 and 107) highlight that certain representations/warranties must be true at specific times (e.g., at the ""Expiration Time"" or ""consummation of the Offer"").  
   - The disclaimer reinforces that **only these specified warranties** apply, and all others are excluded. This narrows liability and prevents claims based on broader legal doctrines (e.g., strict liability in tort or under consumer protection laws).

3. **""To the Full Extent Allowed by Law""**:  
   - The clause attempts to maximize the disclaimer’s enforceability under applicable law, which is critical for avoiding strict liability. Some jurisdictions limit disclaimers of implied warranties, so this language seeks to push the boundaries of what is legally permissible.

### Why This Matters for Strict Liability:
- Strict liability often arises **without fault** (e.g., product liability claims). By disclaiming implied warranties and limiting representations, the clause reduces the risk of being held liable for issues outside the agreed-upon scope.  
- The clause shifts the burden to the other party to ensure the expressly stated warranties are sufficient, rather than relying on broader legal protections.

### Practical Implications:
- If a dispute arises, the disclaimer would be used to argue that liability is confined to the agreement’s explicit terms, not extended by default legal standards.  
- Courts may scrutinize such disclaimers for fairness and enforceability, but they are common in commercial contracts to allocate risk predictably.

In summary, **Section 8.4** is a proactive disclaimer aimed at preempting strict liability by negating unintended warranties and limiting liability to the contract’s express terms. The external context shows how such disclaimers interact with specific representations/warranties tied to transactional milestones.",5

1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims liability for **special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages** (e.g., lost profits), even if the liable party was aware such damages could occur.  
   - This functions as a **partial disclaimer of strict liability**, as it limits the scope of recoverable damages, even in cases where liability might otherwise be imposed without fault (e.g., under strict liability theories in contract or tort).

2. **Exceptions to the Limitation**  
   - The clause carves out exceptions for:  
     - **Indemnity obligations** (preserving claims for third-party liabilities).  
     - **Confidentiality breaches** (protecting sensitive information).  
     - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (ensuring accountability for egregious conduct).  
   - These exceptions imply that **strict liability may still apply in these specific scenarios**, as the parties did not intend to waive liability for intentional or reckless harm.

3. **Relationship to External Context**  
   - The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 9.10*) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches, but they do not conflict with this clause.  
   - The limitation here focuses on **monetary damages**, while the external clauses address **non-monetary relief**. Together, they create a framework where:  
     - **Strict liability for damages is limited** (per Section 29.0).  
     - **Non-monetary enforcement remains available** (per the cited sections).  

### Key Takeaway  
This clause **disclaims strict liability for certain categories of damages** (e.g., consequential losses) but preserves liability for indemnity, confidentiality breaches, and intentional misconduct. It operates alongside (but does not override) equitable remedies like specific performance.

The provided **ARTICLE X** clause is a **broad waiver of indirect and consequential damages**, which aligns closely with the query. Here’s how it relates:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for **consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages** (including lost profits/revenues) arising from the agreement or its breach.  
   - This is a **unilateral waiver** (applying equally to both parties unless specified otherwise) and covers damages that are often excluded in contracts to limit liability.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply to third-party claims** (e.g., indemnification obligations for claims brought by unaffiliated third parties, including claims for indirect/consequential damages).  
   - This preserves liability for damages imposed by external parties, even if the parties waive such claims against each other.

3. **Broad Applicability**:  
   - The waiver applies **regardless of negligence, fault, or pre-existing conditions**, making it comprehensive and enforceable even in scenarios where one party might otherwise be at fault.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause is a **standard unilateral waiver of indirect damages**, which directly addresses the query’s focus on limiting liability for non-direct losses.  
- It contrasts with the **external information** provided (Sections 8.5 and 9.10), which emphasize **specific performance and equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) as remedies for breaches. Those sections highlight that monetary damages may be inadequate, while **ARTICLE X** clarifies that certain monetary damages (indirect/consequential) are categorically waived.  
- The clause ensures predictability in liability exposure, which is often negotiated in commercial contracts to avoid open-ended financial risks.

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Allocation**: Parties agree upfront that indirect damages (e.g., lost profits) are excluded, reducing litigation risk over speculative losses.  
- **Third-Party Protection**: The carve-out for third-party claims ensures indemnification rights remain intact, balancing the waiver’s scope.  

In summary, this clause is a **strong example of a unilateral indirect damages waiver**, tailored to protect both parties from secondary financial impacts while preserving remedies for direct harms and third-party liabilities.",5

In any action or proceeding between the Parties (including any arbitration proceeding) arising under or with respect to this Agreement or in any manner pertaining to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or to the relationship of the Parties under this Agreement, each Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and releases any right, power or privilege either may have to claim or receive from the other Party any punitive or exemplary damages, each Party acknowledging and agreeing that the remedies herein provided and other remedies at law or in equity will in all circumstances be adequate. Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The **""Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages"" clause (Section 14)** is directly relevant to the query about a **unilateral indirect damages waiver** in the following ways:

### 1. **Scope of Waiver**  
   - The clause explicitly waives the right to claim **punitive or exemplary damages** (non-compensatory damages) in disputes arising under the agreement.  
   - While not framed as ""indirect damages,"" punitive/exemplary damages are often considered indirect because they are not tied to direct financial loss but are instead imposed to punish or deter misconduct.  

### 2. **Unilateral vs. Mutual Waiver**  
   - The waiver is **mutual** (both parties waive claims against each other), not unilateral. However, it aligns with the concept of limiting remedies to compensatory damages (e.g., direct losses) and excluding broader categories like punitive damages, which could be argued as a form of indirect harm.  

### 3. **Relevance to Indirect Damages**  
   - Though the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect damages,"" punitive/exemplary damages are a subset of non-compensatory damages that parties often seek to exclude alongside consequential or indirect damages.  
   - The clause reinforces that remedies under the agreement (and at law/equity) are deemed ""adequate,"" implicitly excluding claims for damages beyond compensatory relief.  

### 4. **Connection to External Context**  
   - The external references (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10) emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** as remedies for breaches, suggesting the agreement prioritizes enforceable performance over monetary damages.  
   - Section 14 complements this by further narrowing the types of damages available, ensuring parties cannot seek punitive damages even if other equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are pursued.  

### Key Takeaway  
While the clause does not use the term ""indirect damages,"" it functions similarly by waiving a category of damages (punitive/exemplary) that are typically non-compensatory and indirectly related to actual harm. For a **unilateral** waiver, the clause would need to bind only one party, but its structure here is mutual.  

If the query seeks a unilateral waiver, this clause could be adapted by specifying that only one party waives such claims (e.g., ""Party A hereby waives...""). The clause’s rationale—limiting remedies to compensatory measures—aligns with the intent behind waiving indirect damages.

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
   - The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for **indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, business, or data) arising from the agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.  
   - This is a **bilateral** (not unilateral) waiver, as it applies to both parties equally unless an exception (like indemnification or breach of confidentiality) is triggered.  

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**  
   - The waiver does not apply if:  
     - Damages are awarded to a third party in a judgment where indemnification applies (under **Section 7.2**).  
     - The damages arise from a breach of confidentiality (**Section 11.4**).  
     - The clause clarifies that liquidated damages under **Section 10.5.2** are also excluded from this limitation.  

3. **Cap on Liability**  
   - **Section 8.3** further limits aggregate liability (except for indemnification claims) to a specified amount ([***]), reinforcing the parties’ intent to restrict exposure to excessive damages.  

### Relevance to ""Unilateral Indirect Damages Waiver"":
- While the clause is **bilateral** (applying to both parties), it could be considered ""unilateral"" in practice if one party is more likely to face claims for indirect damages (e.g., a service provider vs. a client). However, the text does not explicitly favor one party over the other.  
- The clause aligns with the concept of a waiver of indirect damages by excluding liability for consequential losses, which is a common contractual risk-allocation tool.  

### Connection to External Context:  
The external references (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 9.11**) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate. These sections complement the damages waiver by clarifying that non-monetary remedies remain available despite the limitation on indirect damages.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause is a **mutual waiver of indirect/consequential damages** with carve-outs for indemnification, confidentiality breaches, and liquidated damages. It is not strictly unilateral but could function asymmetrically depending on the parties’ roles. If the query seeks a truly unilateral waiver (where only one party is protected), the clause would need to be revised to single out one party’s liability.

### Relevance of the Clause to the Query:  
The provided clause (**Section 16.5 - Disclaimer of Liability for Consequential Damages**) is a **mutual waiver** (not unilateral) of liability for certain types of damages, including:  
- **Special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages**  
- Damages arising from **contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or other legal theories**  
- Even if such damages were **foreseeable** or the party was **advised of the possibility** of such losses.  

However, the clause **does not create a unilateral waiver**—it applies equally to **both parties** (Array and Ono).  

### Key Observations:  
1. **Not Unilateral, but Mutual**:  
   - The clause binds **both parties**, not just one. A unilateral waiver would explicitly state that only one party is waiving claims (e.g., ""Licensee waives all claims for indirect damages against Licensor"").  
   - The phrase **""IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY... BE LIABLE""** confirms mutual application.  

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** to:  
     - Indemnification claims under **Article 10, Sections 16.1, and 16.2** (third-party claims).  
     - Cases involving **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  

3. **Comparison with External References**:  
   - The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5, Section 10.12**) discuss **irreparable harm and equitable remedies** (injunctions, specific performance) but do not address **damages waivers**.  
   - The query seeks a **unilateral** waiver, whereas the clause is **bilateral**.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause is **relevant to the query** in that it defines a **mutual exclusion of indirect/consequential damages**, but it does **not** establish a **unilateral waiver**. If the intent is to draft a **one-sided waiver**, the clause would need modification to specify that only **one party** (not ""either party"") is waiving such claims.

unilateral indirect damages waiver,e9bb33ad41,"9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY/MAXIMUM DAMAGES ALLOWED
9.1. Equitable Relief. Either party may seek equitable remedies, including injunctive relief, for a breach of the other party's obligations under Article 13 of this Agreement, prior to commencing the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 11.1 below.
9.2. Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages. Independent of, severable from, and to be enforced independently of any other provision of this Agreement, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (NOR TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS) IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KINDâ€”including lost profits, loss of business, or other economic damage, and further including injury to property, AS A RESULT OF BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED, HAD OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.
9.4. Statute of Limitations. No lawsuit or other action may be brought by either party hereto, or on any claim or controversy based upon or arising in any way out of this Agreement, after two(2) years from the date on which the party knew or reasonably should have known of an event for which a cause of action arose regardless of the nature of the claim or form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise; provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to the collection of any amounts due Metavante under this Agreement.
9.5. Tort Claim Waiver. In addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this Article 9, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives any right to recover from the other party, and Customer waives any right to recover from any Eligible Provider, any economic losses or damages in any action brought under tort theories, including, misrepresentation, negligence and/or strict liability, and/or relating to the quality or performance of any products or services provided by Metavante. For purposes of this waiver, economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service except personal injury or damage to other tangible property. Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.
9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination. Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.
9.7. Essential Elements. Customer and Metavante acknowledge and agree that the limitations contained in this Article 9 are essential to this Agreement, and that Metavante has expressly relied upon the inclusion of each and every provision of this Article 9 as a condition to executing this Agreement.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about a **""unilateral indirect damages waiver""** because it outlines a comprehensive limitation of liability framework that includes waivers of certain types of damages, including indirect and consequential damages. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance to ""Unilateral Indirect Damages Waiver"":
1. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**  
   - The clause explicitly states that **neither party will be liable** for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages** (e.g., lost profits, loss of business, economic harm).  
   - This is a **bilateral waiver** (both parties waive these damages), but if one party were to impose this waiver on the other without reciprocity, it could be considered **unilateral**.  
   - The waiver is **indirect** because it covers damages that are not direct (e.g., secondary losses like lost profits rather than direct costs of breach).

2. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
   - Each party waives the right to recover **economic losses or damages** under tort theories (e.g., negligence, misrepresentation).  
   - This reinforces the **indirect damages waiver** by excluding claims that might otherwise circumvent contractual limitations.  
   - The waiver is framed as **unilateral in effect** (e.g., the Customer waives claims against Eligible Providers, but Metavante’s protections are broader).

3. **Liquidated Damages (Section 9.6)**  
   - The clause substitutes uncertain indirect damages (e.g., business impact from early termination) with a fixed **Termination Fee**, further limiting exposure to indirect losses.  

4. **Essential Elements (Section 9.7)**  
   - The parties acknowledge that these limitations are **material to the agreement**, suggesting that without them, the contract might not have been formed. This underscores the **unilateral** nature of certain protections (e.g., Metavante’s reliance on these waivers as a condition for signing).  

### Comparison to External Information:
The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) emphasize **equitable relief** (injunctions, specific performance) for breaches but do not address **waivers of indirect damages**. Your clause, however, **complements** those provisions by:  
- Explicitly **excluding monetary remedies** for indirect damages (where equitable relief is insufficient).  
- Reinforcing that **even if equitable remedies fail**, tort claims for economic losses are waived (Section 9.5).  

### Conclusion:
This clause is a **strong example of a unilateral indirect damages waiver** because:  
- It **favors one party** (Metavante) in practice (e.g., Customer waives claims against Eligible Providers, but Metavante retains broader protections).  
- It **systematically eliminates liability** for indirect, consequential, and tort-based economic damages.  
- It treats these waivers as **essential to the agreement**, making them enforceable even if other remedies fail.  

If the query seeks to **draft or analyze a unilateral waiver**, this clause provides a template for excluding indirect damages while preserving equitable remedies and liquidated damages as alternatives.",5

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause states that **neither party** will be liable to the other for **consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages**, or **loss of profits/revenues**.  
   - This is a **mutual** waiver (applying to both parties equally), which addresses the ""mutual"" aspect of the query.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   - The waiver does **not** apply to third-party claims (e.g., indemnification obligations for claims brought by unaffiliated third parties, even if those claims include indirect damages).  
   - This ensures the waiver is narrowly tailored to disputes between the contracting parties themselves.

3. **Broad Applicability**:  
   - The waiver applies **regardless of negligence, fault, or pre-existing conditions**, reinforcing its comprehensive scope.  
   - This aligns with the intent of a mutual waiver to limit exposure to unpredictable or disproportionate liabilities.

### Connection to the External Information:  
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief** as remedies for breaches, emphasizing that monetary damages may be inadequate. However, the **Waiver of Certain Damages** clause complements these provisions by:  
   - Clarifying that **certain monetary damages** (e.g., indirect/consequential) are categorically excluded, even if other remedies (like injunctions) remain available.  
   - Ensuring that the parties’ recourse is limited to **specific performance or direct damages**, not indirect losses.  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
A ""mutual indirect damages waiver"" is typically negotiated to:  
   - Reduce litigation risk over hard-to-quantify damages (e.g., lost profits).  
   - Allocate risk predictably between parties.  
   - Align with broader contract remedies (e.g., preserving equitable relief while waiving certain monetary claims).  

This clause achieves those goals by **explicitly waiving mutual liability for indirect damages** while carving out third-party claims and preserving other remedies.  

**Conclusion**: The clause is a clear example of a mutual indirect damages waiver, with carefully defined exceptions and broad applicability.",5
mutual indirect damages waiver,0dd1d92b6d,"14. Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages. In any action or proceeding between the Parties (including any arbitration proceeding) arising under or with respect to this Agreement or in any manner pertaining to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or to the relationship of the Parties under this Agreement, each Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and releases any right, power or privilege either may have to claim or receive from the other Party any punitive or exemplary damages, each Party acknowledging and agreeing that the remedies herein provided and other remedies at law or in equity will in all circumstances be adequate. Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The **""Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages""** clause (Section 14) is directly relevant to the query about a **mutual indirect damages waiver** because it establishes a reciprocal agreement between the parties to waive certain types of damages that are not tied to direct, compensatory losses. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of a mutual indirect damages waiver:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Waiver of Punitive/Exemplary Damages**:  
   - Both parties waive the right to claim **punitive or exemplary damages** (which are non-compensatory and intended to punish or deter misconduct rather than compensate for actual loss).  
   - This reflects a mutual limitation on indirect or consequential damages that go beyond direct losses.

2. **Scope of the Waiver**:  
   - The waiver applies broadly to disputes ""arising under or with respect to this Agreement,"" including arbitration and actions related to the parties’ relationship.  
   - This covers indirect claims tied to the contractual relationship, reinforcing the mutual nature of the waiver.

3. **Adequacy of Remedies**:  
   - The clause emphasizes that compensatory remedies (e.g., monetary damages for actual losses) and equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) are deemed sufficient.  
   - This aligns with the external references (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10), which highlight equitable relief as a primary remedy for breaches, further supporting the waiver of non-compensatory damages.

4. **Intent and Sophistication of Parties**:  
   - The parties acknowledge their experience in negotiating such agreements and their understanding of the waiver’s implications. This strengthens enforceability of the mutual waiver.

### Connection to ""Mutual Indirect Damages Waiver"":
- **Indirect Damages**: Punitive/exemplary damages are a subset of indirect damages (i.e., not directly tied to breach-related losses). By waiving them, the clause indirectly limits liability for certain consequential harms.  
- **Mutuality**: The waiver is bilateral, ensuring neither party can seek these damages from the other, which is a hallmark of mutual waivers.  
- **Complement to Equitable Relief**: The external references stress equitable remedies (specific performance) as adequate, reinforcing the clause’s purpose to exclude non-compensatory claims.

### Why This Matters:
- **Risk Allocation**: The clause allocates risk by excluding unpredictable, non-economic damages, promoting contractual certainty.  
- **Enforceability**: Courts often uphold such waivers when parties are sophisticated and explicitly acknowledge their intent (as here).  

In summary, this clause functions as a **mutual waiver of indirect, non-compensatory damages** (punitive/exemplary), which is a critical component of broader indirect damages waivers in contracts. It works alongside provisions like specific performance (cited in the external references) to define the scope of permissible remedies.",5

The provided clause (Sections 8.2 and 8.3) is a clear example of such a waiver and is highly relevant to the query for the following reasons:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Mutual Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**  
   - Both parties agree that neither will be liable to the other for:  
     - **Indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, business, or data).  
     - **Cost of cover** (e.g., expenses incurred to replace undelivered goods/services).  
   - This waiver applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, etc.), unless an exception applies (e.g., indemnification for third-party claims or breaches of confidentiality under Section 11.4).  
   - The clause explicitly states that the parties are waiving these damages **even if advised of their possibility**, reinforcing the mutual intent to exclude such liabilities.  

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**  
   - The waiver does **not** apply to:  
     - Indemnifiable claims under Section 7.2 (e.g., third-party judgments).  
     - Breaches of confidentiality (Section 11.4).  
     - Liquidated damages under Section 10.5.2 (explicitly carved out).  

3. **Cap on Liability (Section 8.3)**  
   - Further limits liability by capping each party’s aggregate damages (except for indemnification claims) to a specified amount ([***]).  
   - This reinforces the mutual limitation of risk, ensuring predictability in potential exposure.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause is a **bilateral (mutual) waiver**, meaning both parties equally forego claims for indirect/consequential damages.  
- It aligns with the broader contractual intent seen in the external references (e.g., MAUD_102 and MAUD_630), where parties prioritize **specific performance** or **equitable relief** over monetary damages for breaches, recognizing that some harms cannot be adequately remedied by money alone.  
- The exceptions (indemnity, confidentiality, liquidated damages) demonstrate nuanced drafting to balance risk allocation while maintaining core protections.  

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Allocation**: Parties agree upfront that unforeseeable or disproportionate losses (e.g., lost profits) are excluded, reducing litigation risk over speculative damages.  
- **Focus on Direct Remedies**: The clause channels disputes toward measurable damages (e.g., capped amounts) or non-monetary relief (e.g., injunctions, as highlighted in the external references).  

In summary, this clause is a **direct response** to the query, illustrating a comprehensive mutual waiver of indirect damages with carefully defined exceptions and limitations. It reflects standard practice in commercial contracts to mitigate open-ended liability risks.",5

The provided clause (**Sections 12.3 and 12.4**) directly addresses this concept. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - Explicitly states that **no party will be liable** for:  
     - Indirect damages  
     - Consequential damages  
     - Special damages  
     - Loss of profits  
   - **Exception**: This waiver does *not* apply to indemnification obligations for **Indemnifiable Losses** (e.g., third-party claims).  

2. **Monetary Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - Further limits liability by capping each party’s aggregate financial exposure to a specified amount (redacted as `$[* * *]`).  
   - Applies to **all claims**, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or under indemnification provisions.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause is a **mutual waiver** (binding both parties) of indirect/consequential damages, which is a common feature in contracts to mitigate unpredictable financial risks.  
- It balances the waiver with:  
  - A carve-out for indemnifiable losses (ensuring core protections remain intact).  
  - A separate liability cap to provide further certainty on exposure.  

### Connection to External Context:  
The external excerpts (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 9.10*) emphasize **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches, but they do *not* conflict with the damages waiver. Instead, they complement it by:  
- Clarifying that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches (justifying equitable relief).  
- Reinforcing that the waiver of indirect damages does *not* impair rights to non-monetary remedies (like specific performance).  

### Practical Implications:
- **Risk Allocation**: Parties accept that they cannot recover certain remote or speculative damages (e.g., lost profits) but retain rights to direct damages and indemnification.  
- **Certainty**: The liability cap provides a clear upper bound for financial exposure, aiding risk assessment.  

In summary, the clause is a **standard mutual indirect damages waiver** with tailored exceptions and limitations, aligning with the query’s focus on excluding liability for consequential losses while preserving other remedies.",5

The provided clause (**Sections 12.3 and 12.4**) directly addresses this concept. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Mutual Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - The clause explicitly states that **no party will be liable** for:  
     - Indirect damages  
     - Consequential damages  
     - Special damages  
     - Loss of profits  
   - This is a **mutual waiver**, meaning both parties agree to exclude these categories of damages from potential claims against each other.  
   - **Exception**: The waiver does not apply to indemnifiable losses (e.g., third-party claims covered under indemnification provisions).

2. **Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - Further reinforces the mutual waiver by capping each party’s **total liability** (for all causes) to a specified dollar amount (""$[* * *]"").  
   - This applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence) or whether the damages were foreseeable.  
   - The cap does **not** override the broader exclusion of indirect/consequential damages in Section 12.3.

### Connection to External Context:  
The external excerpts (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 9.10**) emphasize the parties’ right to **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches, noting that monetary damages may be inadequate. However, these sections do **not** conflict with the indirect damages waiver in **12.3–12.4** because:  
- Equitable relief addresses **enforcement of contractual obligations**, not monetary compensation for indirect losses.  
- The waiver in **12.3** specifically carves out indemnification obligations, preserving remedies for direct losses (e.g., third-party claims).  

### Why This Matters for the Query:  
A ""mutual indirect damages waiver"" is typically negotiated to:  
- Reduce litigation risk over speculative or hard-to-quantify losses.  
- Allocate risk predictably (e.g., capping liability to a fixed amount).  
- Align with industry standards (common in M&A, tech, and service contracts).  

The provided clause is a **clear example** of such a waiver, with structured exceptions (indemnification) and complementary liability limits.

Here’s how the clause relates to the query and the external context:

### Key Points from the Clause (Article X):
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause states that neither party is liable for **indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages** (among others) arising from the agreement or its breach. This directly addresses the ""indirect damage waiver"" mentioned in the query.
   
2. **Exceptions**: The waiver does not apply to third-party claims (e.g., indemnification obligations for claims by unaffiliated third parties, including claims for indirect/consequential damages). This shows the waiver is **not absolute** and is subject to carve-outs.

3. **Non-Limitation of Equitable Remedies**: While the clause limits monetary damages, it does not restrict equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance). This aligns with the external information (Sections 8.5 and 9.10), which emphasize that equitable relief remains available despite any limitations on damages.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause confirms that the **indirect damage waiver is enforceable under the agreement**, but its scope is subject to:
  - **Contractual exceptions** (e.g., third-party claims).
  - **Legal limitations** (e.g., equitable remedies, as highlighted in the external provisions).
  
- The external information clarifies that:
  - Parties retain rights to **specific performance and injunctive relief** even if monetary damages are waived (Section 8.5(c)).
  - Courts may still enforce equitable remedies if a breach causes irreparable harm (Section 9.10), implying that the waiver of indirect damages does not override statutory or common-law rights to non-monetary relief.

### Conclusion:
The indirect damage waiver in Article X is **subject to law** in the sense that:
1. It is **contractually valid** but must be interpreted alongside other provisions (e.g., equitable remedies).
2. It cannot override **legal principles** (e.g., courts' authority to grant injunctions or specific performance).
3. Its enforceability may depend on jurisdiction-specific rules governing waivers of liability.

Thus, while the clause broadly waives indirect damages, its application is constrained by both the agreement's own terms and external legal standards.",5

### **1. Indirect Damage Waiver in the Clause**  
The clause states:  
> *""THE PROVIDER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES... INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF REVENUES OR LOSS OF PROFIT.""*  

This is a **waiver of liability for indirect damages**, meaning the provider is shielded from claims for losses like lost profits or business interruption, even if notified of such risks.  

### **2. Relevance to the Query: ""Subject to Law""**  
The clause’s enforceability depends on applicable law, as highlighted in the external references:  
- **Section 8.5 (Applicable Law; Jurisdiction)** and **Section 9.10 (Specific Performance)** confirm that:  
  - Parties may seek equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) if monetary damages are inadequate.  
  - Waivers of legal remedies (e.g., ""no liability for consequential damages"") are subject to judicial scrutiny.  

#### **Key Legal Considerations:**  
- **Contractual Freedom vs. Legal Limits**: While parties can agree to limit liability, courts may invalidate waivers if they:  
  - Violate public policy (e.g., gross negligence, fraud).  
  - Are unconscionable or overly one-sided.  
  - Conflict with mandatory statutory protections (e.g., consumer or employment laws).  
- **Equitable Remedies**: The external clauses emphasize that parties retain rights to equitable relief (e.g., specific performance) despite liability limitations. Thus, a court could override the waiver if enforcing it would cause ""irreparable harm.""  

### **3. Practical Implications**  
- The waiver is **valid only to the extent permitted by governing law** (e.g., U.S. courts often uphold consequential damage exclusions in commercial contracts but may carve out exceptions for willful misconduct or gross negligence).  
- The external sections suggest that **even with the waiver, a party could seek injunctive relief** if the limitation undermines the agreement’s purpose (e.g., if the provider’s breach threatens the company’s survival).  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause’s indirect damage waiver is **subject to law** in two ways:  
1. **Enforceability**: It must comply with statutory and judicial limits on liability exclusions.  
2. **Equitable Override**: Courts may disregard it if equity demands alternative remedies (per Sections 8.5 and 9.10).  

Thus, while the waiver is binding under contract principles, its application depends on the governing law’s constraints.",5

Here’s how the clause is relevant:

### 1. **Indirect Damages Waiver (Section 27.2)**  
   - The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for **indirect, special, or consequential damages**, even if foreseeable or communicated.  
   - However, this waiver is **subject to legal limitations**, as implied by:  
     - **Section 27.1**, which clarifies that liability cannot be excluded for **gross negligence, wilful misconduct, fraud, death, personal injury, or any other liability that cannot be limited under applicable law**.  
     - This means the waiver of indirect damages is **not absolute** and must comply with mandatory legal standards (e.g., statutory prohibitions on limiting liability for certain types of harm).

### 2. **Acknowledged Direct Damages (Section 27.3)**  
   - Certain breaches (e.g., confidentiality, data security) are **exempted from the indirect damages waiver** and treated as **direct damages**.  
   - This reinforces that the waiver is **context-specific** and does not override legal or contractual obligations where liability is expressly preserved.

### 3. **Statutory Overrides (Section 27.1)**  
   - The clause explicitly defers to **mandatory law**, stating that exclusions/limitations do not apply where prohibited by law (e.g., consumer protection laws, tort liability for negligence).  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus: an indirect damage waiver is **enforceable only to the extent permitted by law**.

### 4. **External Context (Specific Performance)**  
   - The external information (Section 7.11) highlights that parties may seek **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate.  
   - While not directly about indirect damages, this underscores that contractual waivers are **subordinate to legal and equitable principles**.

### **Conclusion**  
The clause confirms that an **indirect damage waiver is subject to law**:  
- It is **valid for contractual purposes** but **void where law prohibits exclusion** (e.g., for gross negligence, statutory liabilities).  
- Courts may disregard such waivers if they conflict with **public policy or mandatory legal standards**.  

Thus, the clause explicitly acknowledges that its enforceability depends on **applicable law**, answering the query affirmatively.",5

Here’s how:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly disclaims liability for **special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages** unless expressly provided under the agreement.  
   - This waiver applies even if such damages are foreseeable or the party was advised of their possibility.  

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** to:  
     - Indemnification obligations to third parties under **Article 10, Sections 16.1, and 16.2** (e.g., claims by non-parties).  
     - Cases involving **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  

3. **Legal Subjection**:  
   - The clause acknowledges that its enforceability is subject to applicable law. For example:  
     - Many jurisdictions uphold waivers of consequential damages in commercial contracts, **unless prohibited by statute or public policy** (e.g., certain consumer protections or gross negligence exceptions).  
     - The external references (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 10.12**) highlight that equitable remedies (like injunctions) may still apply despite contractual limitations, reinforcing that the waiver operates within legal boundaries.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause demonstrates that while parties may **contractually waive indirect damages**, such waivers are **not absolute** and are subject to:  
  - **Mandatory legal standards** (e.g., gross negligence carve-outs).  
  - **Jurisdictional rules** (e.g., Delaware law in the external citations, which permits waivers but preserves equitable remedies).  
- The phrase **""unless expressly provided hereunder""** implies that the waiver’s scope is tied to the agreement’s terms and governing law.  

### Conclusion:
The clause confirms that an indirect damage waiver is **subject to law**—it can be enforced only to the extent permitted by applicable legal principles (e.g., no waiver for intentional misconduct) and may coexist with other statutory or equitable rights. The external context (e.g., Delaware’s emphasis on specific performance) further underscores this interplay between contractual terms and legal constraints.

indirect damage waiver is subject to law,95e0cedd33,"8.3 Limitation of Damages. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES UNDER SECTION 7.2 [Indemnity], NEITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL EXCEED [***].","The query asks whether an **indirect damage waiver is subject to law**, and the provided **Clause 8.3 (Limitation of Damages)** is relevant in the following ways:

### 1. **Indirect Damage Waiver & Legal Enforceability**  
- Clause 8.3 limits liability for damages **except for indemnity obligations (Section 7.2)**, capping a party’s total liability at a specified amount (redacted as `[***]`).  
- This clause effectively waives liability for **indirect, consequential, or incidental damages** (unless indemnity applies), but its enforceability depends on governing law.  
- Some jurisdictions may restrict or invalidate such waivers if deemed unconscionable or against public policy (e.g., certain consumer protection laws or cases involving gross negligence/willful misconduct).  

### 2. **Interaction with External Provisions (Specific Performance)**  
- The external excerpts (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 9.10**) emphasize that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) remain available despite limitations on monetary damages.  
- These sections clarify that:  
  - The parties waive the defense that ""a remedy at law (monetary damages) would be adequate"" for breaches.  
  - **Limitations in Clause 8.3 do not override rights to equitable relief** (e.g., enforcing the agreement’s terms via specific performance).  
  - Thus, while indirect damages may be waived under Clause 8.3, non-monetary remedies are preserved under applicable law.  

### 3. **Key Takeaway**  
- **Clause 8.3’s waiver of indirect damages is subject to legal constraints**:  
  - It may not apply to indemnified claims (Section 7.2).  
  - Courts may disregard the waiver if it conflicts with mandatory law (e.g., fraud, statutory liabilities).  
  - Equitable remedies survive per the agreement’s broader terms (Sections 8.5/9.10).  

### Conclusion  
The clause limits liability for indirect damages but remains subordinate to:  
1. **Mandatory law** (if the waiver is unenforceable under governing law).  
2. **Preserved equitable remedies** (specific performance, injunctions).  
3. **Explicit carve-outs** (e.g., indemnity obligations in Section 7.2).  

Thus, the waiver’s validity hinges on the applicable legal framework and the agreement’s integrated provisions.",5
indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,32762b4bf5,"ARTICLE 9 - INDEMNIFICATION
Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;
(4) If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, with a reservation of all rights to seek indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party; provided, that Indemnitee may enter into a settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the indemnifying party, if the terms of such settlement (i) include only money damages as a remedy, (ii) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on the indemnifying party's business and (iii) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by the indemnifying party; and
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The query concerns an **""indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver""**, which typically refers to exceptions or limitations to indemnification obligations—specifically excluding certain types of damages (e.g., indirect, consequential, or punitive damages) from indemnifiable losses. Here’s how the provided **Article 9 - Indemnification** clause relates to the query:

### 1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
The clause broadly covers indemnification for ""any and all loss, damage, injury, or liability"" arising from third-party claims due to:  
   - Breach of the agreement, or  
   - Negligence/willful misconduct.  
   - **Key phrase**: ""to the extent resulting **directly or indirectly**"" (Section 9.1(a)).  

   This suggests that **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential losses) are *potentially* included in indemnifiable losses unless explicitly carved out.  

### 2. **Absence of Indirect Damage Waiver**  
The clause does **not** expressly exclude indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) from indemnifiable losses. In contrast, many contracts include explicit carveouts stating that indemnification does not cover consequential or indirect damages.  
   - **Relevance to Query**: The lack of such a carveout here means indirect damages *may* still be recoverable under indemnification, unless limited by other provisions (e.g., Section 8.3(d) referenced in the external MAUD snippets).  

### 3. **Interaction with External Context**  
The external MAUD snippets highlight:  
   - **Specific performance** (equitable relief) as a remedy for breaches (Section 9.10).  
   - **Limitations** on remedies (e.g., Section 8.3(d) in MAUD_446).  

   If the agreement elsewhere (e.g., in a ""Limitation of Liability"" clause) waives indirect damages, that could implicitly carve them out from indemnification. However, **this clause does not address that directly**.  

### 4. **Claims Procedure Nuances**  
   - Settlements involving **money damages** (Section 9.1(b)(3)) are permitted without Indemnitee consent if they meet certain criteria, but this does not distinguish between direct/indirect damages.  
   - The indemnifying party controls defense strategies (Section 9.1(b)(2)), but again, no explicit carveout for indirect damages is mentioned.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause is relevant to the query because it:  
1. **Does not expressly exclude indirect damages** from indemnifiable losses, implying they may be covered unless contradicted by other provisions.  
2. **Leaves room for interpretation**—if the parties intended to waive indirect damages for indemnification, a carveout should be added (e.g., ""Indemnification does not cover consequential, incidental, or punitive damages"").  

**Recommendation**: To align with the query’s intent, the clause should be amended to explicitly exclude indirect damages (if desired) or cross-referenced with a broader limitation of liability provision.

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - The clause states that **no party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including lost profits**.  
   - However, it **explicitly carves out indemnification obligations** by stating:  
     > *""This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.""*  
   - This means that while most claims for indirect damages are waived, **indemnification claims (e.g., for third-party claims, breaches of representations, or other covered losses) can still include indirect or consequential damages** if they qualify as ""Indemnifiable Losses.""  

2. **Overall Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - Even though indemnification claims can include indirect damages, **total liability is still capped** at a specified amount (redacted as $[* * *]).  
   - This means that while indemnifiable losses are not excluded from including indirect/consequential damages, the **maximum exposure is still limited**.  

### **Connection to External References (Specific Performance Clauses)**  
The external references discuss **specific performance and equitable relief**, emphasizing that monetary damages may not always suffice for breaches. While not directly related to indemnification carveouts, they reinforce that:  
- Certain breaches (e.g., failure to close a deal) may justify **non-monetary remedies** (injunctions, specific performance).  
- The indemnification carveout here ensures that **financial consequences of breaches (including indirect damages) remain recoverable under indemnity**, even if general liability for indirect damages is waived.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause is directly responsive to the query because it:  
- **Waives liability for indirect/consequential damages generally** (Section 12.3).  
- **Carves out indemnification obligations** from this waiver, allowing recovery of indirect damages **if they qualify as Indemnifiable Losses**.  
- **Imposes an overall cap on liability** (Section 12.4), which applies even to indemnifiable claims.

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query:**  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - The clause states that **no party is liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including lost profits**.  
   - However, it **explicitly carves out indemnification obligations** by stating:  
     > *""This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.""*  
   - This means that **indemnifiable losses (e.g., third-party claims, breaches of representations, etc.) can still include indirect or consequential damages**, even though such damages are otherwise excluded under the general liability waiver.  

2. **Overall Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - While indemnifiable losses can include indirect damages, the **total liability is still capped** at a specified amount (e.g., $[* * *]).  
   - This ensures that even if indemnification covers indirect damages, the **maximum exposure is controlled**.  

### **Connection to External References (Specific Performance Clauses)**  
The external references discuss **specific performance and irreparable harm**, emphasizing that monetary damages may not suffice for breaches. While not directly related to indemnification carveouts, they reinforce that:  
- **Equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are preserved** even if monetary damages are limited.  
- **Indemnification carveouts ensure that certain breaches (e.g., third-party claims) remain fully compensable**, including indirect damages, while other claims (e.g., pure contractual breaches) may be subject to waivers.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause is **directly responsive to the query** because it:  
- **Waives indirect/consequential damages generally** (Section 12.3).  
- **Carves out indemnification obligations** from that waiver, allowing recovery of indirect damages **only in indemnification scenarios**.  
- **Imposes an overall liability cap** (Section 12.4), balancing broad indemnification rights with financial predictability.

indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The **indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver** query relates to whether indirect damages (e.g., consequential, incidental, or special damages) are excluded from indemnification obligations under the clause. Here’s how the provided **Section 24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION** is relevant:

### Key Observations:
1. **Scope of Indemnification**:  
   - The clause covers **direct claims** (e.g., third-party claims for bodily injury or property damage) arising from negligence or intentional acts.  
   - It does **not explicitly mention indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or consequential losses).  

2. **Carveout for Indirect Damages**:  
   - The indemnification is limited to tangible harms (bodily injury, property damage) and excludes **intangible losses** like lost data (explicitly stated).  
   - This implies an **implied carveout for indirect damages**, as the clause focuses on direct, quantifiable losses tied to third-party claims.  

3. **Allocation of Fault**:  
   - If the indemnified party’s negligence contributes to the claim, liability is **proportionally reduced**. This further supports that indemnification is tied to **direct, attributable damages** rather than indirect or speculative losses.  

4. **External Context**:  
   - The referenced external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **7.11**) emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches, but they do not conflict with the indemnification carveout. They address remedies for non-performance, not indemnification for third-party claims.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **indirectly carves out indirect damages** by:  
- Limiting indemnification to **tangible, direct harms** (bodily injury/property damage).  
- Excluding intangible losses (e.g., data loss) and omitting references to consequential damages.  
- Aligning with typical indemnification frameworks where indirect damages are waived unless expressly included.  

For clarity, a party seeking to **explicitly exclude indirect damages** from indemnification might add language like:  
*""Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be liable under this indemnification for any consequential, incidental, or indirect damages, except to the extent payable to a third party under a claim covered herein.""*

Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The query asks about an **""indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver.""** The provided clause (Section 14.4) is a broad indemnification provision that requires the franchisee (""You"") to indemnify the franchisor and related parties (""Indemnitees"") for losses arising from the franchisee's operations, including indirect damages (e.g., reputational harm, punitive damages). Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Indemnification Scope**:  
   - The clause covers **indirect damages** (e.g., ""compensation for damages to reputation and goodwill,"" ""punitive damages""), which are typically excluded in liability waivers.  
   - It explicitly includes losses arising ""directly or indirectly"" from the franchisee’s actions, suggesting no waiver for indirect damages.

2. **Carveout for Gross Negligence**:  
   - The indemnity **does not apply to liability arising from the Indemnitees’ gross negligence** (unless joint liability is involved). This is a **carveout** limiting the indemnification obligation.  
   - However, the clause still requires indemnification for the franchisee’s comparative negligence, even if the Indemnitees are partially at fault.

3. **No Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - Unlike a typical ""indirect damage waiver"" (where parties agree to exclude consequential/incidental damages), this clause **affirmatively includes indirect damages** in the indemnifiable losses.  
   - The broad definition of ""losses and expenses"" (covering punitive damages, reputational harm, etc.) reinforces this.

4. **External Context**:  
   - The external references (e.g., MAUD clauses) discuss termination fees and equitable remedies but don’t directly address indemnification. However, they highlight the agreement’s focus on **enforcing obligations** (e.g., specific performance), which aligns with the indemnification clause’s intent to protect the franchisor.

### Conclusion:  
The clause is **not a waiver of indirect damages** but rather an **expansive indemnification provision** that includes indirect damages unless gross negligence by the Indemnitees is proven. The ""carveout"" here is the exception for gross negligence, not an exclusion of indirect damages. If the query seeks to limit indemnification for indirect damages, this clause would need to be revised to explicitly exclude them (e.g., ""excluding consequential, incidental, or punitive damages"").

IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided is a **limitation of liability provision** that includes an **exception for intellectual property (IP) infringement claims**. Here’s how it relates to your query about an **IP infringement exception to an indirect damage waiver**:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause states that **neither party will be liable** for:  
     - Special damages  
     - Indirect damages  
     - Consequential damages  
     - Punitive damages  
     - Incidental damages  
   - This is a broad waiver protecting both parties from certain types of financial exposure.

2. **Exception for IP Infringement Claims**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** to claims or liabilities arising from **third-party IP infringement**.  
   - This means that if one party is sued by a third party for IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations), the **waiver of indirect/consequential damages does not apply**, and the infringing party could still be held liable for such damages.  

### Relevance to Your Query:
- The clause **carves out IP infringement** from the general exclusion of indirect/consequential damages.  
- This is significant because IP disputes often involve **high-stakes financial exposure** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or statutory damages).  
- The exception ensures that if a party’s actions (e.g., unauthorized use of third-party IP) trigger a lawsuit, the other party retains the right to seek **full remedies**, including indirect damages that would otherwise be waived.  

### Connection to External References:
The external references (e.g., **specific performance clauses**) reinforce that:  
- Courts may grant **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for IP breaches, even if monetary damages are inadequate.  
- The **right to enforce IP protections** is often treated as a **critical contractual right**, justifying exceptions to liability limitations.  

### Practical Implications:
- If a party is accused of IP infringement, the **waiver of indirect damages won’t protect them**—they could still face claims for lost profits, reputational harm, or other consequential losses.  
- This aligns with the broader legal principle that **IP rights are heavily safeguarded**, and contractual limitations on liability are often **narrowly construed** in this context.

Except in connection with a breach by either party of Article 7 or Section 8.1.5 [REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES] (v) and the indemnification obligations of Impresse under Section 9.4(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY IMPRESSE] and the indemnification obligations of VerticalNet under Section 9.5(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET], neither party will be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages arising out of or related to this Agreement, however caused and under any theory of liability (including negligence), even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.","The query asks about an **IP infringement exception to an indirect damage waiver** in a contract. The provided clause (**Section 9.3: Limitation of Liability**) is relevant because it broadly waives liability for **indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages**—**except** in specific scenarios. Here’s how it connects to the query:

### Key Points:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause states that neither party is liable for indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) **unless** an exception applies. This creates a baseline protection against claims for indirect losses.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   The waiver **does not apply** to:  
   - Breaches of **Article 7** (likely covering confidentiality, IP, or other critical obligations).  
   - Breaches of **Section 8.1.5(v)** (a specific representation/warranty, possibly related to IP).  
   - Indemnification obligations for IP infringement under **Sections 9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d)** (explicitly tied to indemnity for third-party IP claims).  

3. **Relevance to IP Infringement**:  
   - If IP infringement occurs (e.g., a party violates warranties about IP ownership or indemnifies for third-party claims), the **waiver of indirect damages does not apply**.  
   - This means the harmed party could still claim **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits from IP disputes) arising from the infringement, despite the general limitation of liability.  

4. **Connection to External Context**:  
   The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **9.10**) emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches, reinforcing that certain breaches (like IP violations) are treated as irreparable harm. This aligns with the exception in **Section 9.3**, where IP-related breaches bypass the indirect damages waiver.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause carves out **IP infringement** (and related breaches/indemnities) from the general waiver of indirect damages. Thus, if IP infringement occurs, the non-breaching party may pursue **full damages**, including indirect or consequential losses, even if the contract otherwise limits such liability.  

**Practical Implication**:  
- A party sued for IP infringement by a third party could face liability for indirect damages (e.g., downstream business losses) despite the broad waiver.  
- The exception ensures IP protections remain enforceable, as monetary damages alone may not suffice (per the external clauses on irreparable harm).

Here’s how the clause (**Article X**) and the external context are relevant:

### Key Points from **Article X (Waiver of Certain Damages)**:
1. **Broad Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly waives liability for consequential, indirect, special, punitive, or lost-profit damages arising from breaches of the agreement.  
   - This waiver applies even in cases of negligence or fault by the party whose liability is waived.  

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**:  
   - The waiver **does not limit** a party’s obligation to indemnify the other party against **third-party claims**, including claims for indirect/consequential damages (e.g., IP infringement claims by unaffiliated third parties).  
   - This means if a third party sues for IP infringement and seeks consequential damages (e.g., lost profits due to infringement), the indemnifying party must still cover those damages despite the general waiver.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- **IP Infringement as a Third-Party Claim**:  
  IP infringement claims typically arise from third parties (e.g., patent holders), so the exception in Article X preserves the right to recover indirect damages **in such cases**. The clause ensures that the waiver of indirect damages between the contracting parties does not shield a party from liability for third-party IP claims.  

- **Alignment with External Context**:  
  The provided external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 9.10**) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not override the indemnification carve-out in Article X. They reinforce that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches (like IP violations), but Article X’s exception ensures third-party IP claims are still covered.  

### Conclusion:
The clause **explicitly excludes third-party claims (including IP infringement) from the waiver of indirect damages**, meaning a party remains liable for indirect damages sought by third parties in IP disputes. This aligns with the query’s focus on exceptions to the waiver.  

**Practical Implication**:  
If Party A’s actions lead to a third-party IP lawsuit against Party B, Party A must indemnify Party B for the third party’s consequential damages (e.g., lost profits), even though Party B could not claim such damages directly from Party A under the agreement.",5

1. **Explicit Exception for IP Infringement Liability**  
   - The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, goodwill) under most circumstances.  
   - However, it **carves out an exception** for liability arising from **Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)**. This means that if a party breaches IP-related obligations (e.g., infringing a third party's IP), the waiver of indirect/consequential damages **does not apply**. The aggrieved party may still claim such damages for IP-related breaches.

2. **Cap on Liability with IP Infringement Exception**  
   - The clause also limits a party’s total liability under the agreement to the amount earned under **Section 5.4 (Revenue Sharing)** in the preceding 12 months.  
   - Again, this cap **does not apply to IP infringement claims** under Section 9.3. Thus, liability for IP infringement could exceed the revenue-sharing cap.  

### Connection to External Context  
The external references (e.g., **specific performance** clauses) highlight that parties often preserve equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate—particularly in IP cases, where infringement can cause irreparable harm. Here, **Section 9.4** aligns with this principle by:  
- Ensuring IP infringement claims remain actionable for **full damages** (including indirect/consequential types), unlike other breaches.  
- Reinforcing that IP breaches may warrant remedies beyond standard liability limits.  

### Key Takeaway  
The clause explicitly **excludes IP infringement from liability waivers and caps**, recognizing that such breaches may justify broader damages or equitable relief (consistent with the external context on irreparable harm). This exception ensures IP rights are enforceable without the constraints applied to other contractual breaches.",5

Here’s how the clause is relevant:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Equitable Relief for IP Breaches (Section 9.1)**  
   - The clause explicitly allows either party to seek **injunctive relief** (an equitable remedy) for breaches of obligations under **Article 13** (likely covering IP-related obligations) *before* formal dispute resolution.  
   - This suggests that IP breaches may trigger exceptions to the general liability limitations, as equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are preserved even where monetary damages are waived.

2. **Broad Waiver of Indirect/Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages** (including lost profits or economic harm) arising from *any* breach, including warranties or performance failures.  
   - However, this exclusion is **silent on IP infringement claims**, leaving ambiguity. Courts often treat IP claims (e.g., misappropriation, patent infringement) as distinct from contractual breaches, potentially allowing such claims to bypass the waiver.

3. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
   - Parties waive tort-based claims (e.g., negligence, misrepresentation) for **economic losses**, but carve out **personal injury or tangible property damage**.  
   - IP infringement claims (e.g., copyright or trademark violations) are typically torts, but the waiver’s focus on *economic losses* may not bar claims for IP-specific remedies (e.g., statutory damages, disgorgement of profits).

4. **Liquidated Damages and Essential Terms (Sections 9.6–9.7)**  
   - The parties affirm that liability limitations are **material to the agreement**, but this does not override statutory or equitable IP remedies that may exist outside the contract.

### Relevance to the Query:
- **Potential Exception for IP Infringement**:  
  While the clause waives most indirect damages, IP infringement claims might still be actionable because:  
  - Equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) is expressly preserved for breaches of **Article 13** (likely IP provisions).  
  - Tort waivers in Section 9.5 may not cover statutory IP remedies or intentional misconduct (e.g., willful infringement).  
  - External context (e.g., the provided **Sections 8.5 and 10.12**) underscores that equitable relief is available for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate—a common scenario in IP cases.

- **Uncertainty**:  
  The clause does not **explicitly** exclude IP infringement from the waiver, so enforceability may depend on jurisdiction and whether courts view IP claims as inherently non-waivable (e.g., under public policy).

### Conclusion:  
The clause **limits liability for indirect damages generally** but likely **preserves IP-related remedies** (especially injunctive relief and possibly statutory damages) due to:  
1. The carve-out for equitable relief in Section 9.1.  
2. The tort waiver’s narrow focus on *economic losses*.  
3. External precedent favoring specific enforcement for breaches harming IP rights.  

For certainty, the agreement should clarify whether IP infringement is exempt from the damages waiver. If Article 13 governs IP, its terms would control alongside this clause.",5
third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about a **""third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver""** because it explicitly carves out an exception to the general waiver of liability for indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Elements of the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause states that **neither party will be liable** for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. This is a common limitation of liability provision in contracts, shielding parties from unpredictable or disproportionate financial risks.

2. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** to claims or liabilities arising from **infringement of third-party intellectual property (IP) rights**.  
   - This means that if one party’s actions (e.g., use of licensed technology) infringe a third party’s IP, the other party **can still seek recovery** for indirect or consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or downstream losses) resulting from that infringement.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The query focuses on whether third-party IP infringement is treated differently from other types of breaches under the contract’s damage waiver.  
- The clause confirms that **third-party IP claims are excluded from the limitation on indirect damages**, allowing the aggrieved party to pursue broader remedies (e.g., equitable relief, as hinted at in the external information about specific performance).  
- This exception is critical because IP infringement often leads to significant indirect harms (e.g., business disruption, legal costs, or loss of market share), which the parties agree should not be capped or waived.

### Connection to External Information:
The external excerpts discuss **specific performance** and equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, emphasizing that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches. While those sections don’t directly address IP infringement, they reinforce that:  
- Some breaches (like IP infringement) may justify remedies beyond monetary compensation.  
- The clause’s exception aligns with the broader contractual intent to preserve robust enforcement mechanisms for high-stakes breaches (e.g., IP violations).

### Practical Implications:
- **For the IP-owning party**: They retain the right to claim full damages (including indirect/consequential) if the other party’s actions trigger third-party IP litigation.  
- **For the licensee/obligor**: They assume greater risk for IP-related breaches, as standard liability caps won’t apply.  

In summary, the clause explicitly **prioritizes IP protection over contractual damage waivers**, addressing the query by confirming that third-party IP infringement is treated as a distinct and carve-out scenario.",5

The provided clause (**Section 9.3 Limitation of Liability**) is relevant because it outlines the general waiver of liability for **indirect, consequential, or incidental damages**—but it also includes **exceptions** where such damages may still be claimed.  

### Key Relevance to the Query:  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause states that neither party is liable for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages **unless** an exception applies.  

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   The clause lists specific scenarios where the waiver **does not apply**, including:  
   - Breaches of **Article 7** (potentially covering IP-related obligations, depending on the agreement’s structure).  
   - Breaches of **Section 8.1.5** (representations and warranties, which may include IP warranties).  
   - Indemnification obligations under **Sections 9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d)** (which could cover third-party IP infringement claims).  

3. **Implication for Third-Party IP Infringement**:  
   If a third-party IP infringement claim triggers one of these exceptions (e.g., if it involves a breach of a warranty or indemnification obligation), then the **waiver of indirect damages would not apply**, meaning the affected party could still claim such damages.  

### Supporting Context from External Information:  
The external clauses (**Section 8.5 and Section 9.10**) emphasize that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are available for breaches, reinforcing that certain breaches (like IP-related ones) may bypass standard liability limitations.  

### Conclusion:  
The **Limitation of Liability** clause is relevant because it:  
- Generally excludes indirect damages **but**  
- **Carves out exceptions** that likely apply to third-party IP infringement claims (via indemnification or breach of warranties).  

Thus, if a third-party IP claim falls under one of the exceptions (e.g., indemnification obligations), the waiver of indirect damages would **not** protect the breaching party.

1. **Exception for IP Infringement Liability**  
   - The clause explicitly carves out an exception for liability arising from **Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement)**.  
   - This means that while the parties generally waive liability for **indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages** (as stated in the first paragraph), this waiver **does not apply** to claims related to third-party IP infringement.  
   - If a third party sues for IP infringement (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark violations), the liable party **can still be held responsible** for indirect or consequential damages resulting from such infringement.  

2. **General Limitation on Liability vs. IP Exception**  
   - The second paragraph caps liability at the amount earned under **Section 5.4 (Revenue Sharing)** in the preceding 12 months—**except for IP infringement claims under Section 9.3**.  
   - Thus, IP infringement claims are **not subject to this monetary cap**, meaning the liable party could face **uncapped damages** (including indirect/consequential damages) if sued for IP violations.  

3. **Connection to External References (Specific Performance & Equitable Relief)**  
   - The external references (e.g., **Section 8.5** and **Section 9.10**) discuss **specific performance and injunctive relief** for breaches, reinforcing that certain breaches (like IP infringement) may justify remedies beyond monetary damages.  
   - Since IP infringement often involves **irreparable harm** (e.g., loss of exclusivity, brand damage), courts may allow claims for **equitable relief** (injunctions) alongside uncapped damages, aligning with the exception in **Section 9.4**.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause ensures that while most indirect damages are waived, **IP infringement claims remain fully actionable**, including for consequential damages and without the usual liability cap. This exception protects the non-breaching party from bearing undue risk when third-party IP rights are violated.

Here's how the clause addresses this:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause broadly waives liability for **consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages** (including lost profits) arising from breaches of the agreement, even in cases of negligence or fault.  

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**:  
   The waiver **explicitly excludes** indemnification obligations for claims brought by **unaffiliated third parties**. Specifically, it states:  
   > *""the foregoing shall not be construed as limiting an obligation of a party hereunder to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties, including... third-party claims for special, indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages.""*  

   This means:  
   - If a third party (e.g., an IP owner) sues for infringement, the waiving party may still be required to **indemnify** the other party for those claims, even if they involve indirect/consequential damages (e.g., lost profits due to IP litigation).  
   - The exception preserves the right to recover damages that would otherwise be waived under the agreement if the claim originates from a third party.  

3. **Relevance to IP Infringement**:  
   - Third-party IP claims (e.g., patent, copyright, or trademark infringement) often seek **indirect damages** (e.g., lost revenues from enjoined sales).  
   - The clause ensures that such third-party claims **are not barred** by the general waiver of indirect damages between the contracting parties.  

### Connection to External References:  
The external clauses (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 9.10*) emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches but do not conflict with the indemnification carve-out for third-party claims in Article X. They reinforce that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches, but the indemnification exception in Article X operates independently to address third-party liabilities.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **explicitly carves out third-party claims** (including IP infringement) from the indirect damages waiver, ensuring indemnification rights remain intact. This aligns with the query’s focus on exceptions to the waiver for third-party IP disputes.  

**Practical Implication**: If a third party sues for IP infringement, the indemnifying party could still be liable for the claimant’s indirect damages (e.g., lost profits), despite the general waiver between the contracting parties.",5
third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The query asks about a **""third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver""** in the context of a limitation of liability clause. Here’s how **Clause 13.4** is relevant:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, and similar damages** (e.g., lost profits) arising from breaches of the agreement, except for:
     - Breaches of confidentiality (Section 11).
     - Indemnification obligations (which typically cover third-party claims).
     - Where prohibited by law.

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**:  
   - The carve-out at the end states that the waiver **does not apply** if:  
     - A third party (e.g., through a lawsuit) successfully claims such damages (e.g., **indirect/consequential damages awarded to a third party**).  
     - This would include scenarios like **third-party IP infringement claims** where the aggrieved third party seeks damages (e.g., lost profits due to IP violation).  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **preserves liability for indirect damages** when they arise from **third-party claims**, even though the parties otherwise waive such damages between themselves.  
- In an **IP infringement case**, if a third party (e.g., a patent holder) sues one party and wins **consequential damages** (e.g., lost royalties), the liable party **cannot invoke the waiver in Clause 13.4** to avoid compensating the other party for those costs (e.g., via indemnification).  
- This aligns with the external references (e.g., **specific performance** clauses), which emphasize that certain breaches (like IP infringement) warrant remedies beyond monetary damages, including equitable relief or indemnification for third-party liabilities.  

### Practical Implication:
The clause ensures that while the parties limit liability for indirect losses **between themselves**, they remain accountable for **third-party claims** (e.g., IP infringement suits) that result in such damages. This exception protects the non-breaching party from bearing the burden of external judgments.

"indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third party IP infringement and fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct",a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The provided clause is relevant to the query in the following ways:  

1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages** – The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for ""special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages,"" which aligns with the query's focus on **indirect damage waiver clauses**.  

2. **Exclusion of Third-Party IP Infringement** – The clause carves out an exception for claims arising from **third-party intellectual property infringement**, meaning that liability for such claims (including indirect damages) is **not waived**. This directly addresses the query's requirement regarding exclusions for third-party IP infringement.  

3. **No Mention of Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct** – While the clause does not explicitly exclude fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, its silence on these matters implies that such claims **may still be pursued** (unless another clause in the agreement addresses them). If the query seeks a waiver that **explicitly excludes** these exceptions, this clause would need to be supplemented with additional language.  

### Comparison with External References:  
The external references discuss **specific performance** and **irreparable harm**, emphasizing that monetary damages may not suffice for breaches. While they do not directly address indirect damage waivers, they reinforce that certain breaches (e.g., IP infringement, fraud, or willful misconduct) may warrant **equitable remedies** beyond standard liability limitations.  

### Suggested Refinement (if needed):  
If the query requires an **explicit exclusion** for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the clause could be expanded as follows:  
> *""Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from (a) an infringement of any third-party intellectual property right, (b) fraud, (c) gross negligence, or (d) willful misconduct, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages of any kind.""*  

This would fully align with the query's requirements.  

**Final Takeaway:**  
The given clause partially satisfies the query by waiving indirect damages **except for third-party IP claims**, but it does not explicitly address fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. Depending on the contract’s broader context, additional language may be needed.",4

ARTICLE 10","The **Limitation of Liability clause (9.5)** is directly relevant to the query regarding **indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** in the following ways:

### **1. Exclusion of Indirect Damages**  
The clause broadly limits liability for **indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or speculative damages**, unless an exception applies. This aligns with the query’s focus on waiving indirect damages.

### **2. Exceptions for Fraud & IP/Confidentiality Breaches**  
The clause **carves out exceptions** where liability still applies, including:  
- **Fraud** by a party (explicitly mentioned in the query).  
- Breaches of **Article 7 (Intellectual Property)**, which covers **third-party IP infringement claims** (relevant to the query’s exclusion of third-party IP liability).  
- Breaches of **Article 10 (Confidentiality)**, which may relate to misconduct or negligence in handling sensitive information.  

This means that while indirect damages are generally waived, **fraud, IP infringement, and confidentiality breaches remain fully actionable**.

### **3. Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**  
The clause clarifies that **indemnifiable third-party claims** (e.g., IP infringement suits) are **not subject to the liability cap**, meaning a party can still be held liable for damages paid to third parties. This addresses the query’s concern about **third-party IP infringement exclusions**.

### **4. No Explicit Mention of Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct**  
While the clause excludes **fraud**, it does **not explicitly mention gross negligence or willful misconduct**. This could imply that such claims might still be subject to the limitation of liability unless another provision (or applicable law) overrides it.  

### **Comparison with External References**  
The external clauses (e.g., **Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction**) emphasize **equitable remedies (injunctions, specific performance)** for breaches but do not conflict with the liability waiver in **Section 9.5**. They reinforce that **monetary damages may be inadequate** for certain breaches (like IP or fraud), which aligns with the exceptions in the liability clause.

### **Conclusion**  
This **Limitation of Liability** clause is **highly relevant** to the query because:  
- It **waives indirect damages** broadly.  
- It **excludes fraud, third-party IP claims, and confidentiality breaches** from the waiver.  
- It **does not explicitly exclude gross negligence/willful misconduct**, leaving room for interpretation.  

For a complete analysis, you may need to cross-reference with:  
- Definitions of **""fraud""** and **""willful misconduct""** in the agreement.  
- Any **indemnification provisions** related to third-party IP claims.  
- Governing law (e.g., Delaware law may influence enforceability of exclusions).

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE NON-BREACHING PARTY BE ENTITLED TO EQUITABLE OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OF ANY KIND.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query regarding **indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**. Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly waives liability for **special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits, lost revenue) arising from the agreement, except in specific carve-out scenarios.  
   - This aligns with the query’s focus on **indirect damage waivers**.

2. **Carve-Outs for Gross Negligence, Willful Misconduct, and Fraud**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** to cases involving:  
     - **Gross negligence**  
     - **Willful misconduct**  
     - **Fraud**  
   - These exceptions match the query’s requirement to exclude such conduct from the waiver.  

3. **Additional Exceptions (Relevant to IP and Other Breaches)**:  
   - The clause also preserves liability for:  
     - **Indemnification claims under Section 5** (which may cover third-party IP infringement, though not explicitly stated here).  
     - **Breaches of Sections 2 (Trademarks), 8 (Confidentiality), or 9 (No Agency Relationship)**.  
   - This indirectly addresses **third-party IP infringement** (via trademark breaches) and other material breaches.  

4. **Waiver of Equitable/Injunctive Relief**:  
   - The clause states that the **non-breaching party is not entitled to equitable or injunctive relief**, except for the carve-outs listed (e.g., fraud, gross negligence, or breaches of specific sections).  
   - This contrasts with the **external information** provided (e.g., *Maud_102* and *Maud_417*), where equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) is explicitly preserved for breaches. Here, it is broadly waived unless an exception applies.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- The clause **explicitly excludes liability for indirect damages** (as queried) but **carves out fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** (also as queried).  
- While it does not explicitly mention **third-party IP infringement**, it covers related issues (e.g., trademark breaches) and indemnification claims, which may encompass IP disputes.  
- The **waiver of injunctive relief** is notable, as it diverges from the external examples where equitable remedies are preserved.  

### Suggested Refinements (if needed):  
If the query seeks **explicit inclusion of third-party IP infringement** in the carve-outs, the clause could be amended to:  
- Add **""third-party IP infringement""** to the list of exceptions (e.g., alongside fraud/gross negligence).  
- Clarify whether **indemnification under Section 5** covers IP claims.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause satisfies the core requirements of the query by:  
1. Waiving indirect damages.  
2. Excluding fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from the waiver.  
3. Implicitly addressing IP/trademark issues through breach exceptions.  

It differs from the external examples by broadly **limiting equitable relief**, which may be intentional based on the parties’ risk allocation.",5
"indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third party IP infringement and fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct",5da8e756e1,"9.3. Limitation of Liability. Except in connection with a breach by either party of Article 7 or Section 8.1.5 [REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES] (v) and the indemnification obligations of Impresse under Section 9.4(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY IMPRESSE] and the indemnification obligations of VerticalNet under Section 9.5(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET], neither party will be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages arising out of or related to this Agreement, however caused and under any theory of liability (including negligence), even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.","The **Limitation of Liability clause (9.3)** is relevant to the query regarding **indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** in the following ways:

### **1. Exclusion of Indirect/Consequential Damages**  
The clause broadly excludes liability for:  
- **Special, indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages**  
- **Damages arising under any theory of liability (including negligence)**  

This means that neither party can claim compensation for **indirect losses** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, business interruption) unless an **explicit exception applies**.

### **2. Exceptions to the Waiver (Where Liability Still Applies)**  
The clause **does not** exclude liability in cases involving:  
- **Breach of Article 7 or Section 8.1.5** (likely covering fundamental obligations like confidentiality, compliance, or material representations)  
- **Indemnification obligations** (e.g., third-party IP infringement claims under **Section 9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d)**)

This means:  
- **Third-party IP infringement claims** (a key concern in the query) are **not waived**—they fall under indemnification.  
- **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are **not explicitly mentioned**, but if they relate to a breach of Article 7 or Section 8.1.5, they may still incur liability.  

### **3. Comparison with External References**  
The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5 and 9.10**) emphasize **specific performance and injunctive relief** for breaches, reinforcing that monetary damages alone may not suffice. However, **Section 9.3** focuses on **limiting indirect damages**, not overriding fraud/gross negligence claims if they breach core terms.

### **Key Takeaway**  
This clause **waives indirect damages** but **preserves liability for**:  
- **Third-party IP claims** (via indemnification)  
- **Breaches of key contractual terms** (which could include fraud/gross negligence if tied to Article 7 or Section 8.1.5)  

If **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** are not explicitly carved out, they might still be actionable under general law or if they breach surviving obligations. For stronger exclusions, an **explicit carve-out** (e.g., ""except for fraud, willful misconduct, or third-party IP claims"") would be advisable.  

Would you like me to draft a revised clause with such carve-outs?",5

27.1 In any case the above provisions have not to be interpreted as an exclusion or a limitation of the responsibility in the case of gross negligence or wilful
misconduct or for damages deriving from fraud, death or personal injuries caused by negligence of wilful misconduct or any other liability to the extent
such liability may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.
27.2 Indirect Damages. In no event will either PARTY be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages in any way related to a relevant
PURCHASE ORDER, even if the damages are foreseeable or the possibility of the damages has been communicated.
27.3 Acknowledged Direct Damages. Any damages resulting from breach of confidentiality, privacy or data security obligations pursuant to an applicable
PURCHASE ORDER or these Ts&Cs are acknowledged to be direct damages and neither party will assert these damages are special, indirect or
consequential.
27.4 VF’S Limitation of Liability. Except for VF’s indemnification obligations or breach of confidentiality obligations, in no event will THE COMPANY, or
any of its AFFILIATES, be liable to SUPPLIER for damages arising under an applicable PURCHASE ORDER or these Ts&Cs for any cause whatsoever

Here’s how the clause addresses these elements:

### 1. **Exclusion of Liability for Gross Negligence, Willful Misconduct, and Fraud**  
   - **Section 27.1** explicitly states that the limitations of liability do **not** apply to cases involving:  
     - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct**  
     - **Fraud**  
     - **Death or personal injury caused by negligence or willful misconduct**  
     - **Any liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law**  
   - This aligns with the query’s requirement that such exclusions must be carved out from general liability waivers.

### 2. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - **Section 27.2** disclaims liability for **special, indirect, or consequential damages**, even if foreseeable.  
   - However, **Section 27.3** clarifies that breaches of **confidentiality, privacy, or data security obligations** are treated as **direct damages**, not indirect/consequential.  
   - This distinction ensures that while indirect damages are generally waived, certain breaches (like IP/data-related ones) remain actionable.

### 3. **Third-Party IP Infringement (Indemnification Exceptions)**  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention **third-party IP infringement**, **Section 27.5** retains liability for **Supplier’s indemnification obligations**, which typically cover third-party claims (including IP infringement).  
   - This means that while indirect damages are waived, indemnification for third-party IP claims is preserved.

### 4. **Fraud and Intentional Misconduct**  
   - **Section 27.1** excludes fraud from liability limitations.  
   - **Section 27.5** also holds the Supplier liable for **intentional misconduct**, reinforcing that such conduct is not shielded by the waiver.

### **Relevance to Query**  
The clause effectively:  
- **Waives indirect/consequential damages** (Section 27.2).  
- **Excludes fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** from liability limitations (Section 27.1).  
- **Preserves indemnification obligations** (implied for third-party IP claims in Section 27.5).  
- **Treats confidentiality/data breaches as direct damages** (Section 27.3), ensuring they are not waived.  

Thus, it meets the query’s requirements by **excluding high-risk conduct (fraud, negligence) and third-party claims (via indemnification) while broadly waiving indirect damages**.  

**External Context (Specific Performance Clause):**  
The referenced *Specific Performance* clause (7.11) underscores that breaches may warrant injunctive relief, but it does not directly interact with the liability limitations. The **Limitation of Liability** clause remains the primary mechanism for addressing the query’s concerns.

### 1. **Scope of Waiver**  
The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, and other non-direct damages** (e.g., lost profits) arising from breaches of the agreement. However, it explicitly **excludes third-party claims** from this waiver, meaning:  
   - If an unaffiliated third party (e.g., a customer, bystander) sues for personal/bodily injury, the waiver does **not** shield a party from indemnifying the other party against such claims.  
   - This creates an implicit exception for third-party claims involving bodily injury, even if those claims seek indirect or consequential damages (e.g., medical costs, pain and suffering).  

### 2. **No Explicit Exclusion for Personal/Bodily Injury**  
While the clause does not **explicitly** mention ""personal injury"" or ""bodily injury,"" its carve-out for third-party claims ensures that liability for such injuries (if asserted by third parties) is preserved. This aligns with common legal interpretations where:  
   - Waivers of indirect damages typically exclude **personal injury claims** due to public policy considerations (e.g., negligence laws).  
   - The clause’s language (""claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties"") would encompass bodily injury claims by non-parties.  

### 3. **Contrast with Equitable Remedies**  
The external information (Sections 8.5 and 9.10) emphasizes **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches, but these remedies are distinct from damages. The waiver in Article X focuses on **monetary damages**, not injunctive relief. Thus:  
   - A party could still seek equitable remedies (e.g., an injunction) for breaches, even if monetary damages for indirect harms are waived.  
   - Bodily injury claims by third parties would likely fall outside this waiver, as they are not ""equitable"" but rather tort-based.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause **waives indirect damages between the contracting parties** but **preserves liability for third-party claims**, which would include personal/bodily injury claims. While not explicitly stated, the structure implies that bodily injury is **not** subject to the waiver when asserted by third parties. For direct claims between the parties, however, the waiver might apply unless another provision (e.g., an indemnity clause) overrides it.

9.2. Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages. Independent of, severable from, and to be enforced independently of any other provision of this Agreement, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (NOR TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS) IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KINDâ€”including lost profits, loss of business, or other economic damage, and further including injury to property, AS A RESULT OF BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED, HAD OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

9.5. Tort Claim Waiver. In addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this Article 9, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives any right to recover from the other party, and Customer waives any right to recover from any Eligible Provider, any economic losses or damages in any action brought under tort theories, including, misrepresentation, negligence and/or strict liability, and/or relating to the quality or performance of any products or services provided by Metavante. For purposes of this waiver, economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service except personal injury or damage to other tangible property. Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.
9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination. Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.
9.7. Essential Elements. Customer and Metavante acknowledge and agree that the limitations contained in this Article 9 are essential to this Agreement, and that Metavante has expressly relied upon the inclusion of each and every provision of this Article 9 as a condition to executing this Agreement.","The **""Limitation of Liability / Maximum Damages Allowed""** clause (Article 9) is highly relevant to the query about **personal or bodily injury exceptions to indirect damage waivers**. Here’s how:

### **1. Exclusion of Consequential & Indirect Damages (Section 9.2)**  
- The clause explicitly waives liability for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including economic losses (lost profits, business interruption) and **injury to property**.  
- However, it **does not explicitly exclude personal or bodily injury claims**. The phrase *""injury to property""* suggests a distinction between **property damage** and **personal injury**, implying that bodily injury may **not** be covered by this waiver.  

### **2. Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
- This section reinforces the waiver of **economic losses** in tort claims (negligence, misrepresentation, strict liability).  
- **Key Exception:** It explicitly **carves out personal injury** from the waiver:  
  > *""economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service **except personal injury or damage to other tangible property**.""*  
  - This means **personal/bodily injury claims are preserved** and not waived, even if economic damages are excluded.  

### **3. Equitable Relief (Section 9.1) & Liquidated Damages (Section 9.6)**  
- While these sections limit monetary remedies, they do **not** restrict claims for **personal injury**, as such claims typically fall under **tort law** rather than contractual damages.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **broadly excludes indirect and consequential damages** (including property damage) but **explicitly preserves the right to pursue personal/bodily injury claims** outside the contractual waiver. This aligns with common legal principles where personal injury is treated separately from economic losses in liability waivers.  

**Relevance to Query:**  
- If the query concerns whether a party can still sue for **personal injury** despite a waiver of indirect damages, the answer is **yes**, as Section 9.5 **explicitly excludes personal injury** from the tort claim waiver.  
- However, **purely economic or property-related damages** are barred under Sections 9.2 and 9.5.

In addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this Article 9, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives any right to recover from the other party, and Customer waives any right to recover from any Eligible Provider, any economic losses or damages in any action brought under tort theories, including, misrepresentation, negligence and/or strict liability, and/or relating to the quality or performance of any products or services provided by Metavante. For purposes of this waiver, economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service except personal injury or damage to other tangible property. Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.
9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination. Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.
9.7. Essential Elements. Customer and Metavante acknowledge and agree that the limitations contained in this Article 9 are essential to this Agreement, and that Metavante has expressly relied upon the inclusion of each and every provision of this Article 9 as a condition to executing this Agreement.","The **""Limitation of Liability/Maximum Damages Allowed""** clause (Article 9) is highly relevant to the query about **personal or bodily injury exceptions to indirect damage waivers**. Here’s how the clause addresses the issue:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **Exclusion of Consequential/Indirect Damages (Section 9.2)**  
   - The clause explicitly waives liability for **incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages**, including economic losses (e.g., lost profits) and **injury to property**.  
   - However, it **does not explicitly exclude claims for personal or bodily injury**. This omission suggests that such claims may **not** be covered by the waiver of indirect damages, leaving the door open for tort-based claims (e.g., negligence) related to physical harm.

2. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**  
   - The parties waive the right to recover **economic losses** under tort theories (e.g., negligence, strict liability).  
   - **Exception for Personal Injury**: The waiver explicitly carves out **""personal injury or damage to other tangible property""** from the scope of waived tort claims. This means:  
     - Claims for **bodily injury** are **not barred** by the tort waiver.  
     - The clause preserves the right to sue for personal injury even if economic damages (e.g., lost income due to injury) are otherwise excluded.  

3. **Equitable Relief (Section 9.1)**  
   - While the clause allows injunctive relief for breaches (e.g., to stop harmful conduct), it does not limit remedies for personal injury, which typically fall under tort law.  

4. **Statute of Limitations (Section 9.4)**  
   - The 2-year limitation applies to contractual and tort claims **except** for personal injury, which may have a different statutory timeframe under applicable law (e.g., longer limits for bodily injury claims in many jurisdictions).  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **explicitly excludes personal injury** from the waiver of tort claims and indirect damages, meaning:  
- **Economic losses** (e.g., lost profits) are waived, even in tort claims.  
- **Personal/bodily injury claims** are **preserved** and not subject to the contractual limitations on liability.  

This aligns with common legal principles where parties cannot contractually waive liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or bodily injury in many jurisdictions. The external references (e.g., irreparable harm and equitable relief) further support that contractual waivers typically focus on economic harms, not physical injury.  

**Practical Implication:** If a party suffers bodily injury due to the other party’s actions, they may still pursue a tort claim despite the broad waiver of indirect damages in the agreement.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to indirect damage waiver,e7eebca907,"27. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
27.1 In any case the above provisions have not to be interpreted as an exclusion or a limitation of the responsibility in the case of gross negligence or wilful
misconduct or for damages deriving from fraud, death or personal injuries caused by negligence of wilful misconduct or any other liability to the extent
such liability may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.
27.2 Indirect Damages. In no event will either PARTY be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages in any way related to a relevant
PURCHASE ORDER, even if the damages are foreseeable or the possibility of the damages has been communicated.
27.3 Acknowledged Direct Damages. Any damages resulting from breach of confidentiality, privacy or data security obligations pursuant to an applicable
PURCHASE ORDER or these Ts&Cs are acknowledged to be direct damages and neither party will assert these damages are special, indirect or
consequential.
27.4 VF’S Limitation of Liability. Except for VF’s indemnification obligations or breach of confidentiality obligations, in no event will THE COMPANY, or
any of its AFFILIATES, be liable to SUPPLIER for damages arising under an applicable PURCHASE ORDER or these Ts&Cs for any cause whatsoever
regardless of the form or the action or the theory of recovery in an amount in excess of the amount paid or payable to SUPPLIER under the applicable
PURCHASE ORDER.
27.5 SUPPLIER’s Limitation of Liability. Except for SUPPLIER’s indemnification obligations, supplier’s breach of confidentiality obligations, supplier’s breach of data security obligations or supplier’s gross negligence or intentional misconduct, any direct damages for which SUPPLIER may become liable to VF with respect to an applicable PURCHASE ORDER or these Ts&Cs, for any cause whatsoever regardless of the form or the action or the theory of recovery will be limited in the aggregate to the greater of (a) three (3) times the total amount of fees payable to SUPPLIER under the relevant PURCHASE ORDER or (b) the amount of coverages required under the insurance provisions of the relevant PURCHASE ORDER and/or these Ts&Cs; (c) EUR 2,000,000 (two million euros)","The **""personal or bodily injury exception to indirect damage waiver""** is directly addressed in **Section 27.1** of the provided clause. Here’s how the clause is relevant to the query:

### Key Points:
1. **Exception for Personal/Bodily Injury**  
   - Section 27.1 explicitly states that the general limitations of liability **do not apply** to:  
     - **Death or personal injuries** caused by negligence or wilful misconduct.  
     - Any liability that **cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law** (e.g., statutory protections for bodily harm).  
   - This ensures that claims for physical harm (e.g., workplace accidents, product-related injuries) are **not barred** by the contract’s waiver of indirect/consequential damages.

2. **Indirect Damages Waiver (Section 27.2)**  
   - While the clause broadly excludes liability for indirect/consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm), this waiver **does not override** the carve-out in Section 27.1 for bodily injury.  
   - Personal injury claims are treated as **direct damages** (not indirect), even if they arise incidentally from a breach of contract.

3. **Alignment with Legal Standards**  
   - Many jurisdictions prohibit contractual waivers for liability involving personal injury or gross negligence (e.g., under tort law). Section 27.1 reflects this by preserving such claims.  
   - The clause ensures compliance with mandatory legal protections while still limiting other types of damages.

### Practical Implications:
- If a party suffers bodily injury due to the other party’s negligence (e.g., unsafe products/services), they can **still sue for compensation** despite the indirect damages waiver.  
- The exception is **narrow**: It applies only to physical harm (not emotional distress unless tied to bodily injury) and requires negligence/wilful misconduct.  

### External Context:  
The provided external excerpts (on specific performance) are unrelated to the query, as they address remedies for breach (e.g., injunctions) rather than liability limitations. The focus here is on **Section 27.1**’s carve-out for personal injury.  

In summary, the clause **explicitly excludes personal injury claims from the indirect damages waiver**, ensuring they remain actionable under applicable law.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to indirect damage waiver,0dd1d92b6d,"14. Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages. In any action or proceeding between the Parties (including any arbitration proceeding) arising under or with respect to this Agreement or in any manner pertaining to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or to the relationship of the Parties under this Agreement, each Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and releases any right, power or privilege either may have to claim or receive from the other Party any punitive or exemplary damages, each Party acknowledging and agreeing that the remedies herein provided and other remedies at law or in equity will in all circumstances be adequate. Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The **""Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages"" clause (Section 14)** is relevant to the query about **personal or bodily injury exceptions to indirect damage waivers** in the following ways:

1. **Scope of Waiver**:  
   - The clause explicitly waives claims for **punitive or exemplary damages** in disputes arising under the agreement.  
   - However, it does **not** explicitly mention **personal/bodily injury claims**, which are typically compensatory (direct damages) rather than punitive.  

2. **Implications for Indirect vs. Direct Damages**:  
   - The waiver applies to **non-compensatory damages** (e.g., punitive damages) but does not appear to exclude **compensatory damages** (e.g., medical costs, lost wages from bodily injury).  
   - If bodily injury claims are considered **direct damages**, they may **not** be waived by this clause, as the focus is on punitive/exemplary damages.  

3. **Contrast with External References**:  
   - The external clauses (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 9.10*) emphasize **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not address bodily injury.  
   - This suggests that **personal injury claims** might fall outside the scope of the waiver, as they are not ""non-compensatory"" and are typically governed by tort law, not contractual limitations.  

4. **Key Takeaway**:  
   - The clause likely **does not bar claims for bodily injury**, as such claims are compensatory and not punitive/exemplary.  
   - If the parties intended to exclude personal injury liability, the clause would need explicit language to that effect (e.g., ""waiver of all indirect, consequential, **or personal injury damages**"").  

### Conclusion:  
The waiver applies only to **non-compensatory damages** (punitive/exemplary), leaving **bodily injury claims** unaffected unless the agreement elsewhere explicitly limits them. Courts often scrutinize waivers of personal injury liability, so ambiguity here likely favors the injured party.

Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party is liable for **special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages** arising from the agreement, even if foreseeable or advised of the possibility.  
   - This waiver applies broadly to claims in contract, tort (including negligence), or statutory breach.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   The clause explicitly carves out **three scenarios** where the waiver does **not** apply:  
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: The waiver does not limit amounts payable to third parties under indemnities in **Article 10, Sections 16.1, or 16.2**.  
     - *Relevance to Confidentiality*: If confidentiality breaches trigger indemnification (e.g., under Article 10), liability for consequential damages may still apply.  
   - **Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct**: The waiver is invalidated if damages result from gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing.  
     - *Relevance to Confidentiality*: A party’s reckless or intentional breach of confidentiality (e.g., leaking sensitive data) could expose them to claims for indirect damages.  

3. **Connection to External Context**:  
   - The external excerpts (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 10.12**) emphasize that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are available for breaches, even if monetary damages are waived.  
   - This suggests that while indirect damages are generally waived, **confidentiality breaches** might still be actionable through **specific performance or injunctive relief**, or via indemnification if tied to third-party claims.

### Summary for the Query:  
The clause limits liability for indirect damages **unless**:  
1. The damages arise from **gross negligence/willful misconduct** (e.g., deliberate confidentiality breaches).  
2. The damages are owed to **third parties under indemnification** (e.g., if a confidentiality breach harms a third party, triggering indemnity under Article 10).  

Thus, confidentiality-related claims could **escape the waiver** if they fall under these exceptions. The clause balances broad liability protection with carve-outs for egregious conduct or third-party impacts.",5

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party can recover **special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages** arising from the agreement.  
   - This is a standard **indirect damage waiver**, limiting liability for secondary losses (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm).  

2. **Exception for Confidentiality Breaches**:  
   - The **""provided however""** carve-out explicitly preserves the right to claim **special, incidental, or consequential damages** if the other party breaches **Article 8 (Confidentiality)**.  
   - This means that while most indirect damages are waived, **confidentiality breaches remain an exception**, allowing the harmed party to seek full compensation for such violations.  

3. **Alignment with External Context (Specific Performance)**:  
   - The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *8.10* from MAUD) highlight that breaches of key terms (like confidentiality) may justify **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions)** because monetary damages alone might be inadequate.  
   - The clause reinforces this by ensuring that financial remedies for confidentiality breaches are **not limited**, even if other indirect damages are waived.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause **carves out confidentiality breaches from the general waiver of indirect damages**, ensuring that parties retain robust legal and financial recourse for violations of confidentiality obligations. This aligns with broader contract principles where confidentiality is often treated as a **high-priority obligation** warranting stronger protections.

Here’s how it relates to the query and the external context:

### 1. **Relevance to Confidentiality Exceptions**  
While the clause does not explicitly mention confidentiality, it could implicitly affect confidentiality breaches in two ways:  
   - **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**: If a breach of confidentiality causes indirect/consequential harm (e.g., lost profits due to leaked trade secrets), this clause would typically bar claims for such damages **between the parties**.  
   - **Exception for Third-Party Claims**: If a confidentiality breach leads to a third party suing for indirect damages (e.g., a customer suing for lost profits due to leaked data), the indemnification obligation in the clause would **preserve liability** for those third-party claims.  

### 2. **Interaction with External Context (Specific Performance)**  
The external clauses (Sections 8.5 and 9.10) emphasize **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate. This suggests:  
   - **Confidentiality breaches** (e.g., unauthorized disclosures) might qualify for injunctive relief, as monetary damages (even if waived under Article X) may not suffice to stop harm.  
   - **Tension with Article X**: While Article X waives indirect damages, equitable remedies could still apply to enforce confidentiality obligations, as the external clauses override pure monetary limitations.  

### 3. **Key Takeaway**  
The clause **limits liability for indirect damages** between the parties but:  
   - **Does not waive non-monetary remedies** (e.g., injunctions for confidentiality breaches).  
   - **Preserves liability for third-party claims**, which could include confidentiality-related damages asserted by outsiders.  

Thus, while the clause doesn’t directly address confidentiality, its exceptions and interplay with equitable remedies leave room for non-damages enforcement of confidentiality terms. For a full answer, review the agreement’s **confidentiality-specific provisions** alongside this waiver.",4

### **1. Exception for Breach of Confidentiality**  
The clause explicitly **carves out an exception** to the general waiver of liability for **indirect, consequential, and other non-direct damages** (e.g., lost profits, business opportunities) when the damages arise from:  
   - A **breach of confidentiality obligations (Article 12)**  
   - A **breach of indemnification obligations (Article 11)**  

This means that while the parties generally waive claims for indirect damages, they **retain the right to seek such damages if the other party violates confidentiality or indemnification terms**.

### **2. Relevance to the Query**  
The query asks about **confidentiality exceptions to an indirect damage waiver**, and this clause provides a clear answer:  
   - **Indirect damages (e.g., consequential, lost profits) are typically excluded** under the agreement.  
   - **However, if a party breaches confidentiality (Article 12), the waiver does not apply**, meaning the harmed party can still claim indirect damages resulting from that breach.  

### **3. Connection to External References**  
The external references (Sections 10.12 and 8.5) discuss **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance)** for breaches, reinforcing that certain breaches (like confidentiality) may justify **additional legal remedies beyond mere monetary damages**. While those sections focus on **enforcement mechanisms**, Section 11.5 clarifies **financial liability exceptions**, including for confidentiality breaches.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause confirms that:  
- **Indirect damages are generally waived** under the agreement.  
- **But if a party breaches confidentiality, the waiver does not apply**, allowing the harmed party to recover consequential or indirect damages resulting from that breach.

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or special damages**, including losses like profits, business interruption, or data loss, even if a party was aware such damages could occur.  

2. **Key Exceptions to the Waiver**  
   The waiver **does not apply** to:  
   - **Confidentiality obligations (Section 12)** – If a breach of confidentiality occurs, the injured party may still claim indirect or consequential damages arising from that breach.  
   - **Indemnification obligations (Section 13)** – Claims under indemnification provisions (e.g., third-party claims) are also exempt from this waiver, meaning liability for indirect damages may still apply in those cases.  

3. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - The clause confirms that while most indirect damages are waived, **confidentiality breaches remain an exception**, allowing a party to seek remedies (including equitable relief, as referenced in the external excerpts) for such breaches.  
   - The external information supports this by emphasizing that **irreparable harm from breaches (including confidentiality breaches)** may justify injunctive relief or other remedies beyond monetary damages.  

### Conclusion  
The clause **carves out confidentiality and indemnification obligations** from the general waiver of indirect damages, meaning a party can still pursue claims for consequential losses stemming from a breach of confidentiality or indemnifiable events. This aligns with the external excerpts, which highlight that equitable remedies (like injunctions) may be necessary where monetary damages are inadequate—particularly in cases involving breaches of key obligations like confidentiality.",5

Here’s how:

### **1. Carveout for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
- **Section 11.6** states that neither party is liable for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits) **except** in certain enumerated cases, including:  
  - **(E) Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**  
  - **(F) Indemnification obligations under Article 12**  
- Similarly, **Section 11.7** imposes an **aggregate liability cap** but **excludes** from that cap:  
  - **(V) Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**  
  - **(VI) Indemnification obligations under Article 12**  

This means that **if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the waiver of indirect/consequential damages (Section 11.6) and the liability cap (Section 11.7) do not apply**. The injured party can seek **full damages**, including consequential losses, and there is **no limit on liability** for such misconduct.

### **2. Connection to Indemnification (Article 12)**  
- **Article 12 (Indemnification)** reinforces this carveout by explicitly requiring each party to indemnify the other for **Losses** arising from:  
  - **Breach of contract**  
  - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct**  
- This means that **fraudulent or grossly negligent acts not only bypass the damage waiver but also trigger indemnification obligations**, ensuring the harmed party is fully compensated.  

### **3. Relevance to External Information (Enforcement & Equitable Relief)**  
The external references (e.g., **Section 10.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction**) highlight that:  
- **Irreparable harm** justifies **injunctive relief** (e.g., specific performance).  
- **Monetary damages may not suffice** for breaches, especially in cases of **fraud or willful misconduct**, where equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) may also apply.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **carves out fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from the general waiver of indirect damages and liability caps**, ensuring that:  
1. **Full damages (including consequential losses) can be claimed** for such misconduct.  
2. **Indemnification applies** to cover resulting losses.  
3. **Equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) may also be available** under broader enforcement provisions.

Here’s a breakdown of the relevance:

### 1. **Carveout for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** both include exceptions where the waiver of indirect/consequential damages and the general liability cap **do not apply**. Specifically:  
     - **Subsection (E)** in 11.6 and **Subsection (V)** in 11.7 exclude liability limitations for damages arising from a party’s **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**.  
     - This means that if a party engages in such conduct, they can still be held liable for **indirect, consequential, or other waived damages** (e.g., lost profits) despite the general limitation clauses.  

### 2. **Indemnification Linkage**  
   - **Article 12 (Indemnification)** reinforces this carveout by explicitly requiring indemnification for losses caused by **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (Sections 12.1(b) and 12.2(b)).  
   - The indemnification obligations are **unaffected by the liability limits** in Sections 11.6 and 11.7, as these carveouts are repeated in the indemnification context (e.g., 11.7(A)(V)).  

### 3. **Alignment with External Context**  
   - The external information (e.g., *Maud_417* and *Maud_102*) highlights that parties retain equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, especially where monetary damages are inadequate. The carveout for **fraud/gross negligence** aligns with this principle, as such conduct often warrants full legal accountability beyond contractual caps.  

### Key Takeaways:  
- The clause **preserves liability exposure** for intentional or egregious misconduct, ensuring parties cannot shield themselves from consequences of bad-faith actions.  
- It balances the general waiver of indirect damages with **public policy and fairness considerations**, as courts typically disallow limitations for fraud or gross negligence.  
- The indemnification provisions **operate independently** of liability caps, further emphasizing the seriousness of these carveouts.  

This structure ensures that while parties agree to limit liability for ordinary breaches, they remain fully accountable for **intentional or reckless wrongdoing**.",5

The provided clause (Sections 11.6 and 11.7) explicitly addresses this issue by carving out exceptions to the general waiver of liability for indirect/consequential damages and liability caps. Here’s how it relates to the query:

### Key Relevance:
1. **Carveout for Fraud/Gross Negligence/Willful Misconduct**  
   - Both Sections 11.6 and 11.7 exclude claims arising from **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** from the limitations on liability.  
   - **Section 11.6** states that the waiver of indirect/consequential damages (e.g., lost profits) does **not apply** if the damages result from a party’s fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection E).  
   - **Section 11.7** similarly exempts these actions from the aggregate liability cap (subsection (a)(V)).  

2. **Purpose of the Carveout**  
   - The carveout ensures that a party cannot shield itself from liability for **intentional or egregious wrongdoing** (fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct) by relying on the contract’s general limitations on damages.  
   - This aligns with common legal principles that prohibit parties from contractually avoiding liability for their own bad-faith actions.  

3. **Interaction with External Information**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_417 and MAUD_731) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable remedies** (like injunctions) for breaches. While not directly about damages, they reinforce that certain breaches (e.g., willful misconduct) may justify remedies beyond monetary compensation.  
   - The carveout in Sections 11.6–11.7 ensures that even if the contract limits most damages, **fraud or gross negligence** remains fully actionable, preserving the injured party’s right to recover all losses.  

### Practical Implications:
- A party engaging in fraud or gross negligence **cannot invoke** the contract’s liability caps or waivers to avoid paying full damages (including indirect/consequential damages).  
- This carveout acts as a **deterrent** against bad-faith conduct and ensures accountability.  

In summary, the clause directly addresses the query by clarifying that **fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct are exceptions to the waiver of indirect damages and liability limits**, ensuring such conduct is not protected under the agreement.",5
"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct carveout to indirect damage waiver",09b132b7ef,"8. Indemnification. Bioamber and Cargill agree to waive any and all claims against each other for consequential, punitive, incidental, special, or other forms of ""exemplary"" losses whether arising in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, including any losses relating to lost use, lost profits, lost business, damage to reputation, or lost or diminished financing unless such claims are based on a Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.","The clause you provided is a **waiver of indirect damages** (consequential, punitive, incidental, special, or exemplary losses) with a **carveout for gross negligence or willful misconduct**. This directly addresses the query about a ""fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct carveout to indirect damage waiver.""  

### Relevance to the Query:  
1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**:  
   - The clause broadly waives claims for consequential, punitive, and other indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) arising from contractual breaches, negligence, or strict liability.  

2. **Carveout for Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** if the damages result from a party’s **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.  
   - This means that if a party engages in such egregious conduct, the other party **can still claim indirect damages** (which would otherwise be waived).  

3. **Connection to External References**:  
   - The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_446) discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches, reinforcing that monetary damages alone may not suffice for intentional or reckless misconduct.  
   - Your clause aligns with this by ensuring that **intentional or grossly negligent wrongdoing** is not shielded by a standard waiver of indirect damages.  

### Key Takeaway:  
The clause ensures that while parties generally waive indirect damages (promoting contractual certainty), they retain recourse if the other party acts with **gross negligence or willful misconduct**—a common exception in indemnification and liability-limiting provisions.

Here’s the breakdown:

### **Key Aspects of the Clause:**
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause broadly disclaims liability for **special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages** arising under the agreement, regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, etc.).  
   - This waiver applies even if such damages were foreseeable or if a party was advised of their possibility.  

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**:  
   - The waiver **does not limit indemnification payments to third parties** under other sections (e.g., Article 10, Sections 16.1, 16.2).  
   - **Crucially**, the waiver **does not apply** in cases of:  
     - **Gross negligence**  
     - **Willful misconduct**  

   This means that if a party’s actions constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct, the other party **can still claim consequential damages** despite the general waiver.  

### **Relevance to the Query:**
- The clause explicitly **carves out gross negligence and willful misconduct** from the limitation on indirect/consequential damages.  
- While **fraud** is not expressly mentioned, **willful misconduct** often encompasses fraudulent behavior (depending on jurisdiction and contractual interpretation).  
- This aligns with the query’s focus on exceptions to liability waivers for **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**.  

### **Connection to External References:**
The external clauses (e.g., MAUD_102, MAUD_417) emphasize **equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions, specific performance)** for breaches, reinforcing that certain misconduct (like willful breaches) may justify broader remedies beyond contractual limitations.  

### **Conclusion:**
The clause **Section 16.5** is a clear example of a **carveout** where liability for indirect damages is waived **except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct** (and potentially fraud by extension). This ensures that parties remain accountable for egregious wrongdoing despite general damage limitations.

Here’s the breakdown:

### **1. Indirect Damages Waiver (Section 11.6)**  
- The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits) arising from the agreement.  
- **Exceptions to the waiver** include:  
  - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsection E).  
  - **Indemnification obligations** (subsection F, linked to Article 12).  
- **Key Takeaway**: The waiver **does not apply** to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, meaning a party **can still be held liable** for indirect damages in these cases.  

### **2. Liability Cap (Section 11.7)**  
- The agreement caps a party’s **aggregate liability** for claims under the agreement.  
- **Exceptions to the cap** include:  
  - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsection V).  
  - **Indemnification obligations** (subsection VI).  
- **Key Takeaway**: The liability limit **does not protect** a party from unlimited damages in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.  

### **3. Indemnification (Articles 12.1 & 12.2)**  
- Both parties must indemnify each other for **Third-Party Claims** arising from:  
  - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (subsection b in both 12.1 and 12.2).  
  - **Breach of contract or misrepresentation** (subsection a).  
- **Key Takeaway**: Indemnification obligations **override** the general waiver of indirect damages, meaning liability for fraud, negligence, or personal injury (e.g., worker’s compensation claims) is **not excluded**.  

### **Conclusion**  
- The **indirect damages waiver (11.6) does not apply** to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.  
- The **liability cap (11.7) also does not apply** in these cases.  
- **Indemnification provisions (Article 12)** explicitly hold parties accountable for third-party claims related to negligence, fraud, or personal injury.  

Thus, the clause **does not shield a party from liability for fraud, negligence, or personal injury**—these remain fully enforceable claims.

Here’s the breakdown:

### **1. Indirect Damages Waiver (Section 11.6)**  
- The clause **generally waives liability** for **indirect, consequential, incidental, or special damages** (e.g., lost profits) arising from the agreement.  
- **However, it explicitly carves out exceptions** where such a waiver **does not apply**, including:  
  - **Fraud** (Section 11.6(E))  
  - **Gross negligence or willful misconduct** (Section 11.6(E))  
  - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12** (which may include personal injury claims, as seen in Sections 12.1 and 12.2)  

This means that while **ordinary negligence** may be covered by the waiver, **fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct are excluded**, meaning a party can still be held liable for indirect damages in those cases.  

### **2. Liability Cap (Section 11.7)**  
- The clause imposes an **aggregate liability cap** for claims under the agreement.  
- **However, this cap does not apply to**:  
  - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (Section 11.7(A)(V))  
  - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12** (which includes personal injury claims, as seen in Sections 12.1(b) and 12.2(b))  

Thus, liability for **fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury (via indemnification)** is **uncapped**, meaning full damages (including indirect/consequential) may be recoverable.  

### **3. Indemnification (Article 12)**  
- **Sections 12.1 and 12.2** explicitly require indemnification for:  
  - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (12.1(b), 12.2(b))  
  - **Third-party claims** (which could include personal injury claims, e.g., worker’s compensation or liability claims under 12.1(d) and 12.2(d))  

Since indemnification is **excluded from the damages waiver and liability cap**, claims related to **fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury** remain fully enforceable.  

### **Conclusion**  
- The **indirect damages waiver (Section 11.6) does not apply** to **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**.  
- The **liability cap (Section 11.7) also does not apply** to these exceptions.  
- **Indemnification (Article 12) further ensures that personal injury claims (e.g., from negligence or fraud) are not limited by the damages waiver.**  

Thus, the clause confirms that **liability for fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury is not waived or capped**, meaning a party can still be held fully liable for indirect damages in such cases.

Here’s the breakdown:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Exclusions from the Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 11.6)**  
   The clause generally waives liability for indirect, consequential, or special damages (e.g., lost profits) **except** in specific cases, including:  
   - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (Subsection E)**  
   - Breaches of confidentiality (Article 10) or indemnification obligations (Article 12).  

   This means the waiver **does not apply** to claims involving fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. Such claims can still seek indirect/consequential damages.  

2. **Liability Cap Exceptions (Section 11.7)**  
   The agreement caps a party’s aggregate liability for claims **unless** the claim falls under exceptions, including:  
   - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (Subsection V)**  
   - Indemnification or confidentiality breaches.  

   Thus, liability for fraud or gross negligence is **uncapped**, and the waiver of indirect damages in Section 11.6 does not shield a party from full liability in these cases.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
- **Fraud/Negligence**: The clause explicitly carves out fraud and gross negligence from both the indirect damages waiver (Section 11.6) and the liability cap (Section 11.7). This means a party remains fully liable for these acts, including indirect damages.  
- **Personal Injury**: While not explicitly mentioned, personal injury claims often arise from negligence or willful misconduct. If such claims are tied to gross negligence or fraud, they would likely fall under the exceptions.  

### External Context:  
The provided external clauses (e.g., specific performance remedies) do not directly conflict with this analysis. They emphasize equitable relief for breaches but do not address damages waivers.  

### Conclusion:  
The clause **excludes fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from the indirect damages waiver and liability limits**, meaning a party can still be held liable for indirect damages (and uncapped amounts) in these cases. Personal injury claims linked to negligence/fraud would likely follow the same rule.  

**Practical Takeaway**: The waiver’s exceptions ensure that egregious misconduct (fraud/gross negligence) cannot evade full liability, aligning with common legal principles that prohibit shielding intentional or reckless harm.",5

misconduct or for damages deriving from fraud, death or personal injuries caused by negligence of wilful misconduct or any other liability to the extent
such liability may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.
27.2 Indirect Damages. In no event will either PARTY be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages in any way related to a relevant
PURCHASE ORDER, even if the damages are foreseeable or the possibility of the damages has been communicated.
27.3 Acknowledged Direct Damages. Any damages resulting from breach of confidentiality, privacy or data security obligations pursuant to an applicable
PURCHASE ORDER or these Ts&Cs are acknowledged to be direct damages and neither party will assert these damages are special, indirect or
consequential.

any of its AFFILIATES, be liable to SUPPLIER for damages arising under an applicable PURCHASE ORDER or these Ts&Cs for any cause whatsoever

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

### **1. Exclusion of Liability for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Personal Injury (27.1)**  
- The clause explicitly states that the limitations of liability **do not apply** to:  
  - **Gross negligence or wilful misconduct**  
  - **Fraud**  
  - **Death or personal injuries caused by negligence or wilful misconduct**  
  - **Any liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law**  
- This means that even if the contract waives indirect damages (27.2), a party **remains fully liable** for fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury claims.  

### **2. Waiver of Indirect Damages (27.2)**  
- The clause states that **neither party is liable for indirect, special, or consequential damages**, even if foreseeable.  
- However, this waiver **does not override** the exceptions in 27.1 (fraud, negligence, personal injury).  

### **3. Direct Damages vs. Indirect Damages (27.3 & 27.4-27.5)**  
- **Breach of confidentiality, privacy, or data security** is treated as **direct damages** (27.3), meaning they are **not waived** under the indirect damages exclusion.  
- The **general cap on liability** (27.4-27.5) applies to contractual breaches but **does not limit liability** for fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury (as per 27.1).  

### **Conclusion**  
- The **indirect damages waiver (27.2) does not apply** to fraud, negligence, or personal injury claims because:  
  - **27.1 explicitly preserves liability** for these categories.  
  - Such liability is often **non-waivable under law** (e.g., tort claims for personal injury).  
- The clause ensures that while parties limit exposure for **contractual breaches**, they **cannot escape liability** for intentional wrongdoing or harm to individuals.  

Thus, the **indirect damages waiver does not shield a party from liability for fraud, negligence, or personal injury**—these remain fully enforceable claims.",5

ARTICLE 10","The **query** asks whether an **indirect damages waiver** in a contract applies to a party's liability for **fraud, negligence, or personal injury**.  

### **Analysis of Clause 9.5 (Limitation of Liability)**  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, and other speculative damages** arising from:  
     - Contract  
     - Tort  
     - Negligence  
     - Breach of statutory duty  
   - This waiver applies **unless an exception applies**.  

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver (Where Liability Remains)**  
   The clause **explicitly carves out** liability in two key scenarios:  
   - **(I) Fraud or Breach of IP/Confidentiality Obligations**  
     - If a party commits **fraud** or breaches **Article 7 (Intellectual Property)** or **Article 10 (Confidentiality)**, the waiver **does not apply**, meaning the party **can still be held liable for indirect damages**.  
   - **(II) Third-Party Indemnified Claims**  
     - If damages must be paid to a third party under an indemnified claim, the waiver **does not apply**.  

3. **Relevance to the Query**  
   - **Fraud:** The clause **expressly excludes fraud** from the waiver, meaning a party **can be liable for indirect damages** if fraud is proven.  
   - **Negligence:** The waiver **does apply to negligence** (since negligence is listed among the excluded liabilities), **unless** the negligence leads to a breach of IP/confidentiality obligations or fraud.  
   - **Personal Injury:** The clause does **not explicitly mention personal injury**, but since personal injury claims often arise from **tort or negligence**, the waiver **could apply** unless another exception (e.g., fraud or indemnification) is triggered.  

### **Conclusion**  
- **Fraud:** Not waived—indirect damages remain recoverable.  
- **Negligence:** Waived **unless** tied to fraud, IP breach, or confidentiality breach.  
- **Personal Injury:** Likely waived **unless** linked to fraud or indemnifiable third-party claims.  

The clause thus **partially answers the query** by confirming that fraud is excluded from the waiver, while negligence and personal injury are generally covered unless an exception applies.

Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The clause **ARTICLE 9 - INDEMNIFICATION** is highly relevant to the query regarding a **personal or bodily injury exception to the waiver of indirect damages via an indemnification carveout**. Here’s how:

### **1. Indemnification for Personal/Bodily Injury**  
The clause explicitly covers indemnification for:  
- **""Injury to or death of a person""** (Section 9.1(a)), meaning it carves out an exception for bodily injury claims from any general waiver of indirect damages.  
- This ensures that claims arising from personal injury (e.g., workplace accidents, third-party harm) are **not waived** even if indirect damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) are otherwise excluded elsewhere in the agreement.  

### **2. Scope of Indemnification (Direct vs. Indirect Damages)**  
- The indemnification applies to **""any and all loss... whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding""**, which includes **direct damages** (e.g., medical costs, property damage) and potentially **indirect damages** (e.g., consequential losses) tied to bodily injury.  
- However, the clause does **not explicitly exclude indirect damages** for personal injury claims, suggesting they may still be recoverable under indemnification unless another provision (e.g., a general limitation of liability clause) overrides this.  

### **3. Claims Procedure Reinforces Carveout**  
- The **Claims Notice and defense process** (Section 9.1(b)) ensures that personal injury claims are handled with specific procedures, including:  
  - The indemnifying party’s obligation to defend or settle (subject to consent rules).  
  - The right of the indemnified party to act if the indemnifier fails to do so.  
- This structured process underscores that bodily injury claims are treated as **separate from general liability waivers**, preserving recourse for such harms.  

### **4. Interaction with External Clauses (Specific Performance)**  
The external clauses (e.g., **Section 8.5(c)** and **Section 9.10**) emphasize that equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) are available for breaches, but they do **not limit indemnification for bodily injury**. Instead, they reinforce that monetary damages may be inadequate for certain breaches, indirectly supporting the carveout for personal injury claims (which often require financial compensation).  

### **Conclusion**  
This indemnification clause **carves out an exception for bodily injury claims**, ensuring they are **not waived even if indirect damages are otherwise excluded**. The detailed claims procedure further protects this right, making it clear that personal injury liabilities are **separately enforceable** under the agreement.  

**Key Takeaway:** If the agreement elsewhere waives indirect damages, this indemnification clause likely **preserves the right to recover damages (direct and possibly indirect) for bodily injury** as a negotiated carveout.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout,469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The clause you provided (**Section 24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION**) is directly relevant to the query about a **""personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Carveout for Bodily Injury (Including Death)**
   - The clause explicitly includes indemnification for claims arising from **""bodily injury (including death)""** caused by the indemnifying party's negligence or intentional acts. This means that even if the broader contract includes a **waiver of indirect or consequential damages**, bodily injury claims are **carved out** and preserved as a separate, enforceable obligation under indemnification.  
   - This aligns with the query by confirming that personal/bodily injury is treated as an **exception** to any general limitation on damages.

### 2. **Allocation of Fault for Negligence**
   - The clause addresses scenarios where the indemnified party or a third party contributes to the injury through negligence or intentional acts. In such cases, liability is **proportionally allocated** based on relative fault.  
   - This reinforces that bodily injury claims are **not categorically waived** but instead subject to a fault-based indemnification framework, further supporting the carveout nature of such claims.

### 3. **Indemnification vs. Waiver of Damages**
   - While a contract may waive **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm), indemnification clauses like this one **preserve direct claims** for bodily injury and property damage.  
   - The clause operates as a **carveout** to ensure that third-party claims for physical harm remain actionable, even if other types of damages are excluded elsewhere in the agreement.

### 4. **Link to External Context (Specific Performance)**
   - The external references (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 7.11) emphasize **specific performance** and **equitable relief** for breaches, but they do not conflict with this indemnification clause. Instead, they highlight that certain obligations (like bodily injury indemnification) may be enforced separately from monetary damages.  
   - The indemnification clause thus functions as a **standalone remedy** for bodily injury, unaffected by broader limitations on indirect damages.

### **Conclusion**  
This clause explicitly **carves out bodily injury claims** from any general waiver of indirect damages, ensuring they remain covered under indemnification. It also clarifies how fault is apportioned, reinforcing that such claims are treated distinctly from other types of damages. This directly addresses the query by demonstrating how personal injury exceptions are structured in indemnification provisions.

This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The query concerns whether a **personal or bodily injury exception** exists to the waiver of indirect damages (e.g., consequential, special, or lost profits) when indemnification is invoked. Here’s how the clause (**Section 12.3 and 12.4**) relates to the query:

### Key Points from the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (including lost profits).  
   - However, it **carves out an exception for indemnifiable losses**, meaning indemnification obligations (e.g., under Section 12) can still cover such damages if they qualify as ""Indemnifiable Losses.""

2. **Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - Caps each party’s aggregate liability at a specified amount (redacted as $[* * *]).  
   - This cap applies **regardless of the claim type** (contract, tort, negligence) or whether indemnification is invoked.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury** as an exception to the waiver of indirect damages.  
- However, if bodily injury claims qualify as **""Indemnifiable Losses""** under the agreement (e.g., under indemnification provisions elsewhere in Section 12), they could **override the indirect damages waiver** in Section 12.3.  
- The **liability cap in Section 12.4** would still apply unless another provision (e.g., an indemnification carveout) explicitly excludes bodily injury from the cap.  

### External Context (Specific Performance Clauses):
The external excerpts (e.g., Sections 8.5 and 9.10) emphasize **equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not address bodily injury or indemnification. They suggest the agreement prioritizes specific performance over monetary damages, but this is **not directly relevant** to the query.  

### Conclusion:
To determine if bodily injury is exempt from the indirect damages waiver:  
1. Check the **definition of ""Indemnifiable Losses""** in the agreement. If it includes bodily injury, indemnification could cover such claims despite Section 12.3.  
2. Review **other carveouts** (e.g., gross negligence, willful misconduct) that might override the liability cap in Section 12.4.  
3. If the agreement is silent, bodily injury claims may **default to the general waiver and cap**, unless implied by law (e.g., statutory exceptions for personal injury).

Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause **""No Liability for Consequential Damages"" (Section 12.3)** and **""Limitation on Liability"" (Section 12.4)** are relevant to the query regarding a **personal or bodily injury exception to the waiver of indirect damages via an indemnification carveout** in the following ways:

### 1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, or special damages**, including **loss of profits**.  
   - However, it **carves out indemnification obligations**, meaning that if a claim falls under **indemnifiable losses**, the waiver of indirect damages does not apply.  

### 2. **Indemnification Carveout & Potential Exception for Personal/Bodily Injury**  
   - The clause does **not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury** as an exception to the waiver of indirect damages.  
   - However, if **indemnifiable losses** (as referenced in Section 12.3) include **personal or bodily injury claims**, then such damages **would not be waived** under this clause.  
   - If the indemnification provisions elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., Section 12) cover **third-party claims for bodily injury**, then the **waiver of indirect damages would not apply** to such claims.  

### 3. **Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - This section imposes a **monetary cap** on liability **for all causes of action**, including **contract, tort, negligence, and indemnification claims**.  
   - However, if **personal/bodily injury claims** are covered under indemnification, they would still be subject to the **cap** unless another exception applies.  

### **Relevance to the Query**  
- The clause **does not explicitly exclude personal/bodily injury** from the waiver of indirect damages, but if such claims are **covered under indemnification**, they would **not be barred** by Section 12.3.  
- The **external information** (Sections 8.5 and 9.10) discusses **specific performance and equitable relief**, but does not directly address bodily injury exceptions. Thus, the answer must rely on the indemnification carveout in Section 12.3.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause **permits indirect damages in indemnification cases**, meaning if **personal/bodily injury claims are indemnifiable**, they would **not be waived**. However, unless the indemnification section explicitly includes such injuries, the waiver of indirect damages could still apply. A **clear carveout for bodily injury** would be needed for full protection.

personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout,0eabff6ea5,"14.4 Indemnification You shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent by law us, our affiliates and our respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, and agents, (collectively the ""Indemnitees"") from any and all losses and expenses (as hereinafter defined) incurred in connection with any litigation or other form of adjudicatory procedure, claim, demand, investigation, or formal or informal inquiry (regardless of whether same is reduced to judgment) or any settlement thereof which arises directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business including, but not limited to, claims arising as a result of the maintenance and operation of vehicles (collectively an ""event""), and regardless of whether same resulted from any strict or vicarious liability imposed by law on the Indemnitees; provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any liability arising from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees (except to the extent that joint liability is involved, in which event the indemnification provided herein shall extend to any finding of comparative negligence or contributory negligence attributable to you).

Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause you provided (Section 14.4 Indemnification) is relevant to the query about a **""personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout""** in the following ways:

### 1. **Indemnification Scope and Indirect Damages**  
   - The clause broadly requires the indemnifying party (""You"") to cover **""any and all losses and expenses""** incurred by the Indemnitees, including **compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages**, fines, legal fees, and other costs arising from claims related to the operation of the Franchised Business (e.g., vehicle maintenance).  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect damages,"" the inclusion of **punitive damages, reputational harm, and other consequential costs** suggests that indirect damages (e.g., secondary financial impacts of bodily injury claims) could fall under this indemnification obligation unless explicitly excluded.  

### 2. **Carveout for Gross Negligence**  
   - The indemnification obligation **does not apply to liabilities arising from the Indemnitees’ gross negligence** (unless joint liability is involved).  
   - This acts as a **limited carveout**, but it does not specifically address **bodily injury or personal injury claims**. If such claims arise from ordinary negligence (not gross negligence), they would still be covered by the indemnity.  

### 3. **No Explicit Exception for Bodily/Personal Injury**  
   - The clause does not contain a **specific exclusion for bodily/personal injury claims**. In many contracts, indemnification clauses explicitly exclude or limit liability for personal injury to avoid overreach (e.g., under state laws that prohibit indemnification for one’s own negligence).  
   - Here, bodily injury claims (e.g., from vehicle accidents) would likely be covered under the broad language of ""any litigation or claim"" arising from the Franchised Business, unless another provision in the agreement carves them out.  

### 4. **Relevance to Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - If the broader contract includes a **waiver of indirect damages** (not shown in this clause), this indemnification provision could **override that waiver** for covered claims (e.g., by requiring reimbursement of consequential legal costs tied to bodily injury suits).  
   - The carveout for gross negligence does not protect the indemnifying party from indirect damages stemming from **ordinary negligence** (e.g., medical costs, lost wages from an injury).  

### Key Takeaway:  
This clause **does not explicitly exclude bodily/personal injury claims** from indemnification, meaning such claims could fall under the broad coverage of ""losses and expenses."" If the query seeks to limit this, the contract would need:  
1. An **express carveout** for bodily/personal injury in the indemnification clause.  
2. A **clear waiver of indirect damages** that explicitly applies to indemnified claims (or excludes injury-related damages).  

The external references provided (e.g., termination fees, specific performance) are unrelated to this issue. For a complete analysis, review the contract’s **limitation of liability** and **waiver of damages** sections to see if they conflict with or modify this indemnification obligation.

first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages,50fb101172,"ARTICLE X WAIVER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   The clause broadly waives liability for **consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages** (including lost profits) between the parties (""first-party claims"") arising from breaches of the agreement.  

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**:  
   The waiver **does not apply** to a party’s obligation to **indemnify the other party against claims by unaffiliated third parties** (e.g., customers, vendors, or regulators). Importantly, this exception allows third-party claims for the very types of damages waived between the parties (e.g., consequential or punitive damages).  

3. **Scope of the Exception**:  
   - The exception is **narrow**: It only covers indemnification obligations for third-party claims, not direct claims between the parties.  
   - It ensures that if a third party sues Party A for indirect damages, Party B (the indemnifying party) must still cover those damages, even though Party A could not claim such damages directly from Party B under the agreement.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **explicitly carves out third-party claims** from the waiver of indirect damages, which aligns with the query’s focus on exceptions.  
- However, it **does not create any exception for first-party claims** (direct claims between the parties). The waiver of indirect damages between the parties remains absolute, subject only to the third-party indemnification carveout.  

### Connection to External References:
The external clauses (e.g., **specific performance** provisions) emphasize equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches but do not override the waiver of monetary damages for indirect losses. They reinforce that:  
- Non-monetary remedies (like specific performance) are preserved.  
- The waiver of indirect damages (Article X) is distinct and remains enforceable, except as explicitly exempted (e.g., third-party claims).  

### Conclusion:
The clause strictly limits first-party claims for indirect damages **without exception**, while allowing indemnification for third-party claims. If the query seeks an exception for **first-party** indirect damages (e.g., fraud, willful misconduct), such an exception is **not present** in this clause. Any such exception would need to be explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement.

first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages,1c7fb9c26d,"10) NEITHER PARTY MAY CLAIM AND NEITHER PARTY IS LIABLE FOR CLAIMS FOR INDIRECT DAMAGES AND LOSSES, SUCH AS SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE, ANY LOSS OF ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED PROFIT, OR REVENUE, ANTICIPATED SAVINGS OR BUSINESS OR DAMAGE TO GOODWILL OR BRAND EQUITY, ARE EXCLUDED.","The query concerns a **""first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages""**—essentially, whether a party can still claim indirect damages despite a general waiver of liability for such damages in the contract.  

### **Relevance of the Clause to the Query**  
The provided clause (Clause 10) explicitly **waives liability for indirect damages** (e.g., consequential losses, lost profits, reputational harm) for **both parties**. However, the **external information** (Sections 9.10 and 8.5) suggests that:  
1. **Specific performance and equitable relief** (e.g., injunctions) are preserved as remedies, even if monetary damages are waived.  
2. These sections imply that **certain breaches may justify non-monetary remedies** despite the general waiver of indirect damages.  

### **Key Implications for the Query**  
- **No Direct Exception for First-Party Claims:** The clause does not explicitly carve out an exception allowing a first party (e.g., the claiming party) to recover indirect damages. It applies equally to both parties.  
- **Possible Override by Equitable Remedies:** If a breach justifies **specific performance or injunctive relief** (as referenced in the external sections), a party might still seek **non-monetary enforcement** even if indirect damages are waived.  
- **Contract Interpretation:** If the parties intended an exception (e.g., for fraud, willful breach, or certain indemnified claims), it would need to be **expressly stated elsewhere** (e.g., in Section 8.3(d) or 7.4, as referenced in the external text).  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause broadly **excludes liability for indirect damages** without an explicit first-party exception. However, the external context suggests that **equitable remedies (like specific performance) may still apply**, meaning a party could enforce contractual obligations without claiming monetary damages. If the query seeks an exception for first-party claims, it would need to be **explicitly drafted into the agreement** (e.g., via carve-outs for certain breaches or indemnification provisions).

first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages,6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The query asks about a **""first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages""** in the context of a limitation of liability clause. Here’s how **Clause 13.4** is relevant:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause broadly waives liability for **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, punitive damages) for claims between the parties (""first-party claims""), unless:  
     - There’s a breach of confidentiality (Section 11), or  
     - Indemnification obligations apply (e.g., third-party claims).  

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**:  
   - The waiver **does not apply** to indirect damages awarded to a **third party** (e.g., a customer or regulator) and passed through as a **Third Party Claim** under indemnification.  
   - Example: If a third party sues Party A for consequential damages due to Party B’s actions, Party B could still be liable to Party A for those damages under indemnity.  

3. **No Exception for First-Party Claims**:  
   - The clause **does not carve out** exceptions for first-party claims (direct disputes between the contracting parties) beyond confidentiality breaches or indemnification.  
   - This means a party cannot sue the other for its own **indirect damages** (e.g., lost profits) unless they arise from a third-party claim or confidentiality breach.  

### Relevance to the Query:  
The clause **reinforces the waiver of indirect damages for first-party claims** (with limited exceptions), while allowing recovery of such damages if they stem from a **third-party claim**. The external references (e.g., Sections 11.13 and 8.5(c)) highlight equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) but do not override this limitation—they address **specific performance**, not monetary damages for breaches.  

### Practical Implication:  
If a party seeks indirect damages (e.g., lost revenue) for a first-party claim (not involving confidentiality or indemnity), this clause would **bar such recovery**. The exception only applies if the damages originate from a third-party claim.

However, it includes an **exception** for indemnification claims related to third-party claims.  

### **Relevance to the Query (""first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages"")**  
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - The clause states that neither party is liable for indirect or consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) even if caused by negligence or fault.  
   - This is a broad limitation on damages that could otherwise be claimed by either party.  

2. **Exception for Third-Party Indemnification Claims**  
   - The key exception is that the waiver **does not apply** to indemnification obligations for third-party claims.  
   - If a third party sues one party (e.g., for IP infringement, breach of contract), and that party seeks indemnification from the other, the waiver **does not prevent recovery of indirect damages** related to that third-party claim.  

3. **First-Party Claims vs. Third-Party Claims**  
   - The clause **does not** carve out an exception for **first-party claims** (direct claims between the contracting parties).  
   - Thus, if Party A sues Party B directly for breach of contract, Party A **cannot** recover indirect damages (unless another provision allows it).  
   - However, if Party A is sued by a third party and seeks indemnification from Party B, Party A **can** recover indirect damages (e.g., legal costs, settlement amounts, reputational harm flowing from the third-party claim).  

### **Connection to External References**  
The external references discuss **specific performance** and **equitable remedies**, reinforcing that:  
- Monetary damages may not always suffice (hence the need for injunctions or specific performance).  
- However, the waiver of indirect damages (as in your clause) still applies unless an exception (like indemnification for third-party claims) is triggered.  

### **Conclusion**  
The clause is relevant to the query because it:  
- **Waives indirect damages** for first-party claims (direct disputes between the parties).  
- **Preserves the right to recover indirect damages** when indemnifying a party for third-party claims.  
- Does **not** provide an exception for first-party claims (unless another clause overrides this).  

If the query is about whether a first-party claim can bypass the waiver, the answer is **no**—unless another provision (e.g., fraud, willful misconduct, or a separate indemnity clause) creates an exception.",5

Here’s how the clause addresses this:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly states that the **Provider** (second party) **shall not be liable for incidental or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits or revenues), even if the Company (first party) warned of such potential losses.  
   - This is a **broad waiver of indirect damages** in favor of the Provider.

2. **Exceptions to Liability Limitations**:  
   The clause carves out **four exceptions** where liability is **not waived** and direct damages are recoverable:  
   - **(a) Bodily injury/death** caused by negligence.  
   - **(b) Property damage** caused by negligence.  
   - **(c) Willful/intentional misconduct**.  
   - **(d) Other direct damages** (capped at fees paid in the prior 12 months).  

   These exceptions allow the **first party (Company)** to claim **direct damages** in specific scenarios, despite the general waiver of indirect damages.  

3. **First Party’s Right to Specific Performance (External Context)**:  
   The external references (e.g., *Section 8.5* and *Section 9.10*) highlight that parties retain rights to **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) for breaches, even where monetary damages are limited. This suggests:  
   - The waiver of indirect damages does not preclude **non-monetary remedies** for the first party.  
   - The first party may still enforce performance or seek injunctive relief if the Provider breaches the agreement.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause **waives indirect damages** (e.g., consequential losses) **but preserves the first party’s right to claim direct damages** in enumerated cases (bodily injury, property damage, willful misconduct, etc.).  
- The **first party’s claims are not fully barred**—they can recover for **provable direct harms** and may also seek **specific performance** (per the external sections).  
- The Provider’s waiver of indirect damages is **not absolute**; it is subject to these exceptions, which protect the first party’s core interests.  

### Conclusion:
The clause balances a **general waiver of indirect damages** with **targeted exceptions** for first-party claims involving direct harm or misconduct. The external context further clarifies that equitable remedies (like specific performance) remain available, ensuring the first party retains enforcement tools beyond monetary compensation.

Here’s a breakdown of the relevance:

### 1. **Carveout for Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**  
   - **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** both exclude liability for indirect/consequential damages (e.g., lost profits) **unless** the damages arise from specific exceptions, including:  
     - A party’s **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (clauses E in 11.6 and V in 11.7).  
     - Indemnification obligations under **Article 12** (clauses F in 11.6 and VI in 11.7).  
   - This means that even though indirect damages are generally waived, they **remain recoverable** in cases involving intentional wrongdoing or extreme negligence.  

### 2. **Indemnification Link to Misconduct**  
   - **Article 12 (Indemnification)** further reinforces this carveout by requiring each party (BLI and Ginkgo) to indemnify the other for third-party claims arising from:  
     - **Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct** (clauses (b) in both Sections 12.1 and 12.2).  
   - The indemnification obligations thus **preserve liability** for direct and indirect damages tied to misconduct, even if other liability caps (e.g., Section 11.7’s aggregate limit) would otherwise apply.  

### 3. **Interaction with Waivers**  
   - The clauses create a **hierarchy of liability**:  
     1. **General waiver**: Indirect damages are excluded (Section 11.6).  
     2. **Exceptions**: Fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct and indemnification claims **override the waiver**, allowing recovery of such damages.  
     3. **Indemnification as a separate remedy**: Article 12 ensures that third-party claims (e.g., lawsuits due to a party’s misconduct) are fully covered, bypassing the contractual limitations on direct/indirect damages.  

### 4. **External Context (Enforcement & Equitable Relief)**  
   - The external information (e.g., MAUD clauses) highlights that parties may seek **injunctive relief** for breaches, especially where monetary damages are inadequate. While not directly tied to the fraud/gross negligence carveout, this underscores that:  
     - Misconduct (e.g., willful breach) could trigger **equitable remedies** beyond monetary damages.  
     - The indemnification carveout ensures that受害方 can recover losses (including indirect damages) caused by bad-faith actions.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The clause explicitly **carves out fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** from limitations on indirect damages and liability caps, ensuring that:  
- These actions remain fully actionable under indemnification.  
- The waiver of consequential damages does not shield a party from liability for intentional or egregious wrongdoing.

Here’s a breakdown of the relevance:

### 1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages with Exceptions (Section 11.6)**  
   - The clause generally waives liability for **indirect/consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits) arising from the agreement.  
   - However, it **carves out exceptions** where such damages are still recoverable, including:  
     - **Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** (subsection E).  
     - **Indemnification obligations under Article 12** (subsection F).  
   - This means that if a party’s conduct involves fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the waiver of indirect damages **does not apply**, and the harmed party can seek these damages.  

### 2. **Liability Cap with Exceptions (Section 11.7)**  
   - The agreement caps aggregate liability for claims, but this cap **does not apply** to:  
     - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection V).  
     - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (subsection VI).  
   - This reinforces that **intentional or egregious misconduct** (fraud/gross negligence) and indemnification claims are treated differently, allowing full recovery beyond standard liability limits.  

### 3. **Indemnification Carveouts (Articles 12.1 and 12.2)**  
   - The indemnification provisions explicitly cover **Losses arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** by either party (BLI or Ginkgo).  
   - For example:  
     - Section 12.1(b): BLI must indemnify Ginkgo for Losses caused by BLI’s **negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct**.  
     - Section 12.2(b): Ginkgo must indemnify BLI for similar misconduct.  
   - These indemnification obligations **override** the general waiver of indirect damages (Section 11.6) and liability cap (Section 11.7), ensuring that victims of misconduct can recover fully.  

### **Key Takeaways for the Query**  
- The clause **preserves the right to claim indirect damages** and **full indemnification** for losses caused by fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, despite the general waiver/consequential damages ban.  
- The indemnification carveouts ensure that these exceptions are **enforceable** and not diluted by liability limitations.  
- The external references (e.g., irreparable harm, equitable relief) further support that breaches involving misconduct may justify **specific performance or injunctive relief** beyond monetary damages.

Here’s how:

### Key Points of Relevance:
1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 11.6)**  
   - The clause broadly excludes liability for indirect, consequential, or special damages (e.g., lost profits) arising from the agreement, **unless** the damages fall under specific carveouts.  
   - One of these carveouts (subsection (E)) explicitly **preserves liability for damages arising from a party’s fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**. This means that if such misconduct occurs, the injured party can still claim indirect/consequential damages that would otherwise be waived.

2. **Liability Cap Exception (Section 11.7)**  
   - The agreement imposes an overall cap on liability for claims related to the agreement, **but** this cap does not apply to certain exceptions, including:  
     - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection (a)(V)).  
     - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (subsection (a)(VI)).  
   - This reinforces that **fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct** (and indemnification claims) are treated as **unlimited liabilities**, allowing full recovery of damages (including indirect damages) despite the general waiver or cap.

3. **Indemnification Carveout Connection**  
   - The query mentions an ""indemnification carveout,"" which aligns with subsection (F) of Section 11.6 and subsection (a)(VI) of Section 11.7. These provisions ensure that indemnification obligations (e.g., under Article 12) are **not subject to the waiver of indirect damages or the liability cap**.  
   - Fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct is treated similarly to indemnification—both are **exceptions to the limitations on damages and liability**.

### Why This Matters for the Query:
- The clause explicitly **carves out fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct** from the waiver of indirect damages and liability caps, ensuring that a party engaging in such misconduct cannot shield itself from full liability.  
- This aligns with common legal principles where **intentional or egregious misconduct** is not protected by contractual limitations.  
- The indemnification carveout operates similarly, preserving the right to claim uncapped damages (including indirect/consequential) for indemnified matters.  

### External Context (Enforcement/Specific Performance):
The external information provided (Sections 10.12) discusses equitable remedies (e.g., injunctions) for breaches, but it does not directly conflict with the damages limitations in Sections 11.6–11.7. The carveouts ensure that even if specific performance is sought, the exceptions for fraud/gross negligence/indemnification remain enforceable for monetary damages.

### Summary:
The clause answers the query by:  
1. **Allowing claims for indirect damages** in cases of fraud/gross negligence/willful misconduct (Section 11.6(E)).  
2. **Exempting such misconduct (and indemnification) from liability caps** (Section 11.7(a)(V)–(VI)).  
3. Treating these exceptions as **parallel carveouts**, ensuring they override general limitations on damages.

"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout",469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The **General Indemnification Clause (Section 24.0)** is relevant to the query about **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct exceptions to the waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveouts** in the following ways:

### 1. **Scope of Indemnification**  
The clause requires each party to indemnify the other for claims arising from **""negligent or intentional acts or omissions""** (including third-party claims for bodily injury or property damage). This includes:  
   - **Gross negligence**: Covered under ""negligent acts or omissions.""  
   - **Willful misconduct**: Covered under ""intentional acts or omissions.""  
   - **Fraud**: While not explicitly mentioned, fraud could fall under ""intentional acts"" if it causes the claimed harm.  

### 2. **Allocation of Fault**  
The clause includes a **proportional liability** mechanism:  
   - If the indemnified party or a third party contributed to the harm through their own negligence or intentional acts, damages are allocated based on **relative fault**.  
   - This implies that **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct by the indemnified party** could reduce or eliminate the indemnifying party’s obligation.  

### 3. **Indemnification Carveouts**  
While the clause does not explicitly waive indirect damages (e.g., consequential, punitive), it focuses on **direct claims** (bodily injury, property damage).  
   - If the contract elsewhere **waives indirect damages**, this indemnification clause could still apply to **direct damages** caused by fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.  
   - The **carveout** would ensure that even if indirect damages are waived, indemnification remains available for **intentional or egregious misconduct**.  

### 4. **Link to External Context**  
The referenced external clauses (e.g., **specific performance** in Sections 7.11 and 8.5) highlight that equitable remedies (like injunctions) are preserved for breaches. Similarly:  
   - The indemnification clause **preserves remedies** for misconduct (fraud, gross negligence) even if other limitations (e.g., waivers of indirect damages) exist.  
   - Courts may interpret such clauses to **carve out exceptions** for bad-faith conduct.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
This indemnification clause supports the idea that **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct are not shielded by general waivers of liability**. Instead:  
- They trigger indemnification for direct damages.  
- Proportional fault rules may adjust liability based on the parties' conduct.  
- The clause operates alongside (but does not override) other remedies like specific performance for breaches.

No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits. This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided (**Section 12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages** and **Section 12.4 Limitation on Liability**) is relevant to the query about exceptions to the waiver of indirect damages via an indemnification carveout, particularly in cases of **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct**. Here’s how:

### Key Points of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages (Section 12.3)**  
   - The clause generally excludes liability for **indirect, consequential, or special damages** (including loss of profits).  
   - However, it **carves out an exception for indemnifiable losses**, meaning that indemnification obligations (e.g., under Section 12) can still cover such damages if they qualify as ""Indemnifiable Loss.""

2. **Cap on Liability (Section 12.4)**  
   - The clause imposes a **monetary cap** on liability for all claims, including those arising from negligence or indemnification.  
   - Notably, it does **not explicitly exclude fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** from this cap.  

### Relevance to the Query:
- The query asks whether **fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct** could override the waiver of indirect damages via an indemnification carveout.  
- While the clause limits liability broadly (even for negligence), it does **not expressly address fraud or willful misconduct**.  
- Under general contract and tort law principles:  
  - **Fraud or willful misconduct** may **override contractual limitations on liability**, as courts often refuse to enforce caps or waivers for intentional wrongdoing.  
  - The indemnification carveout (allowing indirect damages for ""Indemnifiable Loss"") could potentially cover such misconduct if the indemnification clause itself does not exclude fraud/gross negligence.  

### Missing Clarity:
- The clause does **not explicitly state** whether indemnification applies to fraud/gross negligence. If the **definition of ""Indemnifiable Loss"" elsewhere in the agreement excludes intentional misconduct**, then the carveout might not apply.  
- The external information (e.g., **specific performance provisions**) suggests the parties prioritized equitable remedies for breaches but does not directly address liability caps for fraud.  

### Practical Implications:
- If a party seeks indirect damages due to fraud/gross negligence, they might argue:  
  - The indemnification carveout permits such claims if ""Indemnifiable Loss"" includes intentional acts.  
  - The liability cap in Section 12.4 is unenforceable for intentional misconduct under applicable law.  
- Conversely, the opposing party could argue the cap applies universally unless the agreement explicitly carves out fraud.  

### Conclusion:
The clause **limits indirect damages but preserves indemnification rights**, leaving room for debate about whether fraud/gross negligence falls under the indemnification carveout. To fully resolve the query, you’d need to review:  
1. The **definition of ""Indemnifiable Loss""** (to see if it excludes fraud/willful misconduct).  
2. **Governing law** (as some jurisdictions invalidate liability waivers for intentional wrongdoing).

In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","The clause you provided is a **seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages**, which directly addresses the query. Here’s how it aligns with the request:

### Key Seller-Favorable Protections:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly waives claims for **indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption, reputational harm).  
   - This shields the seller from broad financial exposure beyond direct losses.  

2. **Exclusion of Statutory/Punitive Damages**:  
   - The seller avoids liability for **punitive, exemplary, or statutory damages**, which are often unpredictable and disproportionately high.  

3. **Liability Cap**:  
   - Seller’s total liability is capped at the **purchase price paid** (or the value of the defective portion), further limiting financial risk.  

### Relevance to External Context:  
The external excerpts discuss **specific performance** (equitable relief for breaches) but do not address limitations on monetary damages. Your clause complements such provisions by:  
- Clarifying that **monetary remedies are restricted**, even if equitable relief (e.g., injunctions) is available under other sections.  
- Reinforcing the seller’s protection against expansive damages claims, which could otherwise undermine contractual certainty.  

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:  
- **Risk Allocation**: Buyer bears the risk of indirect losses (e.g., lost profits).  
- **Predictability**: Seller’s exposure is quantifiable (capped at purchase price).  
- **Legal Safeguards**: Broad waiver of non-direct damages under all legal theories (contract, tort, statute).  

This clause is a strong example of a **pro-seller limitation of liability**, prioritizing the seller’s financial protection over the buyer’s ability to recover full economic losses.

seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses,f52cb3b7ad,"IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER’S OR SELLER’S LIABILITY, ONE TO THE OTHER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE RESPECTIVE OTHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD 13 MILLION; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BAD FAITH, INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause you provided is a **limitation of liability provision** that caps the damages either party (Buyer or Seller) can recover from the other for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, or other obligations under the agreement at **USD 13 million**. However, it includes key exceptions where this cap does not apply, such as:  
- **Bad faith, intentional, or willful misconduct** by a party or its representatives.  
- **Third-party claims** for personal injury or property damage caused by a breach.  

### **Relevance to ""Seller-Favorable Waiver of Indirect Damages""**  
1. **Indirect Damages Limitation (Implied)**  
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect damages"" (e.g., consequential, incidental, or lost profits), the **USD 13 million cap** effectively limits most financial exposures, including indirect damages, unless an exception applies.  
   - This structure is **seller-favorable** because it shields the seller from open-ended liability for breaches, except in cases of intentional wrongdoing or third-party harm.  

2. **Exceptions Preserve Key Remedies**  
   - The carve-outs for **bad faith, willful misconduct, and third-party claims** ensure the seller remains liable for egregious conduct or tangible harm, balancing fairness while still limiting exposure.  

3. **Comparison with External Clauses**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., *M&A-specific performance provisions*) emphasize **equitable relief** (injunctions, specific performance) as remedies for breaches, but they do not conflict with the liability cap.  
   - Your clause complements such provisions by clarifying that **monetary damages** (direct or indirect) are strictly capped, reinforcing the seller’s protection.  

### **Why This is Seller-Favorable**  
- Predictable liability exposure (hard cap on damages).  
- Indirect damages are likely subsumed under the general cap unless proven to arise from willful misconduct.  
- Exceptions are narrow (favoring the seller’s risk control).  

**Drafting Tip:** To make this even more seller-favorable, you could:  
- Explicitly exclude **consequential, incidental, and punitive damages** (unless willful misconduct applies).  
- Clarify that the cap applies **cumulatively** (not per claim).

Here’s how it aligns with the query:

### Key Seller-Favorable Aspects:
1. **Broad Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - Section 8.2 explicitly excludes liability for **indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, or data), even if the party was advised of the possibility of such damages.  
   - This shields the seller (or the party drafting the clause) from high-risk financial exposures that often arise from breaches or operational failures, favoring their position.

2. **Narrow Exceptions**  
   - The waiver has limited carve-outs (e.g., third-party indemnification claims under Section 7.2 or breaches of confidentiality under Section 11.4).  
   - These exceptions are narrowly tailored, preserving the seller’s protection while allowing minimal recourse for the buyer.  

3. **Caps on Liability**  
   - Section 8.3 further limits aggregate liability (except for indemnification claims) to a capped amount ([***]), which is a seller-friendly mechanism to control financial risk.  

4. **Preservation of Specific Remedies**  
   - While indirect damages are waived, the clause clarifies that liquidated damages (Section 10.5.2) or equitable remedies (like injunctions, as referenced in the external examples) remain available. This ensures the seller retains enforceable rights without exposure to open-ended liability.  

### Why It’s Seller-Favorable:
- The clause systematically eliminates the buyer’s ability to claim common forms of damages (e.g., lost profits) that might arise from breaches, while allowing the seller to retain key protections (e.g., indemnification, liquidated damages).  
- The combination of a **consequential damages waiver** + **liability cap** disproportionately benefits the party seeking to limit post-contractual risks (often the seller in transactions).  

### Connection to External Context:  
The external examples (M&A clauses) emphasize **specific performance** and equitable relief as remedies for breaches, which complement this clause. Here, the waiver of indirect damages ensures that monetary remedies are tightly controlled, while non-monetary remedies (e.g., injunctions) remain intact—a balance that favors the party with stronger bargaining power (typically the seller).  

### Conclusion:  
This clause is a **classic seller-favorable provision** as it:  
1. Shifts risk to the buyer by excluding consequential damages.  
2. Limits total liability exposure.  
3. Preserves the seller’s right to enforce performance (via liquidated damages or equitable relief).

Here's the breakdown:

### **1. Waiver of Indirect Damages (Seller-Favorable)**
The clause states:  
> *""NEITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY... WILL INCLUDE CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.""*  

- This is a **broad waiver of indirect damages**, which is **seller-favorable** because it shields the seller (and buyer) from claims for consequential losses (e.g., lost profits, business interruption).  
- The fact that it applies **even if the other party was aware of the risk** makes it particularly strong in favor of the seller.  

### **2. Cap on Direct Damages (Balanced but Still Seller-Protective)**
> *""THE LIABILITY OF A PARTY TO THE OTHER FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS.""*  

- While this limits liability for both parties, it still benefits the seller by capping exposure to a fixed amount.  
- The exception for **Section 9 (Representations, Warranties, and Indemnification)** means that breaches of reps & warranties may still allow for uncapped damages, but **general performance breaches are limited**.  

### **3. Exception for Third-Party Physical Harm (Neutral)**
> *""EXCLUSIVE OF ANY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES FOR INJURY OR DAMAGES TO PERSONS OR TANGIBLE PROPERTY...""*  

- This carve-out ensures that **third-party bodily injury or property damage claims** are not limited, which is standard in many contracts (and often required by law).  

### **Comparison to External References**
- The **M&A clause (maud_417)** discusses **specific performance and injunctive relief** but does not address damages limitations.  
- The **representations clause (maud_898)** focuses on **accuracy of warranties at closing**, not liability caps.  

### **Conclusion**
This clause is **seller-favorable** because:  
✔ **Broadly excludes indirect damages** (even if foreseeable).  
✔ **Caps direct damages** (except for indemnification claims).  
✔ **Protects the seller from open-ended liability** while allowing standard exceptions for third-party harm.  

If the goal is to make the waiver **even more seller-friendly**, you could:  
- Remove exceptions (e.g., allow indirect damages waivers even for indemnification claims).  
- Lower the direct damages cap further.  
- Explicitly state that **no damages are recoverable beyond those expressly stated**.

THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY BUYER TO SUPPLIER UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM.","The clause you provided is a **seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages** clause, which is highly relevant to your query. Here’s how it aligns with the request and the external context:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause explicitly excludes liability for **indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages** (e.g., lost profits, business interruption).  
   - This is favorable to the **seller** (or Supplier), as it shields them from broad categories of damages that are often difficult to quantify and could expose them to significant financial risk.  

2. **Limitation of Liability Cap**:  
   - The clause further limits the seller’s total liability to the **amounts paid/payable by the Buyer under the applicable Order in the preceding 12 months**.  
   - This creates a predictable, finite exposure for the seller, reinforcing their protection.  

3. **Carve-Out for Irreparable Harm (Context from External Information)**:  
   - While the clause waives monetary damages for indirect losses, the external references (e.g., *Maud 102* and *Maud 199*) highlight that **equitable remedies** (e.g., injunctions, specific performance) remain available for breaches causing irreparable harm.  
   - This is consistent with the clause’s preamble (""NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE...""), which suggests it does not override non-monetary remedies explicitly preserved elsewhere in the agreement (e.g., in sections addressing specific performance).  

### Why This is Seller-Favorable:
- **Risk Allocation**: The seller avoids open-ended liability for consequential damages (e.g., downstream losses suffered by the Buyer’s business).  
- **Predictability**: The 12-month cap ensures the seller’s exposure is tied to contract revenue, not unforeseen risks.  
- **Alignment with Equitable Remedies**: The clause coexists with provisions allowing injunctive relief (per the external examples), ensuring the seller can still enforce the agreement’s terms without undermining the damages waiver.  

### Practical Implications:
- Buyers may push back on such clauses, as they bear the risk of indirect losses (e.g., lost profits from a defective product).  
- Sellers benefit from reduced litigation risk and exposure to speculative damages claims.  

In summary, this clause is a **strong seller-protective provision** that limits liability while preserving equitable remedies, consistent with the broader contractual framework seen in the external examples.",5

In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","The clause you provided is a **buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages** because it limits the seller's liability for certain types of damages, particularly indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, while still allowing the buyer to pursue other remedies (such as direct damages or specific performance, as referenced in the external information).  

### **Relevance to the Query:**  
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages:**  
   - The clause explicitly states that the **seller shall not be liable** for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, business interruption).  
   - This is **buyer-favorable** because it does not impose the same waiver on the buyer—meaning the buyer may still be able to claim indirect damages from the seller if the agreement is silent on reciprocal waivers.  

2. **Cap on Liability:**  
   - The seller’s total liability is **capped at the purchase price** paid by the buyer, which is a common limitation.  
   - However, this cap does not restrict the buyer’s ability to seek **specific performance or injunctive relief** (as seen in the external clauses), which are often preserved even when monetary damages are limited.  

3. **Preservation of Equitable Remedies (Implied by External Clauses):**  
   - The external clauses (e.g., *Section 9.10* and *Section 8.5*) emphasize that **specific performance and injunctive relief** remain available even when monetary damages are limited.  
   - This means the buyer can still enforce the contract terms (e.g., forcing the seller to deliver goods) even if they cannot recover certain financial losses.  

### **Why This is Buyer-Favorable:**  
- The seller bears a **one-sided waiver** of indirect damages, while the buyer retains flexibility.  
- The buyer may still pursue **equitable remedies** (specific performance) if the seller breaches.  
- The **liability cap** protects the seller but does not prevent the buyer from enforcing the contract itself.  

### **Potential Concerns for Buyers:**  
- If the buyer wants to **fully exclude** indirect damages for both parties, the clause should be **mutual** (e.g., ""Neither party shall be liable for indirect damages"").  
- The buyer should ensure that **exceptions** (e.g., fraud, willful misconduct, IP indemnification) are carved out if needed.  

### **Conclusion:**  
This clause is **buyer-favorable** because it restricts the seller’s liability for indirect damages without imposing the same restriction on the buyer, while still allowing the buyer to seek specific performance or other equitable remedies.

buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses,b9c6eb43b7,"8.2 No Consequential Damages. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT AWARDED TO A THIRD PARTY IN A JUDGMENT AGAINST WHICH A PARTY IS ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 7.2 [Indemnity], OR TO THE EXTENT ARISING OUT OF ANY BREACH OF SECTION 11.4 [Nondisclosure], NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY), TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR COST OF COVER OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS OR DATA) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISEDOF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH COSTS OR DAMAGES.

8.3 Limitation of Damages. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES UNDER SECTION 7.2 [Indemnity], NEITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL EXCEED [***].","The query seeks a **buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages clause**, which typically aims to limit a seller's ability to claim certain types of damages (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm) while preserving the buyer's rights to recover direct losses. The provided clause (**Section 8.2 No Consequential Damages** and **Section 8.3 Limitation of Damages**) is relevant to this query in the following ways:

### **1. Buyer-Favorable Aspects of the Waiver**
- **Exclusions for Indemnity and Breach of Confidentiality**:  
  The clause carves out exceptions where indirect/consequential damages **are** recoverable:  
  - If awarded to a third party in a judgment covered by indemnification (Section 7.2).  
  - If arising from a breach of nondisclosure obligations (Section 11.4).  
  This protects the buyer if the seller’s actions (e.g., leaking confidential information) cause harm beyond direct losses.  

- **Preservation of Liquidated Damages**:  
  The clause explicitly states it does not limit the buyer’s (ACSI’s) right to liquidated damages under **Section 10.5.2**, which is buyer-favorable as it ensures a predetermined remedy for certain breaches.  

### **2. Mutual Limitation with Buyer Protections**
- **Broad Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
  Both parties waive claims for **indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages** (e.g., lost profits, revenue, data). This is mutual but may disproportionately benefit the buyer if the seller’s potential indirect damages (e.g., reputational harm) are more significant.  

- **Cap on Aggregate Liability**:  
  Section 8.3 limits **total liability** (except for indemnity claims) to a capped amount ([***]). This protects both parties but can favor the buyer if the cap is high enough to cover typical direct losses while shielding the buyer from unlimited exposure.  

### **3. Interaction with External Context (Specific Performance)**
The external references highlight that **specific performance/injunctive relief** is available for breaches, even where damages are limited. This is buyer-favorable because:  
- The buyer can still force the seller to comply with key terms (e.g., delivery, confidentiality) without relying solely on monetary damages.  
- The waiver of indirect damages does not preclude equitable remedies, which may be critical for the buyer’s operational needs.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **moderately buyer-favorable** because:  
1. It excludes indemnity and confidentiality breaches from the waiver, protecting the buyer from third-party claims and leaks.  
2. It preserves liquidated damages and equitable remedies (per external context).  
3. The mutual cap on liability may favor the buyer if the seller’s risks (e.g., service failures) are more likely to trigger indirect damages.  

**Drafting Tip**: To make it **more buyer-favorable**, consider:  
- Explicitly allowing the buyer to claim indirect damages for seller breaches (e.g., delays, defects).  
- Narrowing the waiver to only apply to the seller’s claims against the buyer.  
- Adding carve-outs for buyer-specific risks (e.g., lost production time).

buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses,f52cb3b7ad,"IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER’S OR SELLER’S LIABILITY, ONE TO THE OTHER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE RESPECTIVE OTHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD 13 MILLION; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BAD FAITH, INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The query seeks a **buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages clause**, which typically aims to limit the buyer's exposure to certain types of damages (e.g., consequential, incidental, or punitive damages) while preserving the buyer's right to recover direct damages or enforce specific performance.  

### **Relevance of the Provided Clause to the Query:**  
The clause you provided is a **limitation of liability provision** (not strictly a waiver of indirect damages), but it has implications for the buyer's risk exposure:  

1. **Cap on Liability**  
   - The clause caps liability at **USD 13 million** for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations.  
   - This benefits the **buyer** by limiting financial exposure, but it is not explicitly a waiver of indirect damages.  

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**  
   - The cap **does not apply** to:  
     - **Bad faith, intentional/willful misconduct** (protecting the buyer if the seller acts maliciously).  
     - **Third-party claims for personal injury/property damage** (ensuring liability remains for tangible harm).  
   - These exceptions are **buyer-friendly** because they prevent the seller from escaping liability for egregious conduct.  

3. **Missing Explicit Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
   - A true **waiver of indirect damages** would explicitly exclude recovery for:  
     - Consequential damages (e.g., lost profits, business interruption).  
     - Incidental or punitive damages.  
   - This clause does **not** contain such language, meaning indirect damages could still be claimed (subject to the USD 13M cap).  

### **Connection to External References (Specific Performance Clauses)**  
The external references discuss **specific performance** and **equitable relief**, emphasizing that monetary damages may be inadequate for breaches. This is relevant because:  
- If the buyer wants to **enforce the deal** (e.g., in an M&A transaction), they may prefer **specific performance** over monetary damages.  
- A **buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages** might still allow for **specific performance** (as seen in the external clauses), ensuring the deal closes rather than just limiting financial liability.  

### **Suggested Improvement for Buyer-Favorability**  
To make this clause more **buyer-favorable** regarding indirect damages, consider adding:  
> *""Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall either party be liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages, except (i) for fraud or willful misconduct, or (ii) to the extent such damages are awarded to a third party in connection with a claim for personal injury or property damage.""*  

This would further protect the buyer from unpredictable, large-scale indirect losses while preserving key remedies.  

### **Conclusion**  
The current clause **partially aligns** with a buyer-favorable approach by capping liability and excluding bad faith claims, but it does **not explicitly waive indirect damages**. To fully address the query, an explicit exclusion of indirect damages (with carve-outs for fraud and third-party claims) should be added.",4
buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses,50fb101172,"ARTICLE X WAIVER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES, ANY SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST OR ANY BENEFICIARY OR ASSIGNEE OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, MULTIPLE, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY BREACH HEREOF; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS LIMITING AN OBLIGATION OF A PARTY HEREUNDER TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS THE OTHER PARTY AGAINST CLAIMS ASSERTED BY UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THIRD PARTY CLAIMS FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES. THIS ARTICLE X SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, FAULT OR RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTY WHOSE LIABILITY IS WAIVED BY THIS PROVISION, OR ANY OTHER EVENT OR CONDITION, WHETHER ANTICIPATED OR UNANTICIPATED, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER PRE-EXISTING PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause **""ARTICLE X WAIVER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES""** is highly relevant to the query regarding a **buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages** for the following reasons:

### **1. Broad Waiver of Indirect Damages**  
The clause explicitly waives liability for **consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive damages, and loss of profits or revenues**—all of which are categories of indirect damages. This is **buyer-favorable** because it limits the seller’s ability to claim these types of damages, which are often unpredictable and can be substantial.  

### **2. Exceptions for Third-Party Claims**  
While the clause broadly waives indirect damages between the parties, it **preserves indemnification obligations for third-party claims**, including third-party claims for indirect or consequential damages. This is important for buyers because:  
   - It ensures that if a third party sues the buyer for indirect damages (e.g., a customer claiming lost profits due to a product defect), the seller remains liable for such claims.  
   - This exception prevents the waiver from undermining the buyer’s protection against third-party risks.  

### **3. Strong Negligence & Fault Waiver**  
The clause states that the waiver applies **even if the damages result from the sole, joint, or concurrent negligence or fault of the party whose liability is waived**. This is **highly buyer-favorable** because:  
   - It prevents the seller from arguing that its own negligence should negate the waiver.  
   - It ensures the buyer is shielded from indirect damages even in cases where the seller is at fault.  

### **4. Contrast with External References (Specific Performance Clauses)**  
The external references (e.g., MAUD_102 and MAUD_446) discuss **specific performance and equitable relief**, which are remedies for breaches where monetary damages are inadequate. However, **Article X is different** because:  
   - It **does not limit equitable remedies** (like injunctions or specific performance), meaning the buyer can still seek court orders to enforce the deal.  
   - It **only limits monetary damages**, particularly indirect ones, which aligns with a buyer’s interest in capping unpredictable liabilities.  

### **Conclusion**  
This clause is **strongly buyer-favorable** because:  
- It **broadly waives indirect damages** between the parties.  
- It **preserves indemnity for third-party claims**, protecting the buyer from external risks.  
- It **applies even in cases of seller negligence**, making the waiver very robust.  
- It **does not restrict equitable remedies**, allowing the buyer to still enforce the contract through injunctions or specific performance if needed.  

If the buyer wants **further protection**, they could:  
- Clarify that **fraud or willful misconduct** are exceptions to the waiver.  
- Ensure that **direct damages** (e.g., costs of replacement or repair) remain fully recoverable.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 9 HEREOF, THE LIABILITY OF A PARTY TO THE OTHER FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. EXCLUSIVE OF ANY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES FOR INJURY OR DAMAGES TO PERSONS OR TANGIBLE PROPERTY DIRECTLY CAUSED BY ANY PRODUCT, NEITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ADVERTISING MATERIALS, IF ANY, WILL INCLUDE CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, EVEN IFTHE OTHER PARTY HAS KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.","The clause you provided is highly relevant to the query about **""buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses""** because it explicitly limits liability for indirect damages, which is a key consideration in contract negotiations, particularly from a buyer's perspective. Here’s how the clause aligns with the query:

### Key Aspects of the Clause:
1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**:  
   - The clause states that neither party will be liable for **""consequential, incidental, special, or other indirect damages, such as lost profits""**, even if the other party was aware such damages could occur.  
   - This is a **buyer-favorable** provision because it shields the buyer (and the seller) from unpredictable, large-scale financial exposures (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm, or business interruption costs). Buyers often seek this protection to avoid disproportionate liability for breaches.

2. **Cap on Direct Damages**:  
   - The clause caps liability for **direct damages** at **$15 million**, except for claims under **Section 9 (Representations, Warranties, and Indemnification)**.  
   - This further protects the buyer by limiting exposure to quantifiable, foreseeable losses while preserving recourse for breaches of core reps and warranties.

3. **Exceptions**:  
   - The waiver of indirect damages does not apply to third-party claims for **personal injury or tangible property damage** caused by a product. This is a standard carve-out to ensure basic tort liabilities remain enforceable.  
   - Claims under **Section 9** (e.g., indemnification for breaches of reps/warranties) are also excluded, allowing the buyer to pursue broader remedies for fundamental misrepresentations.

### Why This is Buyer-Favorable:
- **Risk Allocation**: The buyer avoids open-ended liability for speculative or disproportionate losses (e.g., lost profits from a delayed product launch).  
- **Predictability**: The $15 million cap on direct damages provides certainty, which buyers often prefer in negotiations.  
- **Preservation of Key Remedies**: By excluding Section 9 claims, the buyer retains the ability to seek indemnification for breaches of reps/warranties, which are critical in M&A or high-stakes contracts.  

### Connection to External Information:
- The external snippets highlight provisions related to **enforcement of obligations** (e.g., injunctive relief in Delaware courts) and **conditions to closing** (e.g., reps/warranties being true at consummation). These reinforce the importance of liability limitations like the one in your clause, as they define the parties' post-breach recourse.  

### Conclusion:
This clause is a **buyer-favorable limitation of liability** because it:  
1. Broadly waives indirect damages (protecting the buyer from unpredictable losses).  
2. Caps direct damages (providing financial certainty).  
3. Carves out critical protections (e.g., indemnification for breaches of reps/warranties).  

Buyers typically push for such terms to minimize post-closing exposure, while sellers may resist or seek narrower waivers. The balance struck here leans toward buyer protection.",5
