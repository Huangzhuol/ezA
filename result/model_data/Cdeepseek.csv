1. **Intellectual Property Rights**: The clause outlines the rights of the franchisor (the party granting the franchise) to use and license Proprietary Marks.

This is important for the interpretation and enforcement of the contract, as it sets the legal context in which any disputes will be resolved.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes that the agreement will be governed by California law, explicitly excluding the UCC and similar regulatory frameworks, thereby providing a clear legal framework for the parties involved.",5
Most Favored Nation Clause,47921871a2,"This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.","A Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause is a provision in a contract that ensures one party receives terms that are at least as favorable as those offered to any other party in similar circumstances. This clause is often used in trade agreements, licensing agreements, and other commercial contracts to ensure competitive fairness and to protect the interests of the party receiving the MFN treatment.

The clause you provided specifies that the agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding conflict of laws provisions and the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Here’s how this clause is relevant to the MFN clause:

1. **Legal Framework**: The governing law clause establishes the legal framework within which the MFN clause will be interpreted and enforced. California law will dictate how the MFN clause is applied, including any relevant case law or statutory provisions that may affect its enforceability.

2. **Exclusion of CISG**: By excluding the CISG, the parties are opting out of an international legal framework that could otherwise apply to their contract. This is significant because the MFN clause may have different implications under international law compared to domestic law. The exclusion ensures that the MFN clause is interpreted solely under California law, which may provide more clarity or predictability for the parties involved.

3. **Conflict of Laws**: The exclusion of conflict of laws provisions means that the parties intend for California law to apply without regard to the laws of other jurisdictions that might otherwise be relevant. This can be particularly important in MFN clauses, as they often involve comparisons of terms across different agreements or jurisdictions. A clear governing law helps avoid complications that could arise from differing legal interpretations.

In summary, the governing law clause is relevant to the MFN clause because it establishes the legal context in which the MFN obligations will be interpreted and enforced, ensuring that the parties have a clear understanding of their rights and obligations under California law.",4
Most Favored Nation Clause,2eff6f9356,"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of California, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.","The clause you provided specifies the governing law for the agreement, which is the State of California, and it excludes certain legal frameworks, such as conflict of laws provisions and the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). 

While this clause does not directly mention a Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause, it is relevant in the context of how the MFN clause would be interpreted and enforced under California law. 

A Most Favored Nation clause is typically included in contracts to ensure that one party receives terms that are at least as favorable as those offered to any other party in similar circumstances. This can be particularly important in commercial agreements where pricing, terms, or conditions may vary between different customers or partners.

Here’s how the governing law clause relates to the MFN clause:

1. **Legal Framework**: The enforcement and interpretation of an MFN clause would be subject to California law, as specified in the governing law clause. This means that any disputes regarding the MFN clause would be resolved according to California legal principles.

2. **Exclusion of CISG**: By excluding the CISG, the parties are opting out of an international legal framework that could potentially affect the interpretation of contract terms, including MFN clauses. This ensures that the MFN clause is interpreted solely under California law, which may have specific precedents or interpretations relevant to such clauses.

3. **Conflict of Laws**: The exclusion of conflict of laws provisions means that the parties have agreed to a clear jurisdiction for resolving disputes, which can provide certainty in how the MFN clause will be applied. If a dispute arises regarding whether one party is receiving less favorable terms than another, California law will govern the resolution of that dispute.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly mention a Most Favored Nation clause, it establishes the legal context in which such a clause would be interpreted and enforced, ensuring that the parties understand the legal framework that applies to their agreement.",4
Most Favored Nation Clause,829065c4f5,"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to its conflict or choice of law rules or principles.

Instead, it addresses the governing law of the agreement, specifying that it will be governed by the laws of the State of New York and the State of California, while excluding certain legal principles.

A Most Favored Nation clause is typically included in contracts to ensure that one party receives terms that are at least as favorable as those offered to any other party in similar circumstances. This clause is often used in trade agreements, licensing agreements, and other commercial contracts to protect the interests of one party by ensuring they are not disadvantaged compared to others.

To connect the governing law clause to an MFN clause, one could consider the implications of the chosen governing law on the enforcement and interpretation of the MFN clause. For example, if a dispute arises regarding the MFN clause, the governing law specified in the agreement (New York or California law) would dictate how that clause is interpreted and enforced.

In summary, while the clause you provided does not mention a Most Favored Nation clause, understanding the governing law is important for interpreting any contractual provisions, including an MFN clause, should it be included elsewhere in the agreement.",4

Instead, it addresses the governing law and jurisdiction for disputes arising from the agreement. 

A Most Favored Nation clause is typically included in contracts to ensure that one party receives terms that are at least as favorable as those offered to any other party. This means that if the party offering the MFN clause provides better terms to another party, the party with the MFN clause is entitled to those same better terms.

In contrast, the clause you shared specifies that any legal disputes will be governed by the laws of North Carolina and that the courts in that state will have jurisdiction. This is important for determining where and how legal disputes will be resolved, but it does not address the pricing or terms of the agreement in relation to other parties, which is the essence of an MFN clause.

In summary, while the clause you provided is important for establishing legal jurisdiction and governing law, it does not pertain to the concept of a Most Favored Nation clause. If you are looking to include an MFN clause in your agreement, you would need to draft a separate provision that explicitly outlines the terms and conditions of that clause.",4

This means that if the party providing the benefits to the other party offers better terms to another party, the first party must extend those same better terms to the party with the MFN clause.

Here are the key points that illustrate its relevance:

1. **Termination Rights**: The clause specifies that the Customer has the right to terminate the agreement or any Facility Addendum, which is a fundamental aspect of a ""Termination for Convenience"" provision. This allows the Customer to exit the agreement without needing to provide a specific reason, as long as they follow the outlined procedures.

2. **Inventory and Business Continuity**: Upon termination, the Manufacturer is required to provide sufficient inventory of the terminated Product to ensure business continuity. This reflects the Customer's need to maintain operations even after the termination, which is a common concern in termination scenarios.

3. **Purchase of Work in Process and Product Materials**: The clause allows the Customer to purchase any work in process and Product Materials that were exclusively purchased for them. This provision ensures that the Customer can secure necessary resources even after the termination, which is a critical aspect of managing the transition.

4. **Disposal of Quarantined Products**: The clause outlines the responsibilities regarding any quarantined products at the time of termination, including who bears the cost of disposal. This is important for clarifying liabilities and responsibilities post-termination.

6. **Notification of Facility Disposition**: The Manufacturer is required to notify the Customer of any facility dispositions, which could impact the Customer's decision to terminate. This transparency is crucial for the Customer to make informed decisions regarding the continuation or termination of the agreement.

7. **Assignment of Contracts and Licenses**: The clause also addresses the potential need for the Manufacturer to assist in the assignment of material contracts and licenses upon termination, which can be vital for the Customer to continue operations without interruption.

Overall, this clause provides a comprehensive framework for the rights and obligations of both parties in the event of a termination for convenience, ensuring that the Customer's interests are protected and that there is a clear process for managing the aftermath of such a termination.",5

Here are the key points that illustrate its relevance:

1. **Termination Rights**: The clause specifies that the Customer has the right to terminate the agreement or any Facility Addendum, which is a fundamental aspect of a ""Termination for Convenience"" provision. This allows the Customer to exit the agreement without needing to provide a specific reason, as long as they follow the outlined procedures.

2. **Inventory Management**: Upon termination, the Manufacturer is required to provide sufficient inventory of the terminated Product to ensure business continuity. This reflects the Customer's need to manage their operations smoothly even after termination, which is a common concern in termination for convenience scenarios.

3. **Purchase of Work in Process**: The clause allows the Customer to purchase any work in process and/or Product Materials that were exclusively purchased for them. This provision ensures that the Customer can retain necessary materials and resources, which is often a critical consideration in termination for convenience situations.

4. **Disposal of Quarantined Products**: The clause addresses the handling of any quarantined products at the time of termination, specifying responsibilities for disposal or destruction. This is important for managing liabilities and costs associated with terminated products.

5. **Technical Support**: The clause includes provisions for ongoing technical support during the transition period after termination, which is essential for the Customer to ensure a smooth transfer of production to another supplier or facility.

6. **Notification and Cooperation**: The Manufacturer is required to notify the Customer of any significant changes (like Facility Dispositions) that could affect the agreement, and both parties are expected to cooperate in facilitating the transition. This is crucial for minimizing disruptions during the termination process.

Overall, the clause provides a comprehensive framework for how the termination for convenience will be handled, detailing the rights and responsibilities of both parties, which is essential for ensuring clarity and reducing potential disputes during the termination process.",5
Termination for Convenience,0323b9143c,"Except as agreed by the Parties in writing or as otherwise stated in the Exhibits, Company may terminate for convenience any Transition Service, and RGHI may terminate for convenience any Reverse Transition Service, upon 30 days' prior written notice of such termination; provided, (a) that, with respect to the Services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A, unless otherwise indicated therein, those Services may not be terminated independently except in accordance with an agreed Migration Plan and, (b) any unamortized costs associated with Provider's purchase of any license or other costs incurred specifically for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder will be passed through to the Terminating Party.","The clause you provided outlines the conditions under which either party (the Company or RGHI) can terminate certain services for convenience. This is directly relevant to the query about ""Termination for Convenience"" because it specifies the rights and procedures for such termination.

Here’s a breakdown of the relevance:

1. **Right to Terminate for Convenience**: The clause explicitly grants both the Company and RGHI the right to terminate specific services without cause, which is the essence of a ""Termination for Convenience"" provision. This means that either party can end the agreement for any reason, as long as they provide the required notice.

2. **Notice Requirement**: The clause stipulates that a 30-day prior written notice must be given before termination can take effect. This is a common requirement in termination for convenience clauses, ensuring that the other party has adequate time to prepare for the termination.

3. **Specific Conditions**: The clause includes specific conditions regarding the termination of services described in Section G1 of Exhibit A. It states that these services cannot be terminated independently unless in accordance with an agreed Migration Plan. This adds a layer of complexity to the termination process, indicating that not all services are subject to termination for convenience in the same way.

4. **Financial Implications**: The clause also addresses the financial consequences of termination, stating that any unamortized costs related to licenses or other expenses incurred specifically for providing the services will be passed through to the terminating party. This is important for understanding the financial obligations that may arise from exercising the termination right.

In summary, this clause is a clear articulation of the termination for convenience rights of the parties involved, detailing the process, conditions, and financial implications associated with such a termination.",5
Termination for Convenience,494bebe771,"Customer acknowledges that the Termination for Convenience Fee and the Termination for Cause Fee are each a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty. If M&I terminates this Agreement following an Event of Default on the part of Customer, or if Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1 above without complying with the notification requirements set forth in Section 11.1, then Customer shall pay M&I a termination fee (""Termination for Cause Fee"") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value, payable as set forth in Section 11.1 above. Customer may terminate this Agreement during the Term upon at least one (1) years' written notice to M&I, provided that Customer pays M&I an early termination fee (""Termination for Convenience Fee"") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query regarding ""Termination for Convenience"" because it outlines the conditions and consequences associated with the termination of the agreement by the Customer for convenience.

1. **Definition of Termination for Convenience**: The clause specifies that the Customer has the right to terminate the agreement during its term by providing at least one year's written notice to M&I. This is the essence of a ""Termination for Convenience"" provision, which allows a party to exit the contract without needing to provide a specific reason.

2. **Termination for Convenience Fee**: The clause also introduces the concept of a ""Termination for Convenience Fee,"" which the Customer must pay to M&I upon exercising this right. This fee is described as a reasonable approximation of damages and is categorized as liquidated damages rather than a penalty. This is important because it clarifies that the fee is pre-determined and agreed upon by both parties, which is a common practice in contracts to avoid disputes over damages.

3. **Comparison with Termination for Cause**: The clause contrasts the ""Termination for Convenience Fee"" with the ""Termination for Cause Fee."" The latter applies if the Customer terminates the agreement due to an Event of Default by M&I or fails to comply with notification requirements. This distinction is crucial as it sets different conditions and financial implications for the Customer depending on the nature of the termination.

4. **Financial Implications**: The clause indicates that both termination fees are based on the ""Estimated Remaining Value,"" which suggests that the financial impact of terminating the agreement is calculated based on the expected value of the contract at the time of termination. This provides clarity on the financial obligations of the Customer in both scenarios.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it defines the process and financial consequences of terminating the agreement for convenience, ensuring that both parties understand their rights and obligations in such an event.",5

Here’s how it relates:

1. **Time Limitation**: The clause specifies a time frame of two (2) years during which the individual (referred to as ""you"") agrees not to engage in any competitive business after the transfer of the franchise. This clearly establishes the temporal aspect of the non-compete agreement, indicating that the restriction is not indefinite but rather limited to a specific duration.

2. **Territorial Limitation**: The clause also defines a geographical scope, stating that the individual cannot engage in competitive business activities within twenty-five (25) miles of their Franchise Premises or any other franchise location of The Joint Corp. This territorial restriction is crucial as it delineates the area in which the non-compete is enforceable, ensuring that the individual cannot operate a similar business within a defined radius of the franchise locations.

3. **Scope of Activities**: The clause further elaborates on the types of activities that are restricted, including performing services for or having any interest in businesses that offer products or services similar to those of The Joint Corp. This broadens the understanding of what constitutes competition and reinforces the intent of the non-compete agreement.

4. **Parties Involved**: The clause extends the non-compete obligations not only to the individual but also to Principal Owners and their immediate family members. This indicates that the restrictions are meant to cover a wider network of individuals associated with the franchise, thereby enhancing the protective measures for the business.

In summary, this clause effectively encapsulates the key elements of a non-compete agreement by specifying both the time and territorial limitations, as well as the scope of restricted activities and the parties involved. This makes it a clear example of how non-compete agreements are structured to protect business interests within defined parameters.",5

1. **Time Bound**: The clause specifies a clear time frame for the non-compete obligations. It states that the Non-Compete Period begins on the Effective Date and lasts for two years after the Closing Date. This establishes a defined duration during which the parties are restricted from engaging in competitive activities.

2. **Territorial Boundaries**: The clause indicates that the non-compete obligations apply ""anywhere in the world, excluding India."" This means that while the parties are restricted from competing globally, they are allowed to operate in India without violating the non-compete agreement. This territorial limitation is crucial as it defines the geographical scope of the restrictions.

3. **Scope of Competition**: The clause outlines specific activities that are prohibited during the Non-Compete Period, such as owning, managing, operating, or controlling any business that competes with the Combined Business. It also prohibits becoming a shareholder or partner in any competing entity. This clearly delineates what constitutes competition and helps prevent ambiguity regarding what actions would violate the non-compete agreement.

Here’s how it relates to your query:

1. **Time Bound**: The clause specifies a ""Restricted Period"" during which the individual (the employee or contractor) agrees not to engage in competitive activities. This means that for a defined duration after their employment or engagement with the Company ends, they are restricted from competing in ways outlined in the clause. The specific duration of the ""Restricted Period"" is not mentioned in the excerpt, but it is a critical aspect of non-compete agreements, as it limits the time frame during which the individual must refrain from competing.

2. **Territory Bound**: The clause also defines a ""Restricted Territory,"" which is the geographical area where the individual is prohibited from competing with the Company or any Group Company. This territorial restriction is important as it delineates the scope of the non-compete obligation, ensuring that the individual cannot engage in competitive activities within a specified area that could harm the Company's business interests.

3. **Scope of Competition**: The clause outlines various activities that are considered competitive, including direct employment with competitors, transacting business with restricted customers, soliciting customers, and enticing away employees. This broad definition helps protect the Company's interests by preventing the individual from leveraging their knowledge and relationships gained during their employment to benefit a competitor.

4. **Specific Prohibitions**: The clause includes specific prohibitions against soliciting customers or employees and using the Company's name or similar names in business activities. This further reinforces the Company's position by preventing any potential confusion or direct competition that could arise from the individual's actions.

5. **Consent for Other Business Activities**: The clause also mentions that the individual may not engage in other business activities without the Company's prior written consent, which adds another layer of control over the individual's post-employment activities.

Non-compete bound by time and territory,82f2738b5e,"If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory. If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory.","The clause you provided relates to the concept of exclusivity in distribution agreements, which can be tied to non-compete provisions in certain contexts. Here’s how it connects to the query regarding non-compete agreements bound by time and territory:

1. **Exclusivity and Non-Compete**: The clause establishes a framework for exclusivity between Hydraspin and the Distributor. If Hydraspin decides to enter a new territory, it must first offer the Distributor the opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for that territory. This exclusivity can function similarly to a non-compete agreement, as it restricts Hydraspin from appointing other distributors in that territory if the Distributor accepts the offer.

2. **Time Limitation**: The clause specifies a time frame of ten (10) business days for the parties to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity. This time-bound aspect is crucial in non-compete agreements, as they often include specific durations during which the restrictions apply. In this case, if the parties do not agree within the specified time, Hydraspin is not obligated to contract with the Distributor, which could potentially allow Hydraspin to seek other distributors without violating a non-compete.

3. **Territorial Limitation**: The clause explicitly mentions ""new territory in the United States,"" indicating that the exclusivity (and by extension, any non-compete implications) is geographically limited. Non-compete agreements often specify the geographic area in which the restrictions apply, and this clause mirrors that by defining the territory in which the Distributor may have exclusive rights.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly state a non-compete agreement, it establishes conditions that create exclusivity for the Distributor in a defined territory and time frame, which are key elements often found in non-compete clauses. This can help protect the interests of both parties in terms of market competition and distribution rights.",4
Non-compete bound by time and territory,fced2d8f9c,"If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity within ten (10) business days of the date the opportunity is presented to Distributor, Hydraspin shall have no obligation to enter into a contract with Distributor regarding the new territory.<omitted>If Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, Hydraspin will offer Distributor the first opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for the new territory.","The clause you provided relates to the concept of exclusivity in distribution agreements, which can be closely tied to non-compete agreements, particularly in terms of time and territory.

1. **Time**: The clause specifies a time frame of ten (10) business days for the parties to reach an agreement on exclusivity. This time limitation is relevant because it sets a deadline for negotiations, which can impact the enforceability of any non-compete provisions. If the parties do not reach an agreement within this period, Hydraspin is not obligated to enter into a contract with the Distributor for the new territory. This means that the Distributor's exclusivity (and any associated non-compete obligations) is contingent upon timely negotiations.

2. **Territory**: The clause explicitly mentions that if Hydraspin desires to enter a new territory in the United States, it must first offer the Distributor the opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for that territory. This aspect is crucial for non-compete considerations because it defines the geographical limits within which the Distributor may operate. If the Distributor is granted exclusivity in a specific territory, it may be bound by a non-compete clause that restricts them from engaging in similar business activities outside that territory or with competing products.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query about non-compete agreements as it outlines the conditions under which exclusivity is granted, including the time frame for negotiations and the territorial scope of the Distributor's rights. These factors are essential in determining the enforceability and scope of any non-compete obligations that may arise from the distribution agreement.",4

Here’s how it relates to your query:

1. **Governing Law**: The clause specifies that the agreement will be governed by the internal laws of a particular state (indicated by [***]). This is crucial because the laws of different jurisdictions can vary significantly regarding exclusivity agreements. Understanding which state's laws apply will help determine how exclusivity is defined, enforced, and interpreted.

2. **Exclusivity**: Exclusivity agreements often include terms that specify the duration (time) and geographical scope (territory) of the exclusivity. The governing law will dictate how these terms are interpreted. For example, some jurisdictions may have specific requirements for the enforceability of exclusivity clauses, including limitations on duration or territorial restrictions.

3. **Statutes of Limitation**: The clause mentions that the agreement will be subject to the statutes of limitation of the chosen state. This is relevant because it affects how long parties have to enforce their rights under the exclusivity agreement. If a party believes that the exclusivity has been violated, they must act within the time frame set by the applicable state law.

4. **Conflict of Law Principles**: The clause states that it will not give effect to conflict of law principles. This means that the parties have agreed to adhere strictly to the laws of the chosen state, without considering laws from other jurisdictions that might otherwise apply. This can impact how exclusivity is enforced if the parties are located in different states or if the agreement is executed in multiple jurisdictions.

2. **Dispute Resolution**: If a dispute arises regarding the exclusivity terms, such as whether one party has violated the exclusivity agreement or whether the terms are enforceable, the parties will need to refer to New York law to resolve these issues. This can affect how exclusivity is defined and enforced, including any limitations on duration or geographic scope.

3. **Legal Precedents**: New York has a well-developed body of case law regarding contracts, including exclusivity agreements. The interpretation of exclusivity clauses may vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another, so specifying New York law provides clarity on how such clauses are likely to be interpreted based on existing legal precedents.

4. **Choice of Law Principles**: The clause explicitly states that it does not allow for the application of laws from other states, which could have different rules regarding exclusivity.

This can affect the legal strategies employed by the parties, as different jurisdictions may have different interpretations of exclusivity agreements.

3. **Choice of Law Principles**: The clause explicitly states that it will not give effect to any choice of law principles that might lead to the application of laws from other jurisdictions. This reinforces the exclusivity of New York law in interpreting the Agreement, which can be particularly important if the parties are located in different states or countries, as it ensures a consistent legal framework for the exclusivity terms.

The clause indicates that if the agreement is terminated under certain conditions, the exclusivity (or the restrictions on competing products) will continue to be enforced for a defined period (the Tail Period). This is a common feature in exclusivity agreements, where the obligations may extend beyond the termination of the main agreement.

3. **Territorial Scope**: The term ""Territory"" indicates that the exclusivity is geographically limited. This means that Valeant and its affiliates are only restricted from competing in certain areas, which is a typical characteristic of exclusivity clauses that define where the exclusivity applies.

4. **Consequences of Termination**: The clause outlines the consequences of termination by Dova, specifically how it affects the Tail Period and the obligations of Valeant and its affiliates. This is important for understanding how the exclusivity arrangement is maintained or altered in the event of a contract termination.

This can affect how courts interpret the terms of exclusivity, including any limitations on duration (time) and geographic scope (territory).

3. **Statute of Limitations**: The clause mentions that the statute of limitations or other limitations periods applicable to claims will be governed by Israeli law. This is relevant to exclusivity because if a party believes that the exclusivity terms have been breached, they must be aware of the time limits for bringing a claim under Israeli law.

4. **Conflict of Laws**: By stating that the agreement will not give effect to any choice or conflict of law provisions that would apply laws from other jurisdictions, the clause reinforces that the exclusivity terms will be interpreted solely under Israeli law. This is significant for parties operating in multiple jurisdictions, as it clarifies that they cannot rely on laws from other regions that might be more favorable to their position regarding exclusivity.

In summary, while the clause does not directly address exclusivity bound by time and territory, it sets the legal framework within which such exclusivity terms will be interpreted and enforced, making it highly relevant to any disputes that may arise concerning those terms.",4
No-Solicit of Customers,87addb8ad7,"Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations).","The clause you provided pertains to a ""no-solicit"" agreement between two parties, specifically SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings. While the clause explicitly addresses the solicitation or hiring of employees, it is relevant to your query about the solicitation of customers in the following ways:

1. **Scope of Non-Solicitation**: Although the clause specifically mentions employees, it establishes a framework for non-solicitation agreements. This framework can often be extended to include customers, as similar principles apply. Non-solicitation clauses are designed to protect the business interests of each party by preventing the other from poaching key resources, whether they be employees or customers.

2. **Business Relationships**: The rationale behind non-solicitation clauses is to maintain the integrity of business relationships. If one party is restricted from soliciting the other’s employees, it implies a mutual respect for the business ecosystem, which can also extend to customer relationships. If one party were to solicit the other’s customers, it could undermine the trust and business stability that the agreement seeks to protect.

3. **General Solicitations**: The clause includes a provision that allows for general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed at the other party's employees. This concept can similarly apply to customers. If a party were to engage in general marketing efforts that are not targeted at the other party's customers, it may not be considered a violation of a no-solicit agreement.

4. **Potential for Similar Clauses**: In contracts, it is common to see similar no-solicitation clauses that specifically address customers. If the parties are concerned about customer relationships, they may want to include a separate clause that explicitly prohibits soliciting or engaging with each other's customers during and after the term of the agreement.

In summary, while the clause you provided does not directly address the solicitation of customers, it establishes a precedent for non-solicitation agreements and highlights the importance of protecting business relationships, which can be relevant when considering customer solicitation as well. If customer protection is a concern, it may be advisable to include a specific no-solicit clause for customers in the agreement.",4
No-Solicit of Customers,77df66b5ca,"Each Party agrees that, during the [***] ([***]) [***] period starting from the Effective Date, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates or otherwise induce or attempt to induce such employees to terminate their employment with such other Party or such other Party's Affiliates; provided, however, that general public solicitations and advertisements not directed at employees of the other Party, and the extension of offers to persons who respond to such general solicitations and advertisements, will not be deemed violations of this provision.","The clause you provided is a ""No-Solicit of Customers"" clause, which is relevant to the query as it outlines the restrictions placed on each party regarding the solicitation of employees from the other party or its affiliates. 

Here's how the clause is relevant:

1. **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this clause is to protect each party's workforce from being poached by the other party. This is particularly important in business relationships where both parties may have access to sensitive information, trade secrets, or proprietary knowledge about their employees.

2. **Time Frame**: The clause specifies a defined period (indicated by [***]) during which the no-solicitation obligation is in effect. This creates a clear timeframe for the parties to adhere to, ensuring that the protection is not indefinite but rather limited to a reasonable duration.

3. **Scope of Prohibition**: The clause explicitly prohibits direct or indirect solicitation of employees, which includes any attempts to induce employees to leave their current employment. This broad language helps to cover various forms of solicitation, ensuring that both parties are protected from potential recruitment tactics.

4. **Exceptions**: The clause includes an important exception for general public solicitations and advertisements. This means that if a party advertises job openings publicly and individuals respond to those advertisements, it does not constitute a violation of the no-solicitation clause. This allows for normal hiring practices while still protecting against targeted recruitment of the other party's employees.

5. **Relevance to Business Relationships**: In many business agreements, especially in partnerships or collaborations, the risk of employee poaching can be a significant concern. This clause helps to mitigate that risk, fostering a more stable working relationship between the parties involved.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it establishes clear guidelines and restrictions regarding the solicitation of employees, thereby protecting the interests of both parties in the context of their business relationship.",5
No-Solicit of Customers,0b81bda9eb,"Consultant will not, during the Term, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, directly or indirectly:<omitted>(ii) solicit, participate in or promote the solicitation of any of the Company's clients, customers, or prospective customers with whom Consultant had a Material Contact (hereinafter defined) and/or regarding whom Consultant received Confidential Information, for the purpose of providing products or services (""Competitive Products/Services"").","The clause you provided is a non-solicitation provision that specifically addresses the Consultant's obligations regarding the Company's clients, customers, and prospective customers. Here’s how it is relevant to your query about the ""No-Solicit of Customers"":

1. **Purpose of the Clause**: The clause is designed to protect the Company's business interests by preventing the Consultant from soliciting its clients or customers for a specified period (during the term of the agreement and for one year thereafter). This is crucial for maintaining the Company's relationships and preventing potential loss of business.

2. **Definition of Material Contact**: The clause mentions ""Material Contact,"" which likely refers to any significant interaction the Consultant had with the Company's clients or customers. This definition is important because it delineates the scope of the Consultant's obligations. If the Consultant had meaningful interactions with certain clients, they are restricted from soliciting those clients.

3. **Confidential Information**: The clause also references ""Confidential Information,"" indicating that if the Consultant received sensitive information about the Company's clients or customers, they are further restricted from soliciting those entities. This reinforces the idea that the Consultant should not leverage any inside knowledge gained during their engagement with the Company to benefit themselves or a competitor.

4. **Competitive Products/Services**: The clause specifies that the prohibition on solicitation applies to the provision of ""Competitive Products/Services."" This means that the Consultant cannot engage in activities that would directly compete with the Company’s offerings, further protecting the Company’s market position.

5. **Duration of Restriction**: The one-year duration after the termination of the agreement is a common timeframe for non-solicitation clauses, providing a reasonable period for the Company to maintain its client relationships without interference from the Consultant.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it outlines the Consultant's obligations not to solicit the Company's customers, thereby safeguarding the Company's business interests and client relationships during and after the term of the agreement.",5

Here’s how it is relevant to the query about the ""No-Solicit of Customers"":

1. **Scope of Solicitation**: The clause outlines the conditions under which the Distributor is allowed to solicit customers. It specifies that the Distributor can market and solicit customers outside the defined Territory, but with certain limitations.

2. **Exclusivity Considerations**: The clause emphasizes that the Distributor must refrain from solicitation activities in any territory where Hydraspin has an exclusive agreement with another distributor. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of those exclusive agreements and ensuring that the rights of the third-party distributor are respected.

3. **Notification Requirement**: Hydraspin is required to notify the Distributor in writing about any exclusive arrangements with other distributors and the specific territories affected. This notification is essential for the Distributor to understand where they are restricted from soliciting customers, thereby preventing potential legal disputes or breaches of contract.

4. **Legal Protection**: By including this clause, both parties are protected. Hydraspin ensures that its exclusive distribution agreements are honored, while the Distributor is informed of the boundaries within which they can operate without infringing on those agreements.

1. **Non-Solicitation Period**: The clause establishes a ""Non-Solicit Period"" of three years after the Closing Date during which Sellers are prohibited from inducing or soliciting employees of the Combined Business. This is relevant because similar principles can apply to customers; if Sellers are restricted from soliciting employees, they may also be restricted from soliciting customers to protect the business interests of the Buyer.

2. **Direct and Indirect Solicitation**: The clause specifies that Sellers cannot directly or indirectly induce or solicit employees. This language can be interpreted to extend to customers as well, suggesting that Sellers must refrain from any actions that could be seen as soliciting customers of the Combined Business during the Non-Solicit Period.

3. **General vs. Targeted Solicitation**: The clause allows for general solicitations through public mediums, which indicates that while there are restrictions, there are also allowances for broader marketing efforts. This distinction is important in understanding how Sellers can engage with the market without violating the non-solicitation terms.

4. **Protection of Business Interests**: The underlying purpose of the clause is to protect the Buyer’s business interests by preventing Sellers from poaching employees and potentially customers, which could harm the Combined Business's operations and relationships.

In summary, while the clause specifically addresses the solicitation of employees, the principles of non-solicitation can be applied to customer relationships as well, ensuring that Sellers do not undermine the Buyer’s business by soliciting its customers during the specified period.",4
No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,77df66b5ca,"Each Party agrees that, during the [***] ([***]) [***] period starting from the Effective Date, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates or otherwise induce or attempt to induce such employees to terminate their employment with such other Party or such other Party's Affiliates; provided, however, that general public solicitations and advertisements not directed at employees of the other Party, and the extension of offers to persons who respond to such general solicitations and advertisements, will not be deemed violations of this provision.","The clause you provided is a non-solicitation agreement that restricts each party from soliciting or inducing employees of the other party to leave their employment for a specified period. Here’s how it relates to your query regarding the time frame and the stipulation of not being bound by time or longer than 12 months:

1. **Time Frame Specification**: The clause explicitly mentions a period starting from the ""Effective Date"" and lasting for a specified duration (indicated by ""[***]""). This is relevant to your query because it implies that there is a defined time limit for the non-solicitation obligation, which is typically a common practice in such agreements.

2. **Limitation on Duration**: Your query suggests a concern about the non-solicitation period not being bound by time or being longer than 12 months. The clause, as it stands, does not specify a duration, which could lead to ambiguity. If the period were to be left open-ended or longer than 12 months, it could potentially be challenged as unreasonable or unenforceable in some jurisdictions. 

3. **General Public Solicitations**: The clause also includes a provision that allows for general public solicitations and advertisements, which means that if a party were to post job openings publicly, it would not be considered a violation of the non-solicitation agreement. This is relevant because it provides a balance, allowing companies to recruit without directly targeting the other party's employees.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the non-solicitation obligations between the parties, specifies a time frame (which needs to be defined), and addresses the issue of general solicitations. If the intention is to ensure that the non-solicitation period is not longer than 12 months, it would be prudent to explicitly state that in the clause to avoid any potential legal challenges.",4
No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,ae1ddd57be,"Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former<omitted>employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period.

It is relevant to your query about a ""No-Solicit Of Employees"" clause that is not bound by time or longer than 12 months for the following reasons:

1. **Duration of Non-Solicit Period**: The clause specifies a ""Non-Solicit Period"" that lasts for three years after the Closing Date. This is significantly longer than the 12-month limit you mentioned in your query. If you are looking for a clause that is not bound by time or is limited to 12 months, this clause does not meet that criterion, as it imposes a three-year restriction.

2. **Scope of Restrictions**: The clause restricts Sellers from inducing or soliciting employees of the Combined Business for a specified period. This aligns with the concept of a ""No-Solicit Of Employees"" clause, but it is important to note that it includes specific exceptions (e.g., soliciting former employees who were terminated at least six months prior).

3. **General Solicitations**: The clause allows for general solicitations through public mediums, which means that Sellers can still engage in broader recruitment efforts that are not specifically targeted at employees of the Combined Business. This aspect may be relevant if you are considering how restrictive the clause is in practice.

4. **Exceptions to the Non-Solicit**: The clause provides exceptions that allow Sellers to solicit former employees under certain conditions. This could be a point of negotiation if you are looking for a more lenient or specific no-solicit clause.

In summary, while the clause is relevant to the concept of a no-solicit agreement, it does not align with your query regarding a clause that is not bound by time or limited to 12 months, as it imposes a three-year restriction. If you are seeking a more flexible or shorter duration for a no-solicit clause, this particular clause would not fulfill that requirement.",4
No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,87addb8ad7,"Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations).","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding a ""No-Solicit of Employees"" provision because it outlines the specific terms under which the parties (SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings) agree not to solicit or hire each other's employees. Here’s how it relates to the query:

1. **Time Limitation**: The clause explicitly states that the no-solicitation agreement is in effect during the term of the agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter. This directly addresses the query's concern about the duration of the no-solicit provision, indicating that it is limited to a maximum of 12 months after the agreement ends.

2. **Scope of Restriction**: The clause specifies that the restriction applies only to direct solicitation or hiring of employees from the other party. It clarifies that general solicitations to the public, which are not specifically aimed at the other party's employees, are exempt from this restriction. This means that while there is a no-solicit provision, it does not prevent either party from engaging in broader recruitment efforts that do not target the other party's employees directly.

3. **Legal Enforceability**: The clause is structured to be legally enforceable, as it clearly defines the parties involved, the nature of the restriction, the duration, and the exceptions. This clarity is important in legal contracts to ensure that both parties understand their obligations and the limitations of the no-solicit agreement.

No-Solicit Of Employees not bound by time or longer than 12 months,a804319d22,"Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the ""Non-Solicit Period""), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business. <omitted>

1. **Duration of Non-Solicit Period**: The clause specifies a Non-Solicit Period of three years after the Closing Date. This is significantly longer than the 12-month maximum you mentioned in your query. If your intention is to limit the non-solicitation period to 12 months, this clause would not meet that requirement.

2. **Time-Bound Restrictions**: The clause explicitly states that the Sellers are restricted for a defined period (three years), which contradicts the notion of not being bound by time. If the goal is to have a no-solicit clause that is not time-bound, this clause would not be suitable as it imposes a clear temporal limitation.

3. **Scope of Restrictions**: The clause outlines specific actions that are prohibited (inducing, soliciting, or recruiting employees) during the Non-Solicit Period. This aligns with the general purpose of a no-solicit clause, which is to protect the business from losing employees to former owners or partners. However, the length of the restriction is a critical factor in its enforceability and reasonableness.

4. **Exceptions**: The clause includes exceptions that allow Sellers to solicit former employees under certain conditions, which may provide some flexibility. However, these exceptions do not alter the overall duration of the non-solicitation period.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a three-year non-solicitation period, which exceeds the 12-month limit you mentioned, and it is explicitly time-bound, contrary to the idea of having no time restrictions.

2. **Scope of the Restriction**: The clause prohibits both direct and indirect solicitation of current or previous employees of the other party. This aligns with the general intent of a no-solicit clause, which is to protect a party's workforce from being poached by the other party.

3. **Condition for Solicitation**: The clause includes a condition that allows solicitation only after a period of sixty months has elapsed since the last employment of the employee by the other party. This adds an additional layer of restriction, further extending the time frame beyond what is typically acceptable in a no-solicit agreement.

4. **Consent Requirement**: The clause requires prior written consent from the other party before soliciting employees, which is a common feature in no-solicit agreements. However, the lengthy duration and the specific conditions make it more restrictive than what your query suggests.

In summary, the clause is relevant as it illustrates a no-solicit provision that is significantly longer than the desired 12-month period and includes additional conditions that may not align with your query's requirements. If the goal is to have a no-solicit clause that is not bound by time or limited to 12 months, this clause would need to be revised to reflect those terms.",4

5. **Legal Compliance**: The clause begins with a reference to compliance with applicable law, indicating that the non-disparagement obligations are subject to legal limitations, which is important for enforceability.

1. **Definition of Non-Disparagement**: The clause explicitly defines what constitutes a ""Disparaging Communication,"" which includes any communication that could negatively affect the perception of the other party or its products, services, or personnel. This aligns with the general purpose of non-disparagement clauses, which is to prevent parties from making negative statements about each other.

2. **Scope and Duration**: The clause specifies that the non-disparagement obligation lasts during the term of the agreement and for two years thereafter. This establishes a clear timeframe during which both parties are expected to refrain from making disparaging remarks, ensuring ongoing protection of each party's reputation even after the contract ends.

3. **Obligation to Prevent Disparagement**: The clause not only binds the parties themselves but also requires them to use reasonable efforts to prevent their employees from making disparaging comments. This extends the responsibility beyond just the parties to include their staff, which is important for comprehensive protection against potential reputational harm.

4. **Limitations on Rights**: The clause includes a provision that clarifies that the non-disparagement obligation does not restrict or impede the exercise of any rights or remedies under the agreement.

1. **Mutual Agreement**: The clause establishes a mutual agreement between the Client and the Designer, indicating that both parties are bound by the same obligations. This ensures that neither party can disparage the other, creating a balanced approach to reputation protection.

2. **Scope of Disparagement**: The clause specifies that disparagement includes not only spoken comments but also written comments, particularly online posts. This broad definition helps cover various forms of communication that could harm a party's reputation.

3. **Protection of Affiliates and Employees**: The clause extends the non-disparagement obligation to include not just the parties themselves but also their affiliates, subsidiaries, and employees. This means that both parties must take reasonable steps to ensure that their employees and agents do not engage in disparaging behavior, further protecting the overall reputation of both parties.

4. **Prohibition of Defamatory Content**: The clause explicitly prohibits posting negative comments on defamatory or review websites, which is particularly relevant in the digital age where online reputation can significantly impact a business.

While it does not explicitly mention non-disparagement, it can be relevant in the context of maintaining a positive relationship between the parties and protecting their reputations.

Here's how it relates to non-disparagement:

1. **Protection of Reputation**: Non-disparagement clauses are often included in contracts to prevent parties from making negative statements about each other. The assignment clause indicates that neither party can transfer their rights or obligations under the agreement without the other's consent. This implies that both parties have a vested interest in maintaining a good relationship and reputation, which aligns with the purpose of a non-disparagement clause.

2. **Consent and Reasonableness**: The clause states that consent for assignment should not be unreasonably withheld. If one party were to disparage the other, it could lead to a breakdown in trust and cooperation, making it more likely that consent would be withheld in future dealings. Thus, maintaining a non-disparagement stance can be seen as a way to ensure smoother interactions and agreements.

3. **Competitor Concerns**: The clause also mentions that withholding consent for assignment to a competitor is deemed reasonable. This highlights the importance of protecting each party's interests and reputation in the marketplace. If one party were to disparage the other, especially in a competitive context, it could harm the latter's standing and business opportunities.

In summary, while the clause does not directly address non-disparagement, it underscores the importance of mutual respect and the protection of each party's reputation, which are key elements of a non-disparagement agreement.",4
Non-Disparagement,0a7a0ec21c,"Neither Party shall do or cause to be done any act or thing that may in any way adversely affect any rights of the other Party in and to such other Party's Marks or any registrations thereof or that, directly or indirectly, may reduce the value of such Marks or detract from any Mark's reputation, including challenging the ownership, validity or enforceability of such Marks.","The clause you provided is relevant to the concept of non-disparagement, as it outlines obligations that both parties have regarding the protection of each other's trademarks (referred to as ""Marks""). Here’s how it connects to the idea of non-disparagement:

1. **Protection of Reputation**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall engage in actions that could adversely affect the rights of the other party in relation to their Marks. This aligns with the principle of non-disparagement, which seeks to prevent parties from making negative statements or taking actions that could harm the reputation of the other party.

2. **Avoiding Adverse Actions**: By prohibiting acts that may reduce the value of the Marks or detract from their reputation, the clause serves to ensure that both parties maintain a level of respect and integrity towards each other's intellectual property. This is a key aspect of non-disparagement, as it aims to foster a positive relationship and avoid any actions that could be seen as disparaging.

3. **Challenging Ownership or Validity**: The clause also addresses the issue of challenging the ownership, validity, or enforceability of the Marks. Such challenges could be considered disparaging actions, as they undermine the other party's rights and could negatively impact their reputation. By including this provision, the clause reinforces the commitment to non-disparagement.

In summary, this clause is relevant to non-disparagement as it establishes a framework for both parties to refrain from actions that could harm each other's trademarks and reputations, thereby promoting a respectful and cooperative relationship.",5

1. **ROFR (Right of First Refusal)**: This gives the Company the right to purchase shares before the Farids Group can sell them to a third party. The clause outlines the process for the Farids Group to notify the Company of a proposed transfer of shares (the ""ROFR Sale Notice"") and the timeline for the Company to respond with a ""ROFR Purchase Notice"" if it wishes to exercise its right.

2. **ROFO (Right of First Offer)**: This allows the Company the opportunity to make an offer to purchase shares before the Farids Group can sell them to others. The clause specifies the requirements for the Farids Group to provide a ""ROFO Sale Notice"" and the conditions under which the Company can respond with a ""ROFO Purchase Notice.""

3. **Rofn**: While ""Rofn"" is not explicitly defined in the clause, it may be a typographical error or shorthand for ""ROFR"" or ""ROFO."" In legal contexts, it is common for abbreviations to be used interchangeably, but clarity is essential.

1. **Definition of ROFR**: The clause explicitly mentions that Calm has a right of first refusal to expand its rights and obligations to any Stores outside the specified Territory.

1. **Definition of Change of Control**: The clause specifies that a ""change of control"" occurs when there is a transfer or assignment of ownership that results in the current common parent company (Reynolds Group Holdings Limited) ceasing to control either the Seller or the Buyer. This definition is crucial because it establishes the circumstances under which a change of control is recognized in the agreement.

2. **Assignment and Consent**: The clause states that a change of control is treated as an assignment that requires consent from the other party.

1. **Definition of Change of Control**: The clause refers to a ""Change of Control Event"" as defined in a specific section (Section 14.5) of the agreement.

Anti-Assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates,2c5e257df7,"Except as otherwise provided herein, a Party shall not have the right to assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether through a merger, sale of stock, or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party; except that, either Party shall be permitted, without any need for the other Party's consent, to assign this Agreement (a) in whole or in part to an Affiliate (provided, however, that once such Person is no longer an Affiliate of the assigning Party, such former Affiliate shall assign this Agreement back to the assigning Party), provided that the assigning Party provides the other Party notice of any such assignment provided further that failure to provide such notice of such assignment shall not render such assignment void; or (b) to a Third Party in connection with sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assigning Party's business or assets relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, whether by Change of Control, merger, sale of assets or otherwise; provided, however, that, with respect to clause (b), (i) any assignment of this Agreement shall be void and have no effect unless and until the assignee assumes the <omitted> obligations of the assigning Party in a written instrument, a copy of which is provided to the other Party; and (ii) any assignment of this Agreement must be accompanied by a simultaneous assignment of the Other Agreements to the same assignee, and the assigning Party's interest in the Purchased Assets to the same assignee unless otherwise agreed by Conformis in advance, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld.","The provided clause contains an anti-assignment provision that specifically addresses the assignment of rights and obligations under the agreement. It is relevant to your query about requiring notice only for assignments to affiliates in the following ways:

1. **General Anti-Assignment Rule**: The clause begins by stating that a party cannot assign its rights or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party. This establishes a general rule against assignment, which is a common feature in contracts to protect the interests of both parties.

2. **Exception for Affiliates**: The clause explicitly allows either party to assign the agreement to an affiliate without needing the other party's consent. This is a significant exception to the general rule, indicating that assignments to affiliates are treated differently and are more permissible.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause requires that the assigning party must provide notice to the other party when an assignment to an affiliate occurs. This notice requirement ensures that the non-assigning party is informed of the assignment, maintaining transparency in the relationship.

4. **Non-voiding of Assignment**: Importantly, the clause states that failure to provide notice does not render the assignment void. This means that even if the assigning party fails to notify the other party, the assignment to the affiliate remains valid. This aspect aligns with your query, as it indicates that the notice requirement is not a strict condition for the validity of the assignment.

5. **Conditions for Other Assignments**: The clause also outlines additional conditions for assignments to third parties, which are more stringent than those for affiliates. This further emphasizes the more lenient treatment of assignments to affiliates compared to other types of assignments.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a framework for assignments, specifically allowing assignments to affiliates with a notice requirement that does not affect the validity of the assignment. This aligns with your request for an anti-assignment clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates.",5

Here’s how it aligns with your request:

1. **General Anti-Assignment Provision**: The clause begins with a general prohibition against assigning rights or obligations under the agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. This establishes a baseline restriction on assignments.

2. **Exception for Affiliates**: The clause explicitly allows either party to assign the agreement to an affiliate without needing the other party's consent. This is a significant exception to the general rule, indicating that assignments to affiliates are treated differently.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause states that the assigning party must provide notice to the other party when an assignment to an affiliate occurs. This aligns with your query, as it specifies that notice is required only for assignments to affiliates, not for other types of assignments.

4. **Non-voiding of Assignment for Lack of Notice**: Importantly, the clause clarifies that failure to provide notice of such an assignment does not render the assignment void. This means that while notice is required, the lack of it does not invalidate the assignment, which further emphasizes the flexibility afforded to assignments to affiliates.

5. **Other Assignments**: The clause also addresses assignments to third parties in connection with the sale or transfer of the assigning party's business or assets, but it imposes stricter conditions on these assignments, such as requiring the assignee to assume obligations and simultaneous assignments of related agreements. This distinction reinforces the more lenient treatment of assignments to affiliates.

2. **Exceptions for Affiliates**: The clause specifically allows a Party to assign its rights and obligations to its Affiliates without needing prior written consent from the other Party. This directly addresses your query by indicating that assignments to affiliates are permitted without the need for consent, which is a common practice in many agreements.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause includes a requirement that each Party must ""promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1."" However, it is important to note that this notice requirement applies to all assignments made under this section, including those to affiliates. This means that while consent is not required for assignments to affiliates, the Party making the assignment must still inform the other Party of the assignment.

In summary, the clause is relevant because it establishes a framework for assignments, specifically allowing assignments to affiliates without prior consent while still requiring notification. If your goal is to have a clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates (and not for other types of assignments), you may need to revise the notice requirement to specify that it applies only to assignments to affiliates.",4

4. **Liability and Obligations**: The clause also stipulates that the assigning Party remains liable for its obligations under the agreement even after assigning to an affiliate. This ensures that the original Party is still accountable, which is a common concern in anti-assignment clauses.

2. **Assignee's Obligations**: It requires that any assignee must expressly assume the obligations of the assignor in writing. This ensures that the new party stepping into the agreement is fully aware of and agrees to the terms.

3. **Consent Requirement**: The clause specifically mentions that Network Affiliate cannot assign or transfer its rights or delegate its duties to any third party without obtaining prior written consent from NCM. This is a broad restriction that applies to all third parties, not just affiliates.

4. **Notice for Affiliates**: While the clause does not explicitly state that notice is only required for assignments to affiliates, it implies that any assignment (including to affiliates) requires prior written consent. If the intent is to allow assignments to affiliates with only notice (rather than consent), the clause would need to be modified to reflect that intention clearly.

This flexibility allows Ginkgo to potentially decrease its minimum purchase obligations if certain conditions are met, which is an important aspect of the commitment.

5. **Binding Nature**: The clause emphasizes that the commitments are binding unless mutually agreed otherwise in writing, reinforcing the seriousness of the minimum purchase obligations.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **Transfer or Assignment Rights**: The clause explicitly states that a party has the right to transfer or assign its rights under the IP Agreement. This is crucial for understanding how ownership of intellectual property can change hands, particularly in the context of business transactions.

2. **Conditions for Transfer**: The clause specifies that such a transfer or assignment is permissible only in connection with significant corporate events, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of the party's assets.

Here's a breakdown of how the clause operates in this context:

1. **Recognition of Legal Limitations**: The clause begins by acknowledging that there may be legal limitations in some jurisdictions that prevent the full assignment of ownership, title, or rights to the Assigned IP as outlined in a previous section (Section 2.1(b)(i)). This is important because it recognizes that not all IP can be freely transferred due to varying laws.

2. **Irrevocable Agreement to Assign Rights**: The clause states that the Seller (and other Seller Parties) irrevocably agrees to assign and transfer all rights that can be assigned under the specified section. This means that to the extent that the law allows, the Seller is committing to transferring as much of the IP rights as possible to the Purchaser Assignees.

3. **Granting of a License**: For any rights that cannot be assigned due to legal restrictions, the clause provides an alternative by granting the Purchaser Assignees a comprehensive license. This license is described as unlimited, exclusive, irrevocable, assignable, transferable, sublicenseable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, and fully paid up. This means that even if ownership cannot be transferred, the Purchaser Assignees still have extensive rights to use, exploit, and commercialize the Assigned IP.

4. **Flexibility and Protection**: By including this clause, the contract ensures that the Purchaser Assignees are not left without rights to the IP simply because of jurisdictional limitations. It provides a mechanism to protect the interests of the Purchaser Assignees and allows them to benefit from the Assigned IP even when full ownership cannot be transferred.

In summary, this clause is crucial for addressing potential legal barriers to IP ownership transfer and ensures that the Purchaser Assignees retain significant rights to use and commercialize the Assigned IP, thereby safeguarding their interests in the transaction.",5

2. **Restrictions on Assignment**: The clause explicitly states that no party can assign or delegate their rights or obligations under the agreement without obtaining prior written consent from the other party. This is significant in IP ownership because it ensures that one party cannot unilaterally transfer their rights to another entity without the agreement of the other party, thereby protecting the interests of both parties in the IP.

3. **Consequences of Unauthorized Transfer**: The clause further clarifies that any attempted transfer that does not comply with this requirement will be considered null and void. This provision serves as a deterrent against unauthorized transfers and reinforces the importance of adhering to the agreed-upon terms regarding IP ownership.

This ensures that the rights and obligations associated with the Licensed IP are preserved even after a transfer, protecting the interests of both parties.

2. **Restrictions on Assignment**: The clause establishes that neither party can assign the IP Agreement or any associated rights, licenses, or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party.

4. **Protection of License Grants**: By requiring that any assignment or transfer is subject to the acknowledgment of the license grants, the clause ensures that the original terms of the license remain intact, thereby protecting the rights of the original licensor (the Seller Parties) and ensuring that the licensee (the Purchaser) continues to operate under the agreed terms.

In summary, this clause provides a framework for how IP ownership can be assigned or transferred while ensuring that the rights and obligations under the original agreement are maintained, thus addressing the query about IP ownership assignment or transfer comprehensively.",5

2. **Automatic Vesting**: The clause acknowledges that there may be situations where the Company IP does not automatically vest in the Company. This is important because it clarifies that the assignment is necessary to ensure that the Company has full ownership of the IP, even if it does not automatically belong to them.

3. **Present Assignment**: The phrase ""by way of a present assignment of all future rights"" indicates that the assignment is not just for existing IP but also covers any future developments or creations related to the Company IP.

   - **Termination of the Agreement**: If Party B terminates the agreement without Party A's consent, Party B must pay an amount equivalent to one month's freight as liquidated damages. This sets a clear expectation for Party B regarding the financial repercussions of such an action.
   - **Parcel Transfer Delays**: If there is a delay in parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle issues, the clause outlines a tiered structure for liquidated damages based on the number of days the delay occurs.

Covenant Not To Sue,f3ceb882eb,"There are no representations, warranties or covenants other than those set forth herein.","The clause you provided, ""There are no representations, warranties or covenants other than those set forth herein,"" is relevant to the concept of a ""Covenant Not To Sue"" in several ways:

1. **Limitation of Claims**: This clause indicates that the parties to the contract are agreeing that the only obligations and promises (covenants) that exist are those explicitly stated in the contract. This means that any claims or legal actions that might arise outside of these specified covenants are not valid. In the context of a Covenant Not To Sue, this reinforces the idea that the parties are limiting their ability to bring legal action against each other based on any representations or promises not included in the contract.

2. **Clarity and Certainty**: By stating that there are no other representations or covenants, the clause provides clarity and certainty to the parties involved. It helps to prevent misunderstandings or disputes about what obligations exist. In a Covenant Not To Sue, this clarity is crucial because it ensures that both parties understand that they cannot pursue legal action based on any claims that are not explicitly covered in the contract.

3. **Enforcement of the Covenant**: If a party were to attempt to sue based on an alleged promise or representation not included in the contract, this clause would serve as a defense against such a lawsuit. It reinforces the enforceability of the Covenant Not To Sue by establishing that the parties have agreed to limit their legal recourse to only what is contained in the contract.

In summary, this clause supports the intent and effectiveness of a Covenant Not To Sue by clearly delineating the boundaries of the parties' legal rights and obligations, thereby minimizing the risk of future litigation based on unexpressed claims.",5

Here's how it is relevant to your query:

1. **Definition of Covenant Not To Sue**: A covenant not to sue is a legal agreement in which one party agrees not to initiate legal action against another party for certain claims or issues. In this case, the covenant pertains to patent infringement claims.

2. **Scope of the Covenant**: The clause explicitly states that each party agrees not to sue the other (and specified related entities) for patent infringement related to future patents or patent rights concerning the ""Developments"" that either party owns or controls. This means that if one party develops new technology or improvements, they cannot sue the other party for infringing on any patents that may arise from those developments, provided certain conditions are met.

3. **Protected Entities**: The clause identifies ""Protected Entities,"" which include the parties' officers, directors, successors, assigns, licensees, customers, and distributors. This broadens the protection against lawsuits, ensuring that not only the parties to the agreement but also their affiliates and business partners are shielded from patent infringement claims.

4. **Condition of Licensing**: The covenant is conditioned on the Protected Entities having a license from either Commerce One or Corio to use the Software or any related products. This means that the protection against lawsuits is only applicable if the Protected Entities are properly licensed, which encourages compliance with licensing agreements.

5. **Future Patents**: By addressing future patents and patent rights, the clause anticipates potential developments and innovations that may arise after the agreement is made, thus providing ongoing protection against litigation related to those future developments.

The liquidated damages amount is set at 30% of Party A's share of revenues, which serves as a pre-determined compensation for the breach.

This clause is relevant because it provides a clear remedy for Party A in the event of a breach, reinforcing the seriousness of the covenant not to sue. It serves as a deterrent against potential breaches by Party B, as they would face financial consequences if they fail to adhere to the covenant.

1. **Binding Nature**: The clause states that all covenants and agreements are binding on the parties and their successors and assigns. If a ""Covenant Not To Sue"" is included in the agreement, it would be enforceable against the parties and their successors. This means that if one party agrees not to sue the other, that obligation would extend to any future parties that may take over the rights or obligations of the original parties.

2. **No Assignment of Rights**: The clause also indicates that nothing in the agreement allows a party to assign its rights or obligations without consent. This is important for a ""Covenant Not To Sue"" because it implies that the party who has agreed not to sue cannot transfer that obligation to another party without the other party's consent. This ensures that the original intent of the covenant is preserved and that the parties involved are clear about who is bound by the covenant.

1. **Exclusivity of Agreements**: The clause states that there are no other covenants, promises, or agreements outside of what is explicitly included in the contract.

Any informal or verbal agreements made prior to or outside of this contract would not be recognized.

2. **Modification Requirements**: The clause also specifies that any changes to the agreement must be in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. This is particularly important for a ""Covenant Not To Sue,"" as it ensures that if either party wishes to modify or revoke this covenant, they must do so formally. This protects both parties by preventing any misunderstandings or disputes about the terms of the covenant.

3. **Legal Clarity**: By clearly stating that no other agreements exist, the clause helps to avoid ambiguity regarding the parties' intentions. If a ""Covenant Not To Sue"" is included, it clarifies that the parties have agreed not to pursue legal action against each other for certain matters, and this understanding is protected by the requirement for written modifications.

1. **Definition of Third-Party Beneficiary**: A third-party beneficiary is an individual or entity that is not a party to a contract but stands to benefit from its execution. Typically, such beneficiaries can enforce the contract if it was intended for their benefit.

2. **Exclusion of Third-Party Beneficiaries**: The clause explicitly states that there are no third-party beneficiaries under the agreement, which means that only the parties directly involved in the contract have rights and obligations under it. This is a common provision to limit the scope of who can claim benefits or enforce the contract.

3. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause makes an exception for third parties that are indemnified under Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance). This means that while the general rule is that no third parties can enforce the agreement, those specifically mentioned in the indemnification provisions may have some rights related to indemnification.

4. **Limitation on Enforcement**: Importantly, even for those third parties who are entitled to indemnification, the clause states that they cannot enforce the terms of the indemnification against a party to the agreement. This further limits the rights of third parties, ensuring that the parties to the contract retain control over the enforcement of its terms.

Here's how it relates to your query:

1. **Definition of Third-Party Beneficiary**: A third-party beneficiary is a person or entity that is not a party to a contract but may benefit from its execution. In many contracts, parties may intend to confer rights or benefits to third parties, which can lead to legal claims by those third parties if they believe they have been wronged.

2. **Exclusion of Third-Party Beneficiaries**: The clause explicitly states that, except for certain members of each party (which are likely defined elsewhere in the agreement), no other person or entity will be considered a third-party beneficiary. This means that only the parties to the agreement (and specified members) have rights under the contract, and no external parties can claim benefits or enforce any provisions of the agreement.

3. **Legal Implications**: By including this clause, the parties are attempting to limit their liability and obligations to only those who are directly involved in the agreement. It prevents any unintended consequences where a third party might assert rights or claims based on the contract, thereby protecting the parties from potential legal disputes with outsiders.

4. **Clarity and Intent**: This clause clarifies the intent of the parties regarding who can enforce the terms of the agreement. It reinforces that the agreement is meant solely for the benefit of the parties involved and not for any third parties, which is a common practice in contract law to avoid ambiguity.

2. **Rights and Benefits**: By being designated as a third-party beneficiary, ""Ehave"" has the right to enforce certain provisions of the contract or to receive benefits that are intended for them. This means that if the contract is fulfilled as intended, ""Ehave"" can claim the benefits outlined in the agreement.

3. **No Obligations**: The clause also specifies that ""Ehave"" does not have any obligations to the ""End User."" This is significant because it clarifies that while ""Ehave"" can benefit from the contract, they are not responsible for fulfilling any duties or responsibilities that may be imposed on the parties directly involved in the contract. This distinction is important in legal terms, as it limits ""Ehave's"" liability and involvement in the contractual obligations.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query about third-party beneficiaries because it clearly defines ""Ehave's"" role as a beneficiary of the contract while simultaneously absolving them of any obligations, which is a key aspect of third-party beneficiary status.",5

A third-party beneficiary is a person or entity that, while not a party to a contract, stands to benefit from the contract's execution. 

In the clause, ""Lessor and Lessee expressly agree that bw-3 is a third party beneficiary of this Addendum,"" it indicates that the parties to the contract (the Lessor and Lessee) have explicitly recognized bw-3 as a third-party beneficiary.

This implies that they may have rights to enforce certain provisions of the contract or receive benefits from it.

Overall, this clause clarifies the intention of the parties to include specific third parties as beneficiaries of the contract, which is a key aspect of third-party beneficiary law. It establishes that these third parties can potentially claim rights or benefits that arise from the contract, even though they are not directly involved in the agreement between the Lessor and Lessee.",5

Here's how this clause is relevant to the query about a cap on liability:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the total aggregate liability of one party to another for any claims related to breaches of the agreement is capped. This means that if a party breaches the agreement, the other party cannot claim damages beyond a specified limit.

2. **Defined Cap Amount**: The cap is defined as the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products during the twelve months preceding the notification of the claim. This provides a clear and quantifiable limit on potential liability, which helps both parties understand their financial exposure.

3. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply. These exceptions include:
   - Breaches related to unauthorized use of Intellectual Property.
   - Intentional breaches or willful misconduct.
   - Non-compliance with mandatory laws or regulations.
   This means that for these specific types of claims, the parties may be liable for amounts exceeding the cap, which is important for understanding the full scope of liability.

4. **Contextual Relevance**: The clause is relevant in the context of risk management in contractual relationships. By establishing a liability cap, the parties can negotiate and allocate risk more effectively, knowing the maximum financial exposure they face in the event of a breach.

In summary, this clause is a clear articulation of a liability cap, defining both the limit of liability and the circumstances under which that limit applies or does not apply, which is essential for understanding the legal and financial implications of the agreement.",5

AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause you provided, specifically section 11.4 titled ""Limitation of liability,"" directly addresses the concept of a ""cap on liability,"" which is a common provision in contracts that limits the amount one party can be held liable for damages or losses arising from the agreement.

Here's how this clause is relevant to your query:

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a clear monetary limit on the aggregate liability of both Fiserv and the Merchant, setting it at AUD 50,000. This means that, regardless of the circumstances or legal theories involved, neither party can claim damages exceeding this amount for losses related to the agreement.

2. **Scope of Application**: The clause specifies that the Liability Cap applies to losses arising from any cause in connection with the agreement. This broad language indicates that it encompasses various types of claims, whether they are contractual, tortious, or otherwise.

3. **Exceptions to the Cap**: Importantly, the clause outlines two specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply:
   - **Obligation to Remit Proceeds**: Fiserv's responsibility to remit transaction proceeds to the Merchant is not limited by the cap. This means that if there are issues related to the handling of transaction proceeds, Fiserv could be liable for amounts exceeding AUD 50,000.
   - **Merchant’s Payment Obligations**: The Merchant's obligations to pay for services, network security fees, and other amounts due under the agreement are also excluded from the cap. This ensures that the Merchant remains fully liable for these financial obligations, regardless of the cap.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query about a cap on liability as it explicitly defines the limit of liability for both parties while also clarifying the circumstances under which this limit does not apply. This is crucial for understanding the financial exposure and risk management for both Fiserv and the Merchant in their contractual relationship.",5

IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause you provided, titled ""LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,"" is directly relevant to the query regarding a ""cap on liability."" This clause outlines the limitations and caps on the liability of the parties involved in the agreement, specifically addressing the extent to which one party can be held responsible for damages incurred by the other party.

Here are the key points that illustrate its relevance:

1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for lost profits or any consequential, special, incidental, or indirect damages. This means that if one party suffers such damages, they cannot seek compensation from the other party, effectively capping liability for these types of damages.

2. **Limitation on Total Liability**: The clause further specifies that D2's liability is capped at the total amount paid or owed by the Licensee to D2 under the agreement. This establishes a clear financial limit on D2's liability, ensuring that the maximum amount they could be liable for is defined and does not exceed the payments made by the Licensee.

3. **Essential Purpose and Limited Remedies**: The clause also mentions that these limitations apply even if a limited remedy fails to achieve its essential purpose. This reinforces the idea that the liability cap is robust and will hold regardless of the circumstances surrounding the failure of any specific remedy.

In summary, this clause serves to limit the potential financial exposure of the parties involved in the agreement, establishing a clear cap on liability and excluding certain types of damages from being claimed. This is a common practice in contracts to manage risk and provide certainty to the parties regarding their potential liabilities.",5

The relevance to your query about the liability cap being based on the purchase price is clear in the following ways:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the total liability of one party to another for any claims related to breaches of the agreement is capped at the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for Products. This means that if a claim arises, the maximum amount that can be claimed as damages is directly tied to the purchase price of the products involved.

2. **Time Frame for Calculation**: The liability cap is calculated based on the purchase prices paid during the twelve calendar months preceding the notification of the claim. This temporal limitation ensures that the liability is not based on the total purchase price over the entire duration of the agreement but rather on a more recent and relevant period, which can be more reflective of the current business relationship and transactions.

3. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause also outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, such as breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. This means that in cases of serious breaches, the liability may exceed the purchase price cap, which is an important consideration for both parties.

In summary, this clause is directly relevant to your query as it establishes that the liability cap is indeed based on the purchase price, specifically the amounts paid for products in the preceding twelve months, while also detailing the conditions under which this cap applies and the exceptions to it.",5

Specifically, it establishes a cap on the aggregate liability of both parties to AUD 50,000. This means that, regardless of the nature of the claims or the legal theories involved, neither party can be held liable for more than this specified amount in connection with losses arising from the agreement.

In relation to your query about the liability cap being based on the purchase price, it is important to note that the clause does not explicitly tie the liability cap to the purchase price of any goods or services. Instead, it sets a fixed monetary limit (AUD 50,000) on liability, which is independent of the purchase price. 

However, the clause does specify exceptions to the liability cap, indicating that certain obligations, such as Fiserv's duty to remit transaction proceeds and the Merchant's payment obligations, are not subject to this cap. This means that while the liability cap is a fixed amount, it does not limit the parties' responsibilities regarding specific financial obligations that may arise from the agreement.

In summary, while the liability cap is a fixed amount and not directly based on the purchase price, it serves to limit the overall financial exposure of both parties in the event of losses, with certain exceptions that ensure critical obligations are still enforceable regardless of the cap.",4

This is directly relevant to your query about a liability cap based on purchase price.

Here's how the clause relates to your query:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the Dealer's aggregate liability is limited to the unpaid price of the Products. This means that regardless of the nature of the claims (contractual, negligence, strict liability, tort, etc.), the Dealer cannot be held liable for more than the amount that remains unpaid for the Products that are the subject of the claims.

2. **Scope of Claims**: The clause covers ""any and all claims of any kind relating to the Products,"" which indicates that it applies broadly to various types of legal claims. This reinforces the idea that the liability cap is comprehensive and not limited to specific types of claims.

3. **Direct Relation to Claims**: The clause specifies that the liability cap is applicable to claims that ""directly give rise to, or are related to, the claims."" This means that only claims that are directly connected to the Products in question will be subject to this liability cap, ensuring that the Dealer's financial exposure is limited to the value of the Products involved.

In summary, this clause effectively caps the Dealer's liability to the unpaid purchase price of the Products, which aligns with your query about a liability cap based on purchase price.

1. **Scope of Liability**: The clause explicitly limits the types of damages for which either party can be held liable. It excludes consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or enhanced damages, as well as lost profits or revenues. This limitation is significant because it sets a clear boundary on the financial exposure of each party in the event of a breach of the agreement.

2. **Insurance Coverage Considerations**: In many contractual agreements, parties may seek to mitigate their risk through insurance. The limitation of liability clause can influence the type and amount of insurance coverage that parties choose to obtain. For example, if a party knows that its liability is limited to direct damages only, it may opt for a lower level of insurance coverage, as the potential financial exposure is reduced.

3. **Precedents and Case Law**: Legal precedents often address the enforceability of limitation of liability clauses in the context of insurance coverage. Courts may consider whether the limitation of liability is reasonable and whether it aligns with the parties' insurance arrangements. If a party has insurance that covers certain types of damages, it may argue that the limitation of liability should not apply to those damages, especially if the insurance policy provides coverage for losses that would otherwise be excluded under the clause.

4. **Negotiation and Risk Allocation**: The presence of a limitation of liability clause can be a point of negotiation between parties, particularly in relation to insurance. Parties may negotiate the scope of the limitation based on their respective insurance policies and the coverage they have in place. This negotiation can lead to adjustments in the clause to ensure that it aligns with the parties' risk management strategies.

5. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also makes an exception for indemnification obligations related to claims by third parties. This is relevant because insurance coverage often plays a critical role in indemnification scenarios. If a party is required to indemnify another for third-party claims, the availability of insurance coverage can significantly impact the financial implications of that obligation.

In summary, the limitation of liability clause is directly relevant to the query as it establishes the framework for liability between the parties, which is influenced by their respective insurance coverage. The interplay between the clause and insurance considerations can affect risk management, negotiation strategies, and the enforceability of the clause in legal disputes.",4

Specifically, it states that neither party will be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages or lost profits arising from the agreement, except in the event of a breach of Section 11, which pertains to confidential information.

In the context of your query regarding precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability, this clause is relevant for several reasons:

1. **Risk Allocation**: The limitation of liability clause is a common mechanism used in contracts to allocate risk between the parties. By limiting liability, parties can manage their exposure to potential losses, which is often a consideration when determining insurance coverage. Insurers may look at such clauses to assess the risk they are underwriting and to set premiums accordingly.

2. **Insurance Coverage**: If a party is limited in its liability for certain types of damages, it may influence the type and amount of insurance coverage that party seeks. For example, if a party knows it will not be liable for consequential damages, it may opt for a lower level of coverage for those specific risks, potentially affecting the overall insurance strategy.

3. **Precedents and Case Law**: Courts often look at the language of limitation of liability clauses when determining the enforceability of such clauses in the context of insurance claims. If a party attempts to claim damages that are limited by the contract, the court may refer to the limitation of liability clause to decide whether the insurance policy should cover those damages. This can create precedents that influence how similar clauses are interpreted in future cases.

4. **Negotiation of Terms**: The presence of a limitation of liability clause can also influence negotiations between parties regarding insurance. For instance, if one party is willing to accept a broader limitation of liability, the other party may seek to negotiate higher insurance coverage to protect against the risks that remain.

In summary, the limitation of liability clause you provided is relevant to the query as it illustrates how contractual terms can shape the insurance landscape, influence risk management strategies, and potentially affect legal precedents regarding liability and coverage.",4

Nothing in this Section ​8.7 shall operate to limit or exclude any liability under Section ​8.5 [Indemnification] with respect to a Claim, or for fraud, or for breach by a Party of the provisions of Article ​7 [Confidential Information].","The clause you provided, specifically Section 8.7 on Limitation of Liability, is relevant to the query regarding precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability in several ways:

1. **Scope of Liability**: The clause explicitly limits the types of damages for which either party can be held liable. It excludes liability for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential losses, which are often the types of losses that insurance policies may cover. This limitation can influence how parties approach their insurance coverage, as they may seek to ensure that their policies cover the types of risks that are not addressed by the limitation of liability.

2. **Insurance as a Risk Management Tool**: The limitation of liability clause may lead parties to consider their insurance coverage more carefully. If a party knows that their liability is limited under the contract, they may choose to obtain insurance that specifically covers the types of losses that are excluded from liability under the contract. This can create a precedent where parties negotiate their insurance policies in light of the limitations set forth in their contracts.

3. **Indemnification and Liability**: The clause also references indemnification (Section 8.5) and exceptions for fraud and breaches of confidentiality. These exceptions may influence how parties structure their insurance coverage, as they may need to ensure that their insurance policies cover indemnification obligations or specific breaches that are not limited by the liability clause. This interplay can set a precedent for how insurance coverage is tailored to align with contractual limitations.

4. **Legal Precedents**: In legal practice, courts often look at the interplay between limitation of liability clauses and insurance coverage when disputes arise. If a party attempts to claim damages that are limited by the contract, the court may consider whether the party had adequate insurance coverage for those types of losses. This can create a precedent where the adequacy of insurance coverage is evaluated in light of the limitations set forth in the contract.

5. **Negotiation Leverage**: The existence of a limitation of liability clause can also influence negotiations between parties regarding insurance. For example, a party may be more willing to accept a limitation of liability if they have robust insurance coverage that mitigates their risk. This dynamic can set a precedent for how parties negotiate both liability clauses and insurance terms in future contracts.

In summary, the limitation of liability clause is relevant to the query as it establishes a framework that can influence how parties approach their insurance coverage, the types of risks they insure against, and how they negotiate terms in future contracts. It highlights the relationship between contractual liability limitations and the role of insurance in managing those risks.",4

It specifies the types and amounts of insurance coverage that must be maintained, as well as certain endorsements and conditions related to those policies. Here's how this clause is relevant to the query regarding precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability:

1. **Insurance as a Risk Management Tool**: The clause establishes a framework for insurance coverage that serves to mitigate risks associated with the services provided. By requiring the Service Provider to maintain substantial insurance limits (e.g., $5 million for excess liability and $2 million for commercial general liability), the clause effectively sets a financial safety net that can cover potential liabilities arising from the Service Provider's actions or omissions.

2. **Influence on Limitation of Liability**: In many contracts, the limitation of liability clause is influenced by the insurance coverage that the parties agree to maintain. If a Service Provider has significant insurance coverage, it may justify a higher limitation of liability, as the risk of loss is partially transferred to the insurer. Conversely, if the insurance coverage is minimal, the parties may negotiate a lower limitation of liability to reflect the higher risk exposure.

3. **Additional Insureds and Primary Coverage**: The clause specifies that the Owner and other related parties are to be included as additional insureds on the Service Provider's policies. This inclusion can influence the negotiation of liability limits, as it provides the Owner with direct access to the insurance coverage in the event of a claim. The requirement that the Service Provider's insurance is primary to any other insurance maintained by the Owner also indicates a prioritization of coverage that can affect how liability is allocated and limited.

4. **Severability of Interests Clause**: The inclusion of a severability of interests clause means that the insurance policy will respond to claims against the Service Provider without being affected by the actions or negligence of the Owner or other insured parties. This can further influence how liability is limited, as it clarifies that the coverage is robust and independent, potentially allowing for higher limits of liability.

5. **Legal Precedents**: In legal disputes, courts often look at the insurance provisions in contracts to determine the intent of the parties regarding liability. If a contract includes strong insurance requirements, it may be interpreted as an indication that the parties intended to limit liability to the extent of the insurance coverage. This can set a precedent for how similar contracts are interpreted in the future.

In summary, the insurance clause you provided is relevant to the query as it establishes a framework for how insurance coverage can influence the limitation of liability in a contract. It highlights the relationship between risk management through insurance and the allocation of liability between the parties involved.",5
precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability,e156a5b7c4,"28.2. Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The clause you provided, specifically Clause 28.2, outlines the limitations of liability between the parties involved in the agreement. This clause is particularly relevant to your query regarding how insurance coverage can influence the limitation of liability for several reasons:

1. **Scope of Liability**: The clause establishes that, except for personal injury or death caused by negligence (where no limit applies), the liability of either party is capped at the total amount of payments made under the agreement. This means that if a party suffers a loss due to the other party's actions or inactions, their recovery is limited to a predetermined amount, which is often influenced by the insurance coverage that the parties maintain.

2. **Insurance as a Risk Management Tool**: The limitation of liability clause often works in conjunction with insurance policies. Parties may carry insurance to cover potential liabilities that could arise from their contractual obligations. If a party has adequate insurance coverage, they may be more willing to agree to a limitation of liability because they know that their insurance can cover claims up to a certain amount. This can influence negotiations and the final terms of the contract.

3. **Negotiation Leverage**: The presence of insurance can provide leverage during negotiations. For instance, if one party has a robust insurance policy that covers a wide range of liabilities, they may seek to negotiate a higher limitation of liability, knowing that their insurance will cover any claims that exceed that limit. Conversely, a party with less insurance coverage may be more cautious and seek a lower limitation to mitigate their risk.

4. **Legal Precedents**: In legal contexts, courts often look at the relationship between insurance coverage and limitation of liability clauses. If a party has insurance that covers the type of liability being limited, courts may uphold the limitation of liability, recognizing that the party is not left without recourse. Conversely, if a party does not have insurance, courts may scrutinize the limitation more closely, especially in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

5. **Public Policy Considerations**: Courts may also consider public policy when evaluating the enforceability of limitation of liability clauses. If a limitation effectively leaves a party without adequate remedy for significant losses, especially in cases where insurance coverage is insufficient, courts may be inclined to invalidate or modify such clauses.

In summary, Clause 28.2 is relevant to your query as it sets the framework for how liability is limited between the parties, which can be significantly influenced by the insurance coverage they maintain. The interplay between insurance and liability limitations is a critical aspect of contract negotiations and legal interpretations, making it essential to consider both elements when drafting or reviewing contracts.",5

Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause you provided outlines the limitation of liability between Fiserv and the Merchant under the agreement.

This reinforces the idea of a liability cap, ensuring that both parties have a clear understanding of their financial limits in the event of a claim.

3. **Exclusions from Liability Cap**: The clause also outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, such as in cases of gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct, or certain claims related to third-party actions.

2. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause also outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply. These exceptions include breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional misconduct, and non-compliance with mandatory laws. This means that for these types of claims, the parties could be liable for amounts exceeding the cap, which is important for understanding the full scope of liability.

3. **Temporal Limitation**: The clause specifies that the liability cap is based on the amounts paid in the twelve months prior to the claim. This temporal aspect is crucial for determining the cap's applicability and ensuring that it reflects recent financial transactions between the parties.

2. **Specific Mention of Lost Revenue and Profits**: The clause further clarifies that neither party will be liable for ""lost revenue, lost profit or lost savings."" This reinforces the limitation on liability for indirect damages, as these types of losses are often categorized as consequential damages.

3. **Cap on Direct Damages**: While the clause limits liability for indirect damages, it also sets a cap on direct damages. It states that the maximum liability for either party under the agreement cannot exceed the total amounts paid under the agreement in the twelve months preceding the event that gave rise to the claim. This provides a clear financial limit on the liability for direct damages, which is separate from the exclusion of indirect damages.

In summary, this clause effectively caps liability for indirect damages by excluding them entirely, while also placing a limit on direct damages. This is a common practice in contracts to manage risk and protect parties from potentially unlimited liability.",5

1. **Limitation of Liability for Direct Damages**: The clause states that the liability of a party for direct damages is capped at fifteen million dollars. This means that if one party suffers direct damages due to the other party's actions or failures, they cannot claim more than this specified amount.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: The clause further clarifies that neither party will be liable for consequential, incidental, special, or other indirect damages. This includes lost profits and other types of damages that are not directly caused by a breach of the agreement. The language indicates that even if one party is aware that such indirect damages could occur, they are still not liable for them.

3. **Scope of Liability**: The clause also specifies that the limitation on liability does not apply to claims under Section 9 of the agreement or to claims by third parties for injury or damages to persons or tangible property directly caused by any product. This means that while there is a cap on direct damages and an exclusion for indirect damages, there are certain exceptions where liability may still apply.

In summary, this clause effectively limits the potential financial exposure of the parties regarding indirect damages, ensuring that they are not held responsible for losses that are not directly tied to their actions under the agreement.

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This cap is significant because it sets a boundary on the amount that can be claimed for damages, which can include indirect damages.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause specifies certain exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply:
   - **Material Breach of Confidentiality**: If there is a significant breach of confidentiality (as outlined in Section 5), the Liability Cap does not limit the liability for such breaches. This means that if one party fails to protect confidential information, they could be liable for damages beyond the cap.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: The Liability Cap also does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain claims or losses, the cap does not limit the amount they may have to pay.
   - **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: The Liability Cap does not apply in cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This is important because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious wrongdoing simply by relying on the cap.

This cap is significant because it sets a boundary on financial exposure for indirect damages, which are typically harder to quantify and can be substantial.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause specifies certain exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply:
   - **Material Breach of Confidentiality**: If there is a significant breach of confidentiality (as outlined in Section 5), the Liability Cap does not limit the liability for such breaches. This means that if one party fails to protect confidential information, they could be liable for damages beyond the established cap.

3. **Definition of Liability**: The clause defines ""liability"" broadly, encompassing various types of claims and damages, including those arising from contract, tort, equity, and statute.

2. **Types of Damages**: The clause specifies that the parties will not be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages, regardless of the basis for the claim (breach of contract, tort, etc.). This reinforces the limitation on liability for indirect damages, as these types of damages are often considered indirect.

This establishes a cap on liability, ensuring that even for direct damages, the maximum amount recoverable is limited to what has been paid, further emphasizing the limitation on overall liability.

This is particularly relevant to the concept of unilateral liability cap, as it specifies the extent to which one party (in this case, the Distributor) can hold the other party (Accuray) liable for claims arising from breaches of the agreement.

Here’s how the clause relates to the query about unilateral liability cap:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes that the total aggregate liability of one party to the other is capped at a specific amount—namely, the total purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for products in the twelve months preceding the claim. This means that regardless of the nature of the claim, the liability is limited to this defined monetary amount.

2. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause also outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply. These exceptions include breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional misconduct, and non-compliance with mandatory laws. This indicates that while there is a cap on liability for most claims, certain serious breaches can lead to unlimited liability.

3. **Unilateral Nature**: The term ""unilateral"" in the context of a liability cap typically refers to a situation where only one party is subject to the cap, while the other party may not be. In this clause, it appears that the liability cap is applied to the claims made by one party against the other, suggesting a potentially unilateral limitation on liability depending on the context of the agreement.

4. **Risk Management**: By including a liability cap, the parties are managing their risk exposure. The party that is potentially liable (Accuray) is limiting its financial exposure, while the other party (Distributor) is aware of the maximum amount it can recover in the event of a claim.

proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,

failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause you provided outlines a limitation of liability between Fiserv and the Merchant, which is relevant to the concept of a ""unilateral liability cap."" 

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause specifies that both parties' aggregate liability to each other for losses arising from any cause in connection with the Agreement is capped at AUD 50,000. This means that regardless of the circumstances or legal theories involved, neither party can claim more than this amount for damages.

2. **Unilateral Nature**: The term ""unilateral"" typically refers to a situation where one party imposes terms that are not necessarily reciprocal. In this clause, while both parties have a liability cap, the exceptions listed indicate that certain obligations (like Fiserv's obligation to remit transaction proceeds and the Merchant's payment obligations) are not subject to this cap. This creates a scenario where the Merchant may have more exposure to liability than Fiserv, depending on the circumstances.

3. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to:
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds.
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations related to services and regulatory fees.

   This means that while there is a general cap on liability, certain critical financial obligations are exempt from this limitation, which could lead to a situation where one party (in this case, the Merchant) could be liable for amounts exceeding the cap in specific situations.

4. **Relevance to Risk Management**: Understanding this clause is crucial for both parties in assessing their risk exposure. The Merchant needs to be aware that while there is a cap on liability, they may still face significant financial obligations that are not limited by this cap, which could affect their overall risk management strategy.

In this case, the clause specifies that the total aggregate liability of one party to another for any claims related to breaches of the agreement is limited to a specific amount.

2. **Unilateral Nature**: The term ""unilateral"" in your query suggests that one party may be held liable under certain conditions, while the other party's liability is capped or limited. In the provided clause, the liability cap applies to one party's liability to the other, indicating that the liability is not mutual but rather limited to the defined terms for one party (in this case, the Distributor's liability to Accuray).

3. **Exclusions from Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, such as breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional breaches, willful misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. This means that while there is a cap on liability for general claims, certain serious breaches can lead to unlimited liability, which is a common practice in contracts to protect against significant risks.

4. **Practical Implications**: The liability cap provides predictability and limits financial exposure for the parties involved. It is particularly relevant in commercial agreements where one party may want to limit its risk while still being accountable for certain serious breaches.

In summary, the clause establishes a framework for liability between the parties, setting a cap on damages while also outlining exceptions where liability may exceed that cap.

3. **Mutuality**: While the clause specifically mentions the liability of one party to another, it implies a mutual understanding that both parties are subject to the same limitations.

   - The clause specifies that both Fiserv and the Merchant have an aggregate liability limit of AUD 50,000.00. This means that regardless of the circumstances or legal theories involved, neither party can claim more than this amount from the other for losses related to the agreement.
   - The clause also outlines exceptions to this liability cap, indicating that certain obligations (like Fiserv's duty to remit transaction proceeds and the Merchant's payment obligations) are not subject to this limit. This is important because it clarifies that while there is a cap on general liability, specific financial responsibilities remain unaffected.

3. **Relevance to Query**: The clause exemplifies a mutual liability cap by establishing a clear financial limit on liability for both parties. It serves to protect both Fiserv and the Merchant from excessive claims while also delineating specific obligations that fall outside this limitation. This balance is crucial in contractual agreements, as it helps both parties understand their potential financial exposure and the scope of their responsibilities. 

In summary, this clause is a practical application of the mutual liability cap concept, providing a defined limit on liability while also specifying exceptions to that limit.",5
mutual liability cap,0012758249,"Each Party shall obtain and maintain, for the Term (i) commercial general liability insurance with a single combined liability limit of at least $5,000,000 per occurrence, (ii) workers compensation/employer's liability insurance with a liability limit of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence or, if greater, the statutory minimum, and (iii) ""all risk"" property insurance on a replacement cost basis adequate to cover all assets and business interruption Losses that a Party may suffer in connection with or arising out of this Agreement, subject to policy limits, and in the case of the policies described in clause (i) above, naming the other Party as an additional insured thereunder.","The clause you provided outlines the insurance requirements for each party involved in the agreement, specifying the types and minimum limits of insurance coverage that must be maintained throughout the term of the contract. While it does not directly mention a ""mutual liability cap,"" it is relevant to the concept of liability in the context of the agreement.

1. **Liability Coverage**: The clause establishes that each party must carry significant liability insurance (e.g., $5,000,000 for general liability). This indicates that both parties are expected to have financial protection against claims that may arise from their actions or omissions during the term of the agreement.

2. **Risk Mitigation**: By requiring both parties to maintain insurance, the clause helps mitigate the financial risks associated with potential liabilities. This is particularly important in contracts where the parties may be exposed to significant risks, as it ensures that there are resources available to cover claims.

3. **Additional Insured**: The requirement for each party to name the other as an additional insured under their general liability policy further emphasizes the mutual recognition of liability. This means that if one party is sued for an incident related to the agreement, the insurance of the other party can also be accessed to cover the costs, effectively creating a shared liability framework.

4. **Context for Liability Caps**: While the clause does not explicitly set a cap on liability, it establishes a framework for how liability is managed through insurance. In many contracts, a mutual liability cap would be a separate clause that limits the total amount one party can claim from the other. The insurance requirements in this clause could be seen as a way to support or justify the existence of such a cap, as both parties are expected to have adequate coverage to handle claims up to the specified limits.

In summary, while the clause does not directly address a mutual liability cap, it is relevant because it establishes the insurance framework that underpins the parties' liability exposure and risk management strategies within the agreement.",4

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause you provided outlines the limitations of liability between two parties in a contractual agreement, specifically addressing the caps on liability and the types of damages that are excluded. Here's how it relates to your query about two parties having different liability caps and/or carveouts:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for lost profits or any consequential, special, incidental, or indirect damages. This is a common provision in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large claims that could arise from the agreement.

2. **Different Liability Caps**: The clause specifies that ""in no event shall D2's liability hereunder exceed the total amount paid or owed by Licensee to D2 under this Agreement."" This indicates that D2 has a specific cap on its liability, which is tied to the amount the Licensee has paid. If the other party (the Licensee) has a different liability cap or carveout, it would need to be explicitly stated elsewhere in the agreement. The clause as it stands suggests that D2's liability is limited to the payments received, but it does not address the Licensee's liability, which could be higher or lower depending on the terms negotiated.

3. **Carveouts**: The clause does not mention any specific carveouts, which are exceptions to the general limitation of liability. If either party has certain obligations or liabilities that are not subject to the limitations (for example, liabilities arising from gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breaches of confidentiality), those would need to be detailed in separate provisions or clauses in the contract.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a framework for liability limitations between the two parties, but it does not provide information about the Licensee's liability cap or any potential carveouts. For a complete understanding, the contract would need to include corresponding provisions for the Licensee's liabilities and any exceptions to the limitations.",4

1. **General Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for certain types of damages, such as lost profits, lost revenues, or any incidental, indirect, punitive, special, or consequential damages. This sets a baseline for liability, indicating that both parties agree to limit their exposure to certain risks.

2. **Different Liability Caps**: If the parties have different liability caps, this clause can serve as a starting point for negotiations. For instance, one party may want to include a specific cap on direct damages, while the other may want to exclude certain types of damages from the cap. The clause can be modified to reflect these differences, allowing for tailored liability caps that suit each party's risk tolerance.

3. **Carveouts**: The clause can also be adjusted to include carveouts for specific situations where liability may not be limited. For example, one party may want to ensure that liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct is not capped, while the other party may have different concerns. The clause can be amended to specify these carveouts, ensuring that both parties' interests are adequately protected.

4. **Negotiation Tool**: The existence of this clause provides a basis for discussions about liability. Parties can negotiate the specifics of their liability caps and any exceptions to the general limitation of liability, leading to a more customized agreement that reflects their respective needs and concerns.

In summary, the ""Limitation of Liability"" clause is a critical component in addressing the query about differing liability caps and carveouts, as it establishes the initial terms of liability and provides a framework for further negotiation and customization.",4

In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party releases the other Party and waives any right of recovery for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages suffered by such Party regardless of whether any such damages are caused by the other Party's negligence (and regardless of whether such negligence is sole, joint, concurrent, active, passive, or gross negligence), fault, or liability without fault.","The clause you provided, titled ""Limitation of Liability,"" is relevant to the query regarding two parties having different liability caps and/or carveouts because it establishes the framework for how liability is managed between the parties in the agreement. Here’s how it relates:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for certain types of damages (special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages). This is a common provision in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable damages that could arise from breaches or other issues.

2. **Different Liability Caps**: While the clause does not specify different caps for each party, it sets a baseline for liability that could be further defined in the agreement. If the parties wish to have different liability caps, they could modify this clause to include specific caps for each party, thereby tailoring the liability exposure based on their respective roles, risks, or contributions to the agreement.

3. **Carveouts**: The clause does not currently include any carveouts (exceptions to the limitation of liability). However, if one party has specific risks or obligations that warrant a different treatment (for example, liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breaches of confidentiality), these could be added as carveouts to the limitation of liability. This would allow for a more nuanced approach to liability that reflects the specific circumstances of each party.

4. **Mutual Release**: The clause includes a mutual release and waiver of rights to recover certain types of damages, which is important in understanding how liability is shared. If one party has a higher risk exposure or a different liability cap, this mutual release may need to be adjusted to ensure that both parties are adequately protected and that the risks are fairly allocated.

In summary, while the clause provides a general limitation of liability, it can be modified to accommodate different liability caps and carveouts for each party, ensuring that the agreement reflects the specific risk profiles and responsibilities of the parties involved.",4

1. **General Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a general framework for liability between the two parties, stating that neither party will be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages. This is a standard approach to mitigate risk and protect both parties from extensive financial exposure.

2. **Cap on Liability**: The clause specifies that the liability of either party is limited to the amounts to be paid by the client to Excite under the agreement. This indicates that there is a defined cap on liability, which is crucial when negotiating different liability caps for each party. If one party has a higher or lower cap, this clause would need to be adjusted to reflect those differences.

3. **Carveouts**: The mention of ""EXCEPT UNDER SECTIONS 13(a) AND 13(b)"" suggests that there are specific exceptions to the general limitation of liability. These carveouts could pertain to certain types of damages or breaches that are treated differently, allowing for greater liability in those specific circumstances. This is important when negotiating different liability caps, as one party may want to include or exclude certain types of liability from the cap.

4. **Negotiation of Terms**: If the parties have different liability caps, the clause would need to be carefully drafted to ensure that it accurately reflects the agreed-upon terms. For example, one party may agree to a lower cap while the other may negotiate for a higher cap, and the clause would need to clearly delineate these differences.

In summary, this Limitation of Liability clause is relevant to your query as it sets the groundwork for how liability is handled between the parties, including the potential for different caps and specific exceptions (carveouts) that may apply to each party. When negotiating these terms, it is essential to ensure that the clause is tailored to reflect the agreed-upon liability limits and any exceptions that may be necessary for each party.",5

1. **Different Liability Caps**: The clause states that ""Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party."" This indicates that the liability cap is tied to the actual payments made, which could differ between the two parties depending on their respective agreements or transactions. If one party has paid significantly more than the other, their liability cap would be higher, leading to a situation where the parties have different liability caps.

2. **Carveouts**: The clause also references specific sections (19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2), and (b)(iii)(3)) that may provide exceptions to the general limitation of liability. These carveouts could allow for certain types of damages or liabilities to be excluded from the limitations set forth in the clause. If one party has negotiated for more extensive carveouts than the other, this would create a disparity in their respective liabilities.

3. **Direct vs. Indirect Damages**: The clause specifies that neither party will be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages, which further emphasizes the limitation of liability. However, if one party has negotiated for a broader definition of what constitutes direct damages or has specific exclusions from this limitation, it could lead to different liability exposures.

In summary, this clause establishes a baseline for liability that can be modified by specific agreements between the parties, potentially leading to different liability caps and carveouts based on their negotiations and the specific sections referenced.",5

Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause you provided outlines a limitation of liability between Fiserv and the Merchant, specifying a cap on the aggregate liability for losses arising from any cause in connection with the agreement. The key points relevant to your query about a ""cap on liability without carveouts"" are as follows:

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a clear cap on liability, set at AUD 50,000. This means that, in general, neither party can claim more than this amount for losses related to the agreement.

2. **Carveouts**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to certain obligations. These exceptions (or ""carveouts"") include:
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit proceeds from the Merchant’s transactions.
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations related to services, network security fees, and other amounts due under the agreement.

3. **Relevance to Query**: Your query asks about a cap on liability without carveouts. The presence of these carveouts indicates that the liability cap is not absolute; it does not apply to all potential claims or losses. Instead, it is limited to specific circumstances, meaning that in certain situations, the parties may be liable for amounts exceeding the AUD 50,000 cap. 

In summary, while the clause establishes a cap on liability, the existence of carveouts means that the cap is not comprehensive, and certain obligations can lead to liability beyond the stated limit. This is crucial for understanding the full scope of liability in the agreement.",5

In no event shall CarMax be liable for loss of profits or revenue or for any incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages.","The clause you provided outlines a cap on liability for CarMax in relation to any loss or damage arising from the agreement. This is directly relevant to your query about a ""cap on liability without carveouts"" for several reasons:

1. **Cap on Liability**: The clause explicitly states that CarMax's liability is limited to ""the price allocable to the particular Products or Services upon which such liability is based."" This establishes a clear maximum amount that CarMax can be held liable for, which is a fundamental aspect of a cap on liability.

2. **No Carveouts**: The phrase ""regardless of whether such liability arises in contract, tort (including, without limitation, negligence or strict liability) or otherwise"" indicates that the cap applies universally, without exceptions or carveouts for different types of claims. This means that no matter the legal theory under which a claim is brought, the liability is still capped at the specified amount.

3. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause further states that CarMax shall not be liable for ""loss of profits or revenue or for any incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages."" This reinforces the limitation on liability by excluding certain types of damages that could otherwise lead to higher liability amounts, thus supporting the notion of a cap without exceptions.

Here's a breakdown of how it relates to the query:

1. **Cap on Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the total amount recoverable by one party from the other for any claims arising from the agreement (whether due to negligence, willful misconduct, or other reasons) is capped at the total payments made under the agreement. This means that regardless of the circumstances, the liability is limited to a specific financial amount, which is a key aspect of a cap on liability.

2. **No Carveouts**: The clause does not include any specific exceptions or carveouts that would allow for higher liability in certain situations (other than the exception for personal injury or death due to negligence). This means that the cap applies broadly to all claims related to the performance or nonperformance of obligations under the agreement, reinforcing the idea that the liability is limited without additional exceptions.

3. **Legal Context**: The clause acknowledges that there are certain legal limitations (e.g., personal injury or death caused by negligence) where liability cannot be capped. However, for all other claims, the cap is firmly established, which aligns with the query's focus on a cap on liability without additional carveouts.

In summary, this clause effectively limits the liability of the parties to the amount of payments made under the agreement, without introducing exceptions that would allow for greater liability, thus directly addressing the query about a cap on liability without carveouts.",5

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause states that the maximum liability of one party to the other is capped at a specified amount (denoted as [***]). This means that, under normal circumstances, neither party can claim damages exceeding this amount.

2. **Carveouts**: The clause explicitly lists exceptions to the Liability Cap:

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause you provided outlines the limitations of liability between the parties involved in the agreement, specifically addressing the concept of a ""Liability Cap."" This is directly relevant to your query about ""liability cap carveouts"" because it specifies certain exceptions to the general limitation of liability.

Here's how the clause relates to the concept of liability cap carveouts:

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This is a common feature in contracts to protect parties from excessive financial exposure.

2. **Carveouts from the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly lists exceptions (or carveouts) to the Liability Cap, meaning that in certain situations, the cap does not apply. These carveouts include:
   - **Material Breach of Confidentiality**: If one party breaches the confidentiality obligations outlined in Section 5, the Liability Cap does not limit the liability for that breach. This is significant because confidentiality breaches can lead to substantial harm, and the parties want to ensure that they can seek full remedies in such cases.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: The Liability Cap also does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses or claims, the indemnifying party cannot rely on the Liability Cap to limit their financial responsibility.
   - **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: The clause states that the Liability Cap does not apply in cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This is important because it holds parties accountable for serious wrongdoing, ensuring that they cannot escape liability for egregious actions.

3. **Comprehensive Definition of Liability**: The clause provides a broad definition of ""liability,"" encompassing various types of claims and damages. This comprehensive approach ensures that all potential liabilities are considered, reinforcing the importance of the carveouts.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query about liability cap carveouts because it clearly delineates the circumstances under which the Liability Cap does not apply, thereby ensuring that parties remain accountable for significant breaches and misconduct.",5

Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The clause you provided outlines a limitation of liability, which is a common provision in contracts that seeks to cap the amount one party can recover from the other in the event of a claim. This is particularly relevant to your query about ""liability cap carveouts.""

1. **Limitations of Liability**: The clause specifies that, generally, the liability of either party is capped at the total amount of payments made under the agreement. This means that if one party suffers damages due to the other party's actions (or inactions), their recovery is limited to the amount they have paid under the contract.

2. **Carveouts**: The clause includes a significant carveout for personal injury or death caused by negligence. This means that, regardless of the liability cap, if a party's negligence results in personal injury or death, they can be held fully liable without any cap on damages. This is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, as liability for personal injury or death cannot typically be limited by contract.

3. **Relevance to Liability Cap Carveouts**: The mention of personal injury or death as an exception to the liability cap is a classic example of a carveout. Carveouts are important because they delineate specific circumstances under which the general limitation of liability does not apply. In this case, the clause ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious harm caused by their negligence, thus protecting the rights of individuals who may be affected.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it illustrates how liability caps can be structured in contracts, while also highlighting the importance of carveouts for certain types of liability, such as those arising from personal injury or death.",5

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Cap on Liability**: The clause establishes a ""Liability Cap,"" which is the maximum amount one party can be held liable to the other under the agreement. This is a common practice in contracts to limit potential financial exposure.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply:
   - **Material Breach of Confidentiality**: If there is a significant breach of confidentiality (as defined in Section 5), the cap does not limit liability. This is important because confidentiality breaches can have severe consequences, and parties may want to ensure full accountability in such cases.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: The Liability Cap does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other (e.g., for third-party claims), the cap does not limit the amount they may have to pay.
   - **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: The cap also does not apply in cases of intentional wrongdoing or gross negligence. This is significant because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct.

3. **Definition of Liability**: The clause provides a broad definition of ""liability,"" encompassing various claims and damages, which reinforces the understanding that the cap is comprehensive but also subject to the outlined exceptions.

4. **Subject to Law**: While the clause does not explicitly mention that the Liability Cap is subject to law, the exceptions imply that legal standards and obligations (such as those related to confidentiality breaches, indemnification, and gross negligence) will take precedence over the cap. This aligns with the general legal principle that parties cannot contractually limit liability for certain types of conduct that are deemed unacceptable by law.

In summary, this clause effectively sets a cap on liability while also ensuring that certain serious breaches and misconduct are not shielded by that cap, thereby aligning with legal standards and principles.",5

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a ""Liability Cap,"" which is the maximum amount one party can be held liable to the other under the agreement. This is a common practice in contracts to limit potential financial exposure.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific circumstances under which the Liability Cap does not apply. These exclusions are significant because they indicate that certain types of liability are not subject to the cap, which is important for legal compliance and risk management. The exclusions include:
   - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).
   - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).
   - Intentional misconduct and gross negligence.

3. **Legal Compliance**: The phrase ""subject to law"" implies that the Liability Cap and its exclusions must comply with applicable laws and regulations. This means that even if the contract states a cap, it cannot limit liability in a way that contravenes statutory requirements or public policy. For example, some jurisdictions may not allow caps on liability for certain types of damages, such as those arising from willful misconduct or personal injury.

4. **Broad Definition of Liability**: The clause provides a comprehensive definition of ""liability,"" which includes various forms of claims and damages. This broad definition ensures that all potential liabilities are considered, reinforcing the importance of the Liability Cap and its exclusions.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it establishes a framework for limiting liability while also recognizing that certain legal obligations and types of misconduct are exempt from such limitations.

This is relevant to your query about a ""cap on liability subject to law"" for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the total aggregate liability of one party to another for any claims related to breaches of the agreement is capped at a specific amount. This amount is defined as the total purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for products over the twelve months preceding the claim notification. This establishes a clear financial limit on potential liabilities, which is a common practice in contracts to manage risk.

2. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply. These exceptions include:
   - Breaches related to unauthorized use of Intellectual Property.
   - Intentional breaches or willful misconduct.
   - Non-compliance with mandatory applicable laws or regulations.

   This means that if a party's actions fall into one of these categories, they could be liable for amounts exceeding the cap, which aligns with the notion that certain legal obligations cannot be limited by contract.

3. **Compliance with Law**: The reference to ""non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation"" indicates that the parties cannot contractually limit their liability for violations of laws that are mandatory. This is important because it ensures that the clause complies with legal standards, as parties cannot waive liability for statutory obligations.

4. **Risk Management**: By including a liability cap, the parties are managing their financial exposure in the event of a breach. However, the exceptions ensure that they remain accountable for serious breaches that could have significant legal implications, thus balancing risk management with legal compliance.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a cap on liability while also ensuring that the parties remain compliant with applicable laws, thereby addressing the legal limitations on liability that cannot be waived or capped by contract.",5

failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause you provided, specifically Section 11.4 on Limitation of Liability, is relevant to the query regarding a ""cap on liability subject to law"" in several ways:

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a clear monetary limit (AUD 50,000.00) on the aggregate liability of both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising from any cause related to the Agreement. This is a typical feature in contracts to manage risk and limit exposure to potential claims.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply. These exceptions include:
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds to the Merchant.
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations related to services, network security fees, and regulatory obligations due to non-performance.

3. **Compliance with Law**: The phrase ""subject to law"" implies that the limitation of liability must comply with applicable legal standards. In many jurisdictions, certain types of liability (such as for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or statutory obligations) cannot be limited or capped by contract. Therefore, while the clause sets a cap, it must be interpreted in light of applicable laws that may override or invalidate such limitations.

4. **Risk Management**: By including a cap on liability, the parties are attempting to manage their financial risk in the event of a dispute or loss. However, the exceptions indicate that there are critical obligations that cannot be limited, ensuring that both parties remain accountable for significant responsibilities.

Here's how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party (in this case, D2 and the Licensee) can be held liable for certain types of damages, specifically lost profits or consequential, special, incidental, or indirect damages. This establishes a clear limitation on the types of damages that can be claimed, which is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from extensive liability.

2. **Cap on Liability**: The clause further specifies that D2's liability is capped at the total amount paid or owed by the Licensee to D2 under the agreement. This means that regardless of the circumstances, D2 cannot be liable for more than this specified amount. This is a clear cap on liability, which is a critical aspect of risk management in contractual agreements.

3. **Subject to Law**: While the clause does not explicitly mention that these limitations are subject to law, it is generally understood that any contractual limitation of liability must comply with applicable laws and regulations. Certain jurisdictions may have laws that limit the enforceability of such clauses, especially in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Therefore, while the clause attempts to limit liability, it is implicitly subject to the governing law that may override or modify these limitations.

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a general limit on the amount either party can claim from the other for losses related to the agreement. This is a common practice in contracts to manage risk and exposure.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to certain obligations:
   - **Obligation to remit proceeds**: Fiserv's responsibility to remit transaction proceeds to the Merchant is not limited by the cap. This ensures that the Merchant can recover the full amount of its transaction proceeds, which is crucial for compliance with financial regulations.
   - **Merchant’s payment obligations**: The Merchant's obligations to pay for services, including any amounts due to regulatory authorities due to non-compliance with the agreement, are also exempt from the cap. This means that if the Merchant fails to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, it can be held fully liable for any resulting penalties or fees, regardless of the AUD 50,000 limit.

3. **Compliance with Law Carveout**: The second exception specifically addresses compliance with legal obligations. By stating that the Merchant is fully liable for amounts imposed by regulatory authorities due to its failure to perform its obligations, the clause effectively creates a carveout for compliance with laws.

In other words, if a party's actions or omissions result in a violation of the law, they could be held liable for damages that would otherwise be limited by this clause. 

Therefore, if you are considering adding a compliance with law carveout to this limitation of liability clause, it would clarify that the limitations on liability do not apply in situations where a party has breached legal obligations, ensuring that parties remain accountable for compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

In the context of your query regarding a ""compliance with law carveout to cap on liability,"" the clause is relevant because it indicates that the limitation of liability does not apply in certain circumstances, particularly in cases of personal injury or death due to negligence.

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause sets a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This means that, under normal circumstances, the amount one party can be held liable for is capped at a specified amount.

2. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause includes specific carveouts to this Liability Cap. Notably, it states that the Liability Cap does not apply to:

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel. Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause you provided outlines the indemnification obligations of one party (the ""you"" in the clause) towards another party (the ""us"" or ""Indemnitees""). In the context of your query regarding an ""indemnification carveout to cap on liability,"" this clause is particularly relevant for several reasons:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause establishes a broad indemnification requirement, where the indemnifying party agrees to hold the Indemnitees harmless from a wide range of losses and expenses arising from the operation of the Franchised Business. This includes claims related to negligence, which can lead to significant financial exposure.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: The clause specifies that the indemnity applies to all losses and expenses incurred in connection with various legal proceedings, claims, and investigations. This broad scope can potentially lead to substantial liability for the indemnifying party, especially if there are no caps on the amount they may be required to pay.

3. **Carveout for Gross Negligence**: The clause includes a carveout that limits the indemnification obligation in cases of gross negligence by the Indemnitees. This means that if the Indemnitees are found to be grossly negligent, the indemnifying party is not responsible for indemnifying them for those specific liabilities. This is a critical aspect of the clause, as it provides a limitation on liability in certain circumstances.

4. **Potential for Liability Caps**: While the clause does not explicitly mention a cap on liability, the concept of a cap on liability is often included in contracts to limit the financial exposure of one party. If a cap were to be included in conjunction with this indemnification clause, it would need to be carefully drafted to ensure that it does not conflict with the indemnification obligations. For example, the cap could apply to all liabilities except those arising from indemnification claims, thereby creating a carveout for indemnification obligations.

5. **Legal Fees and Costs**: The clause also specifies that the indemnifying party is responsible for covering legal fees and costs associated with defending against claims. This can significantly increase the financial burden on the indemnifying party, especially if there are no caps on these costs.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the obligations and potential liabilities of the indemnifying party, while also hinting at the need for careful consideration of liability caps and carveouts in the context of indemnification. If a cap on liability were to be introduced, it would need to be structured in a way that aligns with the indemnification obligations set forth in this clause.",4

7 Indemnification and Insurance. 7.1 <omitted>
9 Limitation of Liability.
9.1 The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party and its affiliates in relation to this Agreement will be [***] (""Liability Cap""), provided however that:
9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding an indemnification carveout to a cap on liability because it explicitly outlines exceptions to the general limitation of liability established in the agreement.

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause sets a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This means that, under normal circumstances, the amount one party can be held liable for is capped at a specified amount.

2. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause includes specific carveouts to this Liability Cap. Notably, it states that the Liability Cap does not apply to:
   - **Material confidentiality breaches** (Section 5)
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1)

   This means that if one party breaches confidentiality or fails to meet its indemnification obligations, they can be held liable for amounts exceeding the Liability Cap. This is significant because it ensures that parties are held accountable for serious breaches or failures that could have substantial consequences.

3. **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: Additionally, the clause states that the Liability Cap does not apply to claims arising from intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This further reinforces the idea that certain serious actions or failures are not protected by the cap, allowing for full liability in those cases.

In summary, this clause effectively creates a framework where the parties have a limited liability for most claims, but carveouts exist for serious breaches of confidentiality and indemnification obligations, ensuring that parties cannot escape liability for significant failures or misconduct. This aligns with the query about indemnification carveouts to a cap on liability, as it directly addresses how indemnification obligations are treated in relation to the overall liability limits.",5

1. **Section 12.3 - No Liability for Consequential Damages**: This section establishes that neither party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. However, it explicitly states that this limitation does not apply to obligations of either party to indemnify the other for ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other (for example, due to third-party claims or losses arising from breaches of representations and warranties), the indemnifying party is not protected by the limitation on liability for consequential damages. This creates a carveout for indemnification obligations, allowing for potential liability beyond the cap for those specific situations.

2. **Section 12.4 - Limitation on Liability**: This section sets a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of each party to the other for all causes of action, regardless of whether they arise from contract or tort. It establishes a monetary limit on liability, which is a common practice in contracts to manage risk. However, the important aspect here is that the limitation on liability is stated to apply ""regardless of the form of action"" and ""whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12."" This means that while there is a general cap on liability, the carveout in Section 12.3 allows for indemnification claims to potentially exceed this cap, particularly for consequential damages related to indemnifiable losses.

In summary, the relevance of this clause to your query lies in the interplay between the limitation on liability and the indemnification obligations. The carveout in Section 12.3 ensures that indemnification claims are not subject to the same cap on liability, allowing for greater exposure in cases of indemnifiable losses, which is a critical consideration in risk management for both parties involved in the agreement.",5

1. **No Liability for Consequential Damages (Section 12.3)**: This section establishes that neither party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. However, it explicitly states that this limitation does not apply to obligations related to indemnification for ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses, those indemnification obligations are not subject to the limitation on liability for consequential damages. This creates a carveout for indemnification obligations, allowing for potential liability beyond the cap for direct damages.

2. **Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4)**: This section sets a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of each party to the other for any and all causes of action, regardless of whether they arise from contract or tort. It establishes a monetary limit on the damages that can be claimed, which is typically intended to protect parties from excessive liability. However, the carveout in Section 12.3 means that any indemnification obligations are not limited by this cap, allowing for potentially higher liability in cases where one party must indemnify the other.

In summary, the relevance of this clause to your query lies in the interplay between the limitation on liability and the indemnification obligations. The carveout ensures that indemnification claims can exceed the cap on liability, providing a safeguard for parties against certain types of losses that may arise from indemnifiable events.",5

Here's how it is relevant to your query about the IP infringement exception to the cap on liability:

1. **Exemption from Limitations**: The clause explicitly states that the limitations on liability do not apply to claims arising from Section 9.3, which pertains to intellectual property infringement. This means that if one party infringes on the intellectual property rights of the other, the usual caps on liability (both in terms of types of damages and the maximum amount recoverable) do not apply.

2. **Types of Damages**: The clause specifies that, except for IP infringement claims, neither party can be held liable for indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages. However, in the case of IP infringement, the parties may seek damages that fall outside these limitations, potentially including those types of damages.

3. **Cap on Liability**: The clause also sets a cap on liability for claims not related to IP infringement, limiting it to the amount earned under the revenue-sharing provisions in the preceding twelve months. However, since IP infringement claims are exempt from this cap, a party could potentially be liable for damages that exceed this amount if they infringe on the other party's intellectual property.

In summary, this clause is crucial because it establishes that claims related to intellectual property infringement are treated differently from other types of claims under the agreement, allowing for greater liability and potential damages in such cases. This exception is important for protecting the rights of the parties regarding their intellectual property and ensuring that they can seek appropriate remedies if infringement occurs.",5

It establishes a cap on the total aggregate liability for claims arising from breaches of the agreement, with certain exceptions. 

The relevance of this clause to your query about the ""IP infringement exception to cap on liability"" lies in the specific exception mentioned in subsection (i):

1. **IP Infringement Exception**: The clause explicitly states that the liability cap does not apply to any claims related to ""any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property."" This means that if one party infringes on the intellectual property rights of the other party, the liability for such infringement is not limited by the cap set forth in the clause. 

2. **Implications**: This exception is significant because it allows the injured party to seek full damages for any unauthorized use of their intellectual property, without being constrained by the financial limits that would otherwise apply to other types of claims. This is particularly important in IP-related disputes, where the damages can be substantial and may not be adequately addressed by a cap based on prior purchase prices.

3. **Overall Context**: The clause also includes other exceptions to the liability cap, such as intentional breaches or non-compliance with mandatory laws, but the inclusion of IP infringement as a specific exception highlights the importance of protecting intellectual property rights in the context of the agreement.

Here's how it relates to your query about the IP infringement exception to the cap on liability:

1. **Exclusion from Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that certain types of liability are excluded from the general cap on liability. Specifically, it mentions that liability relating to ""any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property"" is not subject to the liability cap. This means that if one party infringes on the other party's intellectual property rights, the liability for such infringement is not limited to the cap defined in Section 11.3.

2. **Protection Against IP Infringement**: By carving out an exception for unauthorized use of intellectual property, the clause ensures that parties can seek full remedies for IP infringement claims without being restricted by the financial limits that apply to other types of claims. This is particularly important in IP matters, where damages can be significant and may not be adequately addressed by a cap based on prior purchase amounts.

3. **Consistency with Indemnity Provisions**: The clause also references indemnities in Section 10, which likely includes obligations to indemnify the other party for losses arising from IP infringement. This reinforces the idea that IP-related claims are treated with a higher level of seriousness and are not subject to the same limitations as other types of claims.

4. **Overall Risk Management**: The inclusion of this exception reflects a common practice in contracts to ensure that parties are held accountable for serious breaches, such as those involving intellectual property, which can have far-reaching consequences for the affected party.

The relevance of this clause to your query about a ""third party IP infringement exception to cap on liability"" can be broken down as follows:

1. **Exclusion of IP Infringement from Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that liability arising from Section 9.3, which pertains to Intellectual Property (IP) infringement, is an exception to the general limitations on liability. This means that if one party infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party, this infringement is not subject to the liability cap outlined in the clause. 

2. **Implications for Third Party Claims**: If a third party claims that one of the parties has infringed on its intellectual property rights, the party responsible for the infringement may be liable for damages resulting from that infringement. This liability is not limited by the cap that applies to other types of claims (indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages) or the revenue-sharing limit mentioned in the clause.

3. **Protection Against Indirect Damages**: While the clause limits liability for indirect damages and caps liability based on revenue earned, the exception for IP infringement suggests that the parties recognize the potential severity and direct consequences of IP infringement claims. This is particularly important in industries where intellectual property is a core asset, and the risk of significant damages from third-party claims is high.

4. **Encouragement of Compliance**: By excluding IP infringement from the liability cap, the clause encourages both parties to be diligent in their use of intellectual property and to avoid infringing on third-party rights. This can lead to more careful management of IP assets and a greater emphasis on compliance with IP laws.

Here's how it is relevant to your query about the third-party IP infringement exception to the cap on liability:

1. **General Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a general rule that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. This is a common provision in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable damages that could arise from various claims.

2. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly carves out an exception for claims or liabilities that arise from the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if one party's actions lead to a claim that a third party's IP rights have been infringed, the limitation on liability does not apply. In other words, the party responsible for the infringement could be held liable for damages without the cap that would normally limit their liability.

3. **Importance of IP Rights**: Intellectual property rights are often critical assets for businesses, and infringement can lead to significant legal and financial consequences. By including this exception, the parties acknowledge the seriousness of IP infringement claims and agree that such claims should not be subject to the same limitations as other types of claims.

4. **Risk Allocation**: This clause effectively allocates the risk associated with third-party IP infringement. It ensures that if a party's actions infringe on another's IP rights, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for the resulting damages.

1. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the liability cap does not apply to claims related to:
   - Unauthorized use of Intellectual Property (IP).
   - Intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party.
   - Non-compliance with mandatory applicable laws or regulations.

2. **Third-Party IP Infringement**: The mention of ""unauthorized use of Intellectual Property"" suggests that if a party is found to have infringed upon a third party's IP rights (for example, by using patented technology without permission), this would fall under the exception. In such cases, the party responsible for the infringement could be liable for damages that exceed the liability cap, as the cap does not apply to claims related to unauthorized IP use.

3. **Implications**: This means that if a third party were to bring a claim against one of the parties to the agreement for IP infringement, the party accused of infringement would not be able to limit their liability to the capped amount specified in the clause. Instead, they could be held liable for the full extent of damages resulting from the infringement, which could include substantial financial penalties, legal fees, and other costs.

2. **Increased Liability for IP Infringement**: By carving out this exception, the clause indicates that the parties recognize the seriousness of IP infringement claims. In such cases, the liable party may face full liability, including potential damages that could be considered special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental, which would otherwise be limited under the agreement.

3. **Protection for Third Parties**: This exception serves to protect third parties whose intellectual property rights may be infringed upon by the actions of one of the parties to the agreement. It ensures that the party responsible for the infringement cannot escape liability simply because of the limitation clause.

4. **Survival of Clause**: The clause also states that this limitation of liability section will survive the termination or expiration of the agreement. This means that even after the agreement ends, the parties remain liable for any claims related to third-party IP infringement that may arise.

In summary, this clause is crucial because it delineates the boundaries of liability between the parties while ensuring that third-party IP rights are respected and that parties cannot evade responsibility for infringement claims.",5

Here's how it relates to your query about a third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement exception to the cap on liability:

1. **Indemnity for Unauthorized Use of Intellectual Property**: The clause explicitly states that there are exceptions to the limitations on liability, particularly concerning breaches associated with the unauthorized use of intellectual property. This means that if one party infringes on a third party's intellectual property rights, they cannot rely on the liability cap to limit their responsibility for damages arising from that infringement.

2. **Liability Cap Exceptions**: Section 11.3 of the clause outlines specific exceptions to the liability cap, which includes any liability related to breaches associated with unauthorized use of intellectual property. This indicates that if a party is found liable for infringing on a third party's IP rights, they would be fully responsible for any damages incurred, regardless of the cap on liability that would otherwise apply.

3. **Protection Against Third-Party Claims**: By including this exception, the clause ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious breaches that could harm third parties, such as IP infringement. This is particularly important in commercial agreements where intellectual property is often a critical asset.

4. **Overall Impact**: The inclusion of these exceptions serves to protect both parties from the risks associated with IP infringement claims, ensuring that they remain accountable for their actions and that third-party rights are respected. It also encourages parties to be diligent in their use of intellectual property to avoid potential liabilities.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it clearly delineates the circumstances under which the liability cap does not apply, specifically in cases of unauthorized use of intellectual property, thereby addressing third-party IP infringement concerns.",5

It is relevant to your query regarding liability cap clauses that exclude third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement and certain types of misconduct, such as fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, for the following reasons:

1. **Exclusion of IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that liability arising from Section 9.3, which pertains to intellectual property infringement, is not subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.4. This means that if one party infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party, they cannot rely on the liability cap to limit their responsibility for damages resulting from that infringement. This aligns with your query about excluding third-party IP infringement from liability caps.

2. **Limitation on Types of Damages**: The clause limits liability for indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages. This is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from extensive financial exposure. However, it does not address the exclusions you mentioned (fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct). If the parties wanted to exclude these types of misconduct from the liability cap, they would need to explicitly state that in the clause.

3. **Cap on Liability**: The clause also sets a cap on liability, stating that neither party shall be liable for an amount greater than what they have earned under the revenue-sharing provisions in the preceding twelve months. This cap does not apply to the liability arising from IP infringement, but it also does not mention exclusions for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. If the parties intend to exclude these types of liability from the cap, it would need to be clearly articulated in the contract.

In summary, while the clause effectively addresses the exclusion of liability for third-party IP infringement, it does not explicitly exclude liability for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. To fully align with your query, the clause would need to be amended to include these exclusions.",4
"liability cap clauses that exclude third party IP infringement and fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct",a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding liability cap clauses that exclude third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement and certain types of misconduct, such as fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

### Breakdown of the Clause:

1. **Exclusion of Third-Party IP Infringement**: 
   - The clause explicitly states that it does not apply to claims or liabilities arising from the infringement of any third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if one party's actions lead to a claim that a third party's IP rights have been violated, the liability cap does not limit the responsible party's liability for that infringement. This is crucial because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for infringing on others' IP rights, which is a significant concern in many contracts.

2. **Limitation of Liability**:
   - The clause further states that, aside from the specified exclusions (like third-party IP infringement), neither party shall be liable for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. This is a common feature in liability cap clauses, as it seeks to limit the potential financial exposure of the parties involved in the contract. 

3. **Exclusion of Other Misconduct**:
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, it is common for liability cap clauses to include similar exclusions. In many contracts, parties will specify that liability caps do not apply in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct to ensure that parties cannot limit their liability for serious wrongdoing.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause aligns with the query by demonstrating how liability caps can be structured to exclude certain critical areas of liability, such as third-party IP infringement. It highlights the importance of ensuring that parties remain accountable for significant legal and ethical responsibilities, even when liability caps are in place. 

- If you are drafting or reviewing a contract, it would be prudent to ensure that similar exclusions are included for fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct to protect against serious breaches of duty or misconduct that could cause significant harm. 

In summary, the clause serves as a foundational example of how liability caps can be tailored to exclude certain types of claims, ensuring that parties remain liable for significant legal issues while limiting exposure to less severe claims.",4

1. **Exclusion of Liability for IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that the liability cap does not apply to any liability relating to breaches associated with the unauthorized use of intellectual property. This means that if one party infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party, they cannot limit their liability under the cap for such claims. This aligns with your query's requirement to exclude third-party IP infringement from the liability cap.

2. **Exclusion of Willful Misconduct**: The clause also specifies that liability arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party is excluded from the liability cap. This means that if a party engages in fraudulent behavior or gross negligence, they cannot rely on the liability cap to limit their exposure to damages. This addresses your query's concern regarding the exclusion of fraud and willful misconduct from the liability limitations.

3. **General Structure of Liability Cap**: The clause outlines a general liability cap that limits the total aggregate liability of one party to another for claims related to breaches of the agreement. However, it clearly delineates exceptions to this cap, ensuring that certain serious breaches (like those involving IP infringement, willful misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws) are not subject to the limitations imposed by the cap.

In summary, the clause effectively addresses your query by providing specific exclusions from the liability cap for third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct, ensuring that parties cannot limit their liability for these serious issues.",5

1. **Exclusion of Third-Party IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that liability is not capped for breaches associated with the unauthorized use of intellectual property. This means that if one party infringes on a third party's intellectual property rights, they cannot limit their liability for such infringement, which aligns with your query regarding the exclusion of third-party IP infringement from liability caps.

2. **Exclusion of Willful Misconduct**: The clause also specifies that liability is not limited in cases arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party. This directly addresses your concern about excluding willful misconduct from liability caps, ensuring that parties cannot escape liability for serious breaches of conduct.

3. **General Liability Cap**: The clause outlines a general liability cap that limits the total aggregate liability of one party to another for claims related to breaches of the agreement. However, this cap does not apply to the specified exclusions (unauthorized use of IP, intentional breach, or willful misconduct), which is a critical aspect of your query.

4. **Exclusion of Fraud and Gross Negligence**: While the clause does not explicitly mention fraud or gross negligence, it does state that liability is not capped for intentional breaches or willful misconduct. In many legal contexts, fraud and gross negligence can be considered forms of willful misconduct. Therefore, the intent behind the clause may implicitly cover these areas as well, depending on the jurisdiction and specific legal interpretations.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it clearly delineates the boundaries of liability caps, specifically excluding third-party IP infringement and willful misconduct, while also potentially encompassing fraud and gross negligence through its broader definitions of liability exclusions.",5

ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.5 Limitation of Liability, is relevant to your query regarding liability cap clauses that exclude third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement and fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct for several reasons:

1. **Exclusions for Fraud and Breach of IP Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that it does not limit liability in the event of fraud by a party or a breach of obligations under Article 7 (Intellectual Property). This means that if a party commits fraud or violates its IP obligations, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to cap their damages. This directly addresses your concern about excluding liability for third-party IP infringement.

2. **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**: The clause also states that it does not limit liability to the extent that damages are required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification under this article. This means that if a party is required to indemnify another party for claims related to third-party IP infringement, the limitation of liability does not apply. This is crucial for protecting against potential third-party claims.

3. **General Exclusions for Gross Negligence and Willful Misconduct**: While the clause does not explicitly mention gross negligence or willful misconduct, the general legal principle is that liability caps often do not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Therefore, it can be inferred that if such conduct occurs, the limitation of liability would not protect the offending party.

4. **Scope of Damages**: The clause limits liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, remote, exemplary, or speculative damages. However, it clarifies that this limitation does not apply in the specified exceptions (fraud, breach of IP obligations, and indemnification for third-party claims). This reinforces the idea that certain serious breaches or misconduct are not subject to the liability cap.

In summary, this clause effectively addresses your query by outlining specific exclusions from the liability cap for fraud, breaches of IP obligations, and indemnification for third-party claims, while also implicitly acknowledging that gross negligence and willful misconduct would typically fall outside the scope of liability limitations.",5

Specifically, it establishes a ""Liability Cap,"" which is the maximum amount one party can be held liable to the other under the terms of the agreement. However, there are exceptions to this cap, which are relevant to your query regarding personal or bodily injury.

1. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: 
   - The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to certain situations, including:
     - **Material confidentiality breaches** (Section 5)
     - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1)
     - **Intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2)

2. **Relevance to Personal or Bodily Injury**: 
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury, it is important to note that claims related to personal or bodily injury typically arise from negligence or intentional misconduct. 
   - The exception for ""intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence"" suggests that if a party's actions lead to personal or bodily injury, they may be held liable beyond the Liability Cap. This is significant because personal injury claims often involve serious consequences and may not be adequately addressed by a predetermined cap on liability.

3. **Interpretation**: 
   - In legal terms, if a party's actions result in personal or bodily injury, and those actions are deemed to be grossly negligent or intentional, the injured party could pursue claims that exceed the Liability Cap. This means that the party responsible for the injury could face greater financial liability than what is typically limited by the agreement.

In summary, while the clause does not directly mention personal or bodily injury, the exceptions outlined indicate that such claims could fall outside the Liability Cap, particularly if they involve gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

     - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).
     - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).
     - Intentional misconduct and gross negligence.

2. **Personal or Bodily Injury**: 
   - While the clause does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury, it is generally understood in legal contexts that liability for personal injury or bodily harm typically falls outside the scope of liability caps. This is because such injuries often involve serious consequences and public policy considerations that warrant full accountability rather than limiting liability.

3. **Interpretation**: 
   - In practice, if a party were to suffer personal or bodily injury as a result of the other party's actions, the injured party could argue that the Liability Cap does not apply to their claim. This is consistent with the general legal principle that parties cannot contractually limit liability for personal injury or bodily harm.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury, the exceptions to the Liability Cap, along with general legal principles, suggest that claims related to personal or bodily injury would likely not be subject to the limitations set forth in this clause. This means that a party could pursue full damages for such claims without being constrained by the Liability Cap.",4

Specifically, it establishes a cap on the amount one party can recover from the other for claims arising from the performance or nonperformance of obligations under the agreement. However, it includes a critical exception for personal injury or death caused by negligence.

Here's how this clause is relevant to your query about the personal or bodily injury exception to the liability cap:

1. **General Limitation of Liability**: The clause sets a general rule that limits the liability of each party to the other to the amount of payments made under the agreement. This means that for most claims, the parties cannot seek damages beyond this specified amount.

2. **Exception for Personal Injury or Death**: The clause explicitly states that this limitation does not apply in cases of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party. This means that if one party's negligence results in personal injury or death, the injured party can pursue claims for damages without being restricted by the liability cap.

3. **Legal Compliance**: The clause acknowledges that, by law, there are certain types of claims (like those involving personal injury or death) for which liability cannot be limited. This is important because it ensures that the agreement complies with legal standards that protect individuals from being unfairly limited in their ability to seek compensation for serious harm.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the boundaries of liability between the parties while also ensuring that serious claims related to personal injury or death are exempt from the limitations imposed by the agreement.

It states that neither party will be liable for certain types of damages—namely, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages—related to the agreement. 

In the context of your query regarding a ""personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap,"" this clause is relevant because it may imply that the limitation of liability does not cover personal or bodily injury claims. Typically, liability caps and limitations are designed to protect parties from extensive financial exposure, but many jurisdictions and legal frameworks recognize that personal or bodily injury claims are often treated differently. 

Here’s how the clause relates to your query:

1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause explicitly excludes liability for indirect and consequential damages, which often do not include personal injury claims. Personal injury claims typically arise from direct harm to an individual and may not fall under the categories of damages listed in the clause.

2. **Legal Precedent**: In many legal contexts, liability limitations do not apply to personal injury or bodily injury claims. Courts often hold that parties cannot contractually limit their liability for harm that results from negligence or willful misconduct that causes personal injury.

3. **Interpretation of Liability Caps**: If the agreement intends to limit liability, it may be necessary to explicitly state that personal or bodily injury claims are exceptions to the liability cap. The absence of such language in the clause could suggest that the parties did not intend to limit liability for these types of claims.

In summary, while the clause limits liability for certain types of damages, it may not apply to personal or bodily injury claims, which could be an important consideration in interpreting the agreement and assessing liability. If the parties wish to clarify this point, they may need to include specific language that addresses personal or bodily injury exceptions to the liability cap.",4

This limitation is a common feature in contracts to protect parties from extensive financial liability.

In relation to your query about a ""personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap,"" the clause does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury. However, it is important to note that many liability limitation clauses include exceptions for certain types of damages, particularly those related to personal injury or bodily injury. 

In this case, the clause states that the limitation on liability applies ""EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH OF SECTION 11,"" which pertains to confidential information. This suggests that there may be other exceptions not explicitly listed in the clause. If personal or bodily injury is not mentioned as an exception, it may still be subject to general legal principles that do not allow parties to limit liability for such injuries, as they are often considered non-waivable rights.

In summary, while the clause limits liability for certain types of damages, it does not address personal or bodily injury directly. Depending on the jurisdiction and applicable law, personal or bodily injury claims may not be subject to the same limitations and could be exempt from the liability cap outlined in the clause.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply in certain circumstances, which are critical to understanding the confidentiality exceptions:
   - **Material Confidentiality Breach**: Section 9.1.1(1) specifies that the Liability Cap does not apply to any material breach of confidentiality as outlined in Section 5. This means that if one party breaches the confidentiality obligations, they can be held liable beyond the established cap, emphasizing the importance of maintaining confidentiality.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: Section 9.1.1(2) indicates that the Liability Cap also does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses or damages, the indemnifying party's liability is not limited by the cap.

3. **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: Additionally, Section 9.1.2 states that the Liability Cap does not apply to cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This further protects parties from being limited in their ability to seek damages in serious situations.

Here’s how it relates to your query about confidentiality exceptions to the liability cap:

1. **Liability Cap Definition**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This cap is intended to protect parties from excessive financial exposure resulting from claims related to the agreement.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply in certain circumstances, which are critical to understanding the exceptions:
   - **Material Confidentiality Breach**: Section 9.1.1(1) specifies that the Liability Cap does not apply to any material breach of confidentiality as outlined in Section 5. This means that if one party breaches the confidentiality obligations, they can be held liable beyond the established cap, emphasizing the importance of maintaining confidentiality in the agreement.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: Section 9.1.1(2) indicates that the Liability Cap also does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses or damages, they can be held liable beyond the cap.

3. **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: Additionally, Section 9.1.2 states that the Liability Cap does not apply to cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This further protects parties from being limited in their recovery in serious situations where one party acts with intent to harm or demonstrates a severe lack of care.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it clearly outlines the exceptions to the liability cap, particularly in relation to breaches of confidentiality, indemnification obligations, and serious misconduct. This ensures that parties are held accountable for significant breaches or wrongful actions, thereby reinforcing the importance of confidentiality and responsible conduct in the agreement.",5

Here’s how it relates to your query about confidentiality exceptions to the liability cap:

1. **Indemnities and Liability Limitations**: The clause begins by stating that, notwithstanding the limitations on liability, certain obligations remain unaffected. This includes the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. This means that any breaches of confidentiality are not subject to the liability cap outlined in Section 11.3.

2. **Exceptions to Liability Cap**: Section 11.3 explicitly lists exceptions to the liability cap, which include:
   - Breaches associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property.
   - Intentional breaches or willful misconduct.
   - Non-compliance with mandatory applicable laws or regulations.

   While the clause does not explicitly mention breaches of confidentiality as an exception, it does state that the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement are not affected by the liability cap. This implies that any claims arising from breaches of confidentiality would not be limited by the liability cap, allowing for potential recovery beyond the capped amount.

3. **Implications for Confidentiality**: Since the confidentiality obligations are preserved and not subject to the liability cap, if one party breaches the confidentiality agreement, the other party may pursue claims for damages without being restricted by the limitations set forth in Section 11.3. This is significant because it ensures that parties can seek full remedies for breaches of confidentiality, which are often critical in business relationships.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes that while there are general limitations on liability, breaches of confidentiality (and the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement) are treated separately and can lead to claims that exceed the liability cap. This distinction is crucial for parties to understand their rights and potential remedies in the event of a confidentiality breach.",5

Here’s how it relates to your query about confidentiality exceptions to the liability cap:

1. **Confidentiality Agreement Reference**: The clause explicitly states that the obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement are not affected by the liability cap. This means that any breaches of confidentiality are not subject to the limitations on liability that are otherwise established in the agreement. In other words, if a party breaches the confidentiality obligations, they can be held liable beyond the cap specified in Section 11.3.

2. **Exceptions to Liability Cap**: The clause lists specific exceptions to the liability cap, including breaches associated with unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional breaches, willful misconduct, and non-compliance with mandatory laws. The reference to the Confidentiality Agreement implies that breaches of confidentiality are treated similarly to these exceptions, allowing for full liability without the cap in cases of confidentiality breaches.

3. **Implications for Damages**: Since breaches of confidentiality are not limited by the liability cap, a party could potentially face significant damages if they violate confidentiality obligations. This is particularly important in contexts where sensitive information is involved, as it ensures that parties are incentivized to adhere strictly to confidentiality terms.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it clarifies that breaches of confidentiality are exempt from the liability cap, allowing for full accountability and potential damages in such cases. This emphasizes the importance of confidentiality in the agreement and the serious consequences of failing to uphold those obligations.",5

Here's how it relates to your query about confidentiality exceptions to the liability cap:

1. **Confidentiality Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that violations of either party's confidentiality obligations are exceptions to the general limitations of liability. This means that if one party breaches its duty to maintain confidentiality, it can be held liable for damages that exceed the usual cap on liability (which is typically limited to the fees paid or payable under the agreement).

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: Similarly, the clause also notes that indemnification obligations are exceptions to the liability cap. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other (for example, due to third-party claims arising from breaches of the agreement), the liability cap does not apply.

3. **Implications of the Exceptions**: By including these exceptions, the clause ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious breaches of confidentiality or indemnification responsibilities simply by relying on the limitations of liability. This is particularly important in contracts where the protection of sensitive information is critical, as it provides a legal recourse for the non-breaching party to seek damages that may exceed the agreed-upon limits.

4. **Overall Impact**: The inclusion of these exceptions serves to reinforce the importance of confidentiality in the contractual relationship and provides a safeguard for parties against potential losses that could arise from breaches of confidentiality, which could be significant and not easily quantifiable.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it clearly delineates that breaches of confidentiality are not subject to the usual liability caps, thereby allowing for greater accountability and protection for the parties involved in the agreement.",5

3. **Negligence**: While the clause mentions gross negligence, it does not explicitly mention ordinary negligence.

1. **No Consequential Damages (Clause 11.6)**: This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, such as lost profits or indirect damages, arising from the agreement. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for certain situations, including:
   - Breach of confidentiality (Article 10).
   - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.
   - Indemnification obligations (Article 12).

   The inclusion of ""fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct"" as an exception means that if either party engages in these actions, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages resulting from such conduct. This is a common legal principle, as parties are typically held to a higher standard of accountability when their actions involve intentional wrongdoing or extreme negligence.

2. **Liability Limit (Clause 11.7)**: This section sets a cap on the aggregate liability of each party under the agreement. Similar to Clause 11.6, it specifies that this limitation does not apply in cases of:
   - Breach of confidentiality.
   - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.
   - Indemnification obligations.

   This means that if a party commits fraud, is grossly negligent, or engages in willful misconduct, they cannot limit their liability to the agreed-upon cap. This reinforces the idea that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct by relying on contractual limitations.

   This means that if either party engages in any of these actions, they can be held liable for damages beyond the agreed-upon cap, which is a significant carveout from the general limitation of liability.

This means that if a party engages in any of these actions, they cannot rely on the liability cap to limit their financial responsibility. This is significant because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct by invoking a cap on damages.

2. **No Consequential Damages**: The clause also includes a provision that limits liability for consequential damages, but again, it carves out exceptions for fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct. This reinforces the idea that parties are still accountable for serious breaches of conduct, even if they are not liable for other types of damages.

1. **Exclusions from Limitation**: The clause explicitly states exceptions to the limitation of liability. It notes that a party's liability is not limited in cases of:
   - **Fraud**: If a party commits fraud, they cannot limit their liability for the damages resulting from that fraud.
   - **Breach of Specific Obligations**: If a party breaches its obligations under Article 7 (Intellectual Property) or Article 10 (Confidentiality), they are also not subject to the limitation of liability.
   - **Indemnification Claims**: If damages are required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification, the limitation does not apply.

2. **Scope of Liability**: The clause further clarifies that neither party nor their affiliates or sublicensees will be liable for various types of damages (indirect, incidental, consequential, etc.) unless they fall under the exceptions mentioned. This means that for most claims, including those related to negligence or tort, liability is capped and limited to direct damages that are probable and reasonably foreseeable.

3. **Legal Protection**: By including this limitation, the parties are attempting to protect themselves from extensive liability that could arise from unforeseen circumstances, while still holding them accountable for serious breaches like fraud or specific contractual obligations.

4. **Risk Management**: This clause serves as a risk management tool, allowing parties to understand the extent of their potential liabilities and to negotiate terms that reflect their risk tolerance.

In summary, this clause outlines the limitations on liability for various claims, including fraud and negligence, while also specifying the circumstances under which those limitations do not apply. This directly addresses your query about how a party's liability is managed and capped in the context of fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort.",5

EXCEPT UNDER SECTIONS 13(a) AND 13(b), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. EXCEPT UNDER SECTIONS 13(a) AND 13(b), THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR DAMAGES OR ALLEGED DAMAGES HEREUNDER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO, AND WILL NOT EXCEED, THE AMOUNTS TO BE PAID BY CLIENT TO EXCITE HEREUNDER.","The clause you've provided, titled ""LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,"" is directly relevant to the query regarding a party's liability for fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort, particularly in the context of capping that liability.

Here's how the clause addresses the query:

1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause states that neither party will be liable for ""special, incidental or consequential damages."" This means that if one party suffers losses that are not direct or immediate (such as lost profits or business opportunities), they cannot claim those damages from the other party. This is particularly relevant in cases of negligence or tort, where such damages might typically be sought.

2. **Limitation on Liability**: The clause explicitly limits the liability of either party to the amounts that the client is obligated to pay to the other party under the contract. This means that regardless of the nature of the claim (whether it arises from breach of contract, tort, or any other legal theory), the maximum amount that can be claimed as damages is capped at the specified payment amounts. This cap is crucial in managing risk and exposure for both parties.

3. **Exceptions**: The clause mentions exceptions under Sections 13(a) and 13(b), which are not detailed in the provided text. However, it implies that there may be specific circumstances (potentially involving fraud or other serious misconduct) where the limitation does not apply. This is important because it indicates that while liability is generally capped, there are scenarios where a party could still be held fully liable.

4. **Broad Coverage**: The clause covers various legal theories, including tort and negligence, which are central to the query. By stating that liability is limited regardless of the legal basis for the claim, it provides a comprehensive shield against extensive liability.

In summary, this clause effectively caps the liability of the parties involved in the contract for various claims, including those arising from fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort, thereby providing a clear framework for risk management in the contractual relationship.",5

9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9 on Limitation of Liability, is highly relevant to your query regarding a party's liability for fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort subject to a cap. Here’s how it addresses those concerns:

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This means that regardless of the nature of the claim (including fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort), the financial exposure of the liable party is capped at a specified amount. This is a common practice in contracts to manage risk.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply:
   - **Material Breach of Confidentiality**: If a party breaches confidentiality obligations, they are not protected by the Liability Cap, meaning they could be liable for damages beyond the cap.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: Any obligations to indemnify (compensate for harm or loss) under Section 7.1 are also excluded from the cap, ensuring that a party can be held fully liable for indemnification claims.
   - **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: The Liability Cap does not apply in cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This means that if a party acts with intent to deceive or shows a severe lack of care, they can be held liable for damages beyond the cap.

3. **Definition of Liability**: The clause provides a broad definition of ""liability,"" encompassing various claims, including those arising from tort (which includes negligence), contract, and other legal theories. This ensures that the cap applies to a wide range of potential claims, but also clarifies that certain serious breaches or wrongful acts are not limited by the cap.

In summary, this clause effectively limits a party's liability for various claims, including fraud and negligence, to a specified amount while also outlining important exceptions that ensure accountability for serious breaches or misconduct. This balance is crucial in contractual agreements to protect both parties while managing risk.",5

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable to the other for certain types of damages, including special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages. This limitation is crucial in defining the extent of liability for various claims, including those arising from fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort.

2. **Exclusions**: The clause outlines exceptions to the limitation of liability, specifically mentioning breaches of confidentiality (Section 11) and indemnification obligations. This means that if a party breaches confidentiality or has indemnification obligations, they may still be liable for damages that would otherwise be limited.

3. **Applicability to Claims**: The clause indicates that the limitation applies regardless of the form of action (contract, tort, product liability, etc.), which encompasses claims for negligence and torts. However, it also notes that this limitation does not apply if it is contrary to applicable law, suggesting that certain legal standards may override the limitations set forth in the clause.

4. **Third Party Claims**: The clause also mentions that if special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages have been awarded to a third party under a third-party claim, the limitation may not apply. This means that if a party is held liable to a third party, the limitations on liability may not protect them in that context.

In summary, this clause serves to cap the liability of the parties involved in the contract concerning various claims, including fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort, while also outlining specific exceptions and conditions under which the limitations may not apply. It is essential for parties to understand these limitations when entering into a contract to assess their potential exposure to liability.",4

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply:
   - **Material Breach of Confidentiality**: If there is a significant breach of confidentiality as defined in Section 5, the cap does not limit liability.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: Any obligations to indemnify under Section 7.1 are also excluded from the cap.
   - **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: The cap does not apply in cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, which are serious forms of wrongdoing that could lead to significant damages.

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a ""Liability Cap,"" which is a limit on the maximum amount one party can be held liable to the other under the agreement. This is a common feature in contracts to manage risk and exposure.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly outlines exceptions to the Liability Cap in Section 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. These exceptions are critical because they indicate circumstances under which the cap does not apply, allowing for greater liability in specific situations.

   - **Section 9.1.1** states that the Liability Cap does not apply to (1) material confidentiality breaches and (2) indemnification obligations. This means that if one party has indemnification obligations (as outlined in Section 7.1), those obligations are not limited by the Liability Cap. This is significant because indemnification often relates to claims for damages, including personal or bodily injury, which could arise from the actions or negligence of one party.

   - **Section 9.1.2** further states that the Liability Cap does not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence. This is particularly relevant in the context of personal or bodily injury, as claims arising from gross negligence or intentional acts may lead to significant damages that exceed the Liability Cap.

3. **Definition of Liability**: The clause defines ""liability"" broadly to include any claims, causes of action, judgments, costs, and expenses, which encompasses personal injury claims. This broad definition ensures that various types of claims, including those related to bodily injury, are covered under the indemnification obligations and the exceptions to the Liability Cap.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query because it outlines how the Liability Cap is structured and specifies exceptions that allow for liability related to personal or bodily injury claims to exceed the cap, particularly through indemnification obligations. This ensures that parties are held accountable for serious breaches or negligent actions that could result in harm to individuals.",5

1. **No Liability for Consequential Damages (Clause 12.3)**: This section states that neither party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. However, it explicitly carves out an exception for obligations related to indemnification in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses, the limitation on liability for consequential damages does not apply. This is significant because it allows for broader liability in cases where indemnification is involved, potentially including personal or bodily injury claims, depending on how ""Indemnifiable Loss"" is defined in the agreement.

2. **Limitation on Liability (Clause 12.4)**: This section establishes a cap on each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for all causes of action, regardless of whether they arise from contract or tort (including negligence). However, it does not specify any exceptions for personal or bodily injury claims. The limitation applies to all claims, including those arising from indemnification provisions. Therefore, if the indemnification provisions do not specifically exclude personal or bodily injury claims from the cap on liability, those claims may still be subject to the overall liability limit.

In summary, the relevance of these clauses to your query lies in the interplay between the limitation on liability and the indemnification carveout. While the indemnification carveout in Clause 12.3 allows for broader liability in certain circumstances, Clause 12.4 imposes a cap on liability that may still apply to personal or bodily injury claims unless explicitly excluded. To fully understand the implications, one would need to review the definitions and scope of ""Indemnifiable Loss"" and any other relevant provisions in the agreement.",4

This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses (which could include personal or bodily injury), the limitation on liability for consequential damages does not apply. Therefore, if a personal or bodily injury claim arises, the indemnification obligations would take precedence, allowing for recovery beyond the cap on liability.

2. **Limitation on Liability (Clause 12.4)**: This section sets a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of each party to the other for all causes of action, regardless of whether they arise from contract or tort, including negligence.

If a personal or bodily injury claim is tied to an indemnification obligation, this clause suggests that the cap on liability may not apply to those specific claims, allowing for potential recovery beyond the stated limit.

In summary, the clauses indicate that while there is a general cap on liability and a limitation on consequential damages, any obligations to indemnify the other party—especially in cases of personal or bodily injury—are carved out from these limitations. This means that claims related to personal or bodily injury could potentially exceed the liability cap and would not be subject to the same limitations as other types of damages.",5

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This is a common feature in contracts to protect parties from excessive financial exposure.

2. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause specifically states that the Liability Cap does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other (for example, for claims arising from personal or bodily injury), the indemnifying party is not limited by the Liability Cap. This is significant because it allows for full recovery of damages related to indemnification claims, which may include personal or bodily injury claims.

3. **Material Breach and Intentional Misconduct**: The clause also notes that the Liability Cap does not apply to material breaches of confidentiality or to claims arising from intentional misconduct or gross negligence. While this does not directly address personal or bodily injury, it reinforces the idea that certain serious claims are exempt from the cap, which could include claims related to personal injury if they arise from gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

4. **Definition of Liability**: The definition of ""liability"" in the clause encompasses a broad range of claims, including those arising from tort (which includes personal injury claims). This broad definition ensures that various types of claims, including those related to personal or bodily injury, are considered under the indemnification obligations and are not subject to the Liability Cap.

In summary, this clause effectively carves out exceptions to the Liability Cap for indemnification obligations, which can include personal or bodily injury claims, thereby allowing for full recovery in such cases.

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel. Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation.

Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause you provided outlines the indemnification obligations of one party (presumably the franchisee) to another party (presumably the franchisor and its affiliates) in the context of claims arising from the operation of the franchised business. Here’s how it relates to your query regarding a personal or bodily injury exception to a cap on liability via an indemnification carveout:

1. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause specifies that the indemnifying party (the franchisee) must indemnify the indemnitees (the franchisor and its affiliates) for ""any and all losses and expenses"" incurred in connection with claims arising from the operation of the franchised business. This includes claims related to the maintenance and operation of vehicles, which could encompass personal or bodily injury claims.

2. **Exclusion of Gross Negligence**: The clause includes a significant exception: indemnification does not apply to liabilities arising from the gross negligence of the indemnitees. This means that if the franchisor or its affiliates are found to be grossly negligent, they cannot seek indemnification from the franchisee for those specific claims. This is a critical carveout that protects the indemnitees from liability arising from their own severe misconduct.

3. **Comprehensive Definition of Losses and Expenses**: The clause defines ""losses and expenses"" broadly, including compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages, which could arise from personal or bodily injury claims. This broad definition ensures that the indemnifying party is responsible for a wide range of potential liabilities, including those that may not be capped under other provisions of the contract.

4. **Defense Obligations**: The clause also imposes a duty on the franchisee to defend the indemnitees against claims, which is particularly relevant in the context of personal or bodily injury claims. The franchisee must cover the costs of defense, which can be substantial in such cases.

5. **Potential for Liability Caps**: While the clause does not explicitly mention a cap on liability, the indemnification obligations could be seen as a way to carve out exceptions to any liability caps that might exist elsewhere in the contract. If there were a general cap on liability, the indemnification obligations for personal or bodily injury claims could effectively create an exception to that cap, as the franchisee would still be responsible for indemnifying the indemnitees for those claims.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the responsibilities of the franchisee to indemnify the franchisor for claims, including personal or bodily injury claims, while also providing a carveout for gross negligence. This structure can create exceptions to any liability caps that may be present in the broader contract, ensuring that the franchisor is protected from certain types of claims regardless of any limitations on liability.",5

The relevance of this clause to your query about a third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement exception to the cap on liability via indemnification carveout can be explained as follows:

1. **Exemption for IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that liability arising from Section 9.3, which pertains to intellectual property infringement, is an exception to the general limitations on liability. This means that if one party is found to infringe on a third party's intellectual property rights, they cannot rely on the limitations set forth in this clause to cap their liability. This is crucial for protecting the rights of third parties and ensuring that the party responsible for the infringement is held accountable.

2. **Indemnification Carveout**: The mention of liability arising from IP infringement suggests that there may be an indemnification obligation related to such claims. Typically, indemnification clauses require one party to compensate the other for losses or damages incurred due to specific actions, such as IP infringement. In this context, if a party is liable for infringing a third party's IP, they may be required to indemnify the other party for any resulting damages, legal fees, or other costs, which would not be subject to the liability cap.

3. **Impact on Liability Caps**: The clause indicates that, while there are caps on liability for general claims (e.g., indirect, special, incidental damages), these caps do not apply to claims related to IP infringement. This means that the parties can pursue full recovery for damages related to IP infringement without being limited by the financial caps that apply to other types of claims.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it establishes that liability for third-party IP infringement is not subject to the same limitations as other types of liability, thereby allowing for potential indemnification and full accountability for such claims. This ensures that parties are incentivized to respect intellectual property rights and provides a mechanism for addressing any infringement that may occur.",5

Here's how it relates to your query about a third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement exception to the cap on liability via an indemnification carveout:

1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The first part of the clause (12.1) establishes that neither party will be liable for incidental, consequential, indirect, special, or punitive damages. This is a common limitation in contracts to protect parties from extensive financial exposure due to unforeseen consequences of their actions.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: The second part of the clause (12.2) introduces exceptions to the general limitation of liability. It states that the cap on liability does not apply in cases of breaches of confidentiality, indemnification obligations, or infringement of intellectual property rights. This is crucial because it means that if one party infringes on a third party's intellectual property rights, the other party can seek indemnification without being limited by the cap on liability.

3. **Third-Party IP Infringement**: The mention of ""infringement of intellectual property rights"" in the exceptions indicates that if a party's actions lead to a claim of IP infringement by a third party, the affected party can pursue indemnification. This means that the party responsible for the infringement would be liable for any damages or costs incurred by the other party as a result of that infringement, regardless of the liability cap.

4. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause effectively serves as an indemnification carveout, allowing for full recovery of damages related to IP infringement claims. This is important for protecting the parties from the risks associated with third-party claims, ensuring that they are not financially limited in seeking redress for such serious issues.

Except in connection with a breach by either party of Article 7 or Section 8.1.5 [REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES] (v) and the indemnification obligations of Impresse under Section 9.4(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY IMPRESSE] and the indemnification obligations of VerticalNet under Section 9.5(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET], neither party will be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages arising out of or related to this Agreement, however caused and under any theory of liability (including negligence), even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.3, addresses the limitation of liability between the parties involved in the agreement. It establishes that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages arising from the agreement. 

In the context of your query regarding a ""third party IP infringement exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout,"" the relevant parts of the clause are the exceptions listed. The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply in connection with:

1. Breaches of Article 7 (which likely pertains to confidentiality or similar obligations).
2. Breach of Section 8.1.5, which relates to representations and warranties.
3. Indemnification obligations of Impresse under Section 9.4(i)(d).
4. Indemnification obligations of VerticalNet under Section 9.5(i)(d).

The indemnification obligations mentioned in the clause suggest that if either party is required to indemnify the other for certain claims (potentially including third-party intellectual property infringement claims), those indemnification obligations would not be subject to the liability cap. This means that if a third party claims that one party's actions infringe on their intellectual property rights, the indemnifying party would be responsible for those claims, and the limitation of liability would not apply to the damages arising from that indemnification.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query because it outlines the exceptions to the limitation of liability, specifically indicating that indemnification obligations related to third-party claims (such as IP infringement) are carved out from the liability cap, allowing for full recovery of damages in those scenarios.",5
third party IP infringement exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout,6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 13.4 on Limitation of Liability, is relevant to your query regarding a third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement exception to the cap on liability via an indemnification carveout for several reasons:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that it does not limit a Party's indemnification obligations. This is crucial because indemnification typically involves one party agreeing to compensate the other for certain losses or damages, including those arising from third-party claims. In the context of IP infringement, if one party's actions lead to a third-party claim of IP infringement, the indemnifying party may be required to cover the costs associated with that claim, including any damages awarded.

2. **Third Party Claims**: The clause mentions that the limitation of liability does not apply to damages awarded to a third party under a third-party claim. This means that if a third party successfully claims damages against one of the parties due to IP infringement, the party responsible for the infringement may be liable for those damages, regardless of the limitations set forth in the clause. This effectively carves out an exception to the general limitation of liability for situations involving third-party claims.

3. **Protection Against IP Infringement**: The clause indirectly highlights the importance of protecting against IP infringement claims. By allowing for indemnification in the event of a third-party claim, the parties are acknowledging the potential risks associated with IP rights and are agreeing to allocate responsibility for those risks through indemnification.

4. **Legal Compliance**: The clause also notes that the limitation of liability does not apply if it is contrary to applicable law. In many jurisdictions, laws may impose strict liability for IP infringement, meaning that parties cannot contractually limit their liability for such claims. This reinforces the idea that indemnification for third-party IP claims is necessary to comply with legal standards.

In summary, this clause establishes a framework where indemnification obligations remain intact, particularly in the context of third-party claims related to IP infringement. It ensures that parties are held accountable for such claims, thereby providing a safeguard against potential liabilities that could arise from IP issues.",5

Here’s how it relates to your query about a third-party IP infringement exception to the cap on liability via an indemnification carveout:

1. **Indemnification for IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that there are exceptions to the liability cap, particularly for breaches associated with the unauthorized use of intellectual property. This means that if one party infringes on a third party's intellectual property rights, they may be liable for damages that exceed the standard liability cap outlined in Section 11.3.

2. **Liability Cap**: Section 11.3 establishes a cap on liability, limiting the total aggregate liability of one party to the other to the amount of purchase prices paid in the preceding twelve months. However, this cap does not apply to claims related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional breaches, willful misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. This creates a carveout for IP-related claims, allowing for potentially unlimited liability in such cases.

3. **Protection Against Third-Party Claims**: The indemnification aspect implies that if a third party claims that one party has infringed on their intellectual property rights, the party responsible for the infringement may have to indemnify the other party for any resulting damages, costs, or liabilities. This is crucial for protecting the non-infringing party from financial loss due to third-party claims.

4. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: While the clause limits liability for special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or tort damages, it does not limit liability for IP infringement claims. This distinction is important because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious breaches related to intellectual property, which can have significant financial implications.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a clear exception to the liability cap for claims related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, thereby providing a safeguard against third-party IP infringement claims through an indemnification carveout. This ensures that parties are held accountable for IP-related breaches, regardless of the standard liability limitations set forth in the agreement.",5

### Key Points of Relevance:

1. **Exclusions from Liability Caps**:
   - **Section 11.6** specifies that certain types of damages are excluded from the limitation on liability. Specifically, it states that liability caps do not apply to claims arising from:
     - A party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (Section 11.6(E)).
     - Indemnification obligations under Article 12 (Section 11.6(F)).
   - This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the liability cap to limit their exposure to damages resulting from such actions.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**:
   - **Sections 12.1 and 12.2** outline the indemnification responsibilities of each party. They specify that each party will indemnify the other for claims arising from their own breaches, negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.
   - This reinforces the idea that if a party's actions fall into these categories, they are responsible for indemnifying the other party for any resulting claims or losses, regardless of the liability cap.

3. **Legal and Equitable Theories**:
   - The liability limit in **Section 11.7** is stated to apply under any legal or equitable theory, including breach of contract and tort. However, the exceptions for fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, and indemnification obligations mean that these actions can lead to liability beyond the stated cap.

### Conclusion:
The clause effectively carves out exceptions to the liability cap for serious misconduct (fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct) and for indemnification obligations. This means that if either party engages in such conduct, they cannot limit their liability, and they must indemnify the other party for any claims arising from that conduct. This is a critical aspect of the agreement, as it ensures accountability for serious breaches of duty and protects the parties from being limited in their recovery in such cases.",5

Here’s how it relates to your query:

1. **Exclusion from Liability Cap**: 
   - The clause explicitly states that the limitations on liability (as outlined in Section 11.7) do not apply in cases of a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if either party engages in such conduct, they cannot rely on the liability cap to limit their financial responsibility. This is a common legal principle to ensure that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: 
   - The clause also indicates that the limitations on liability do not apply to a party's indemnification obligations under Article 12. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for losses arising from claims related to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the indemnifying party cannot limit their liability based on the cap set forth in Section 11.7.

3. **Indemnification Carveout**: 
   - The indemnification provisions in Sections 12.1 and 12.2 further clarify that each party has an obligation to indemnify the other for claims arising from their own breaches, negligence, or misconduct. This reinforces the idea that parties are responsible for their actions, particularly when those actions involve serious wrongdoing.

4. **Legal and Equitable Theories**: 
   - The clause specifies that the liability cap applies under any legal or equitable theory, but again, it carves out exceptions for fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, and indemnification obligations. This comprehensive approach ensures that parties cannot evade accountability for serious breaches of duty.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes clear exceptions to the liability cap for serious misconduct and outlines the indemnification responsibilities of each party. This ensures that parties are held accountable for their actions, particularly in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, and that they cannot limit their liability in such circumstances.",5

### Breakdown of the Clause:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**:
   - This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, including lost profits or indirect damages, arising from the agreement. 
   - However, it explicitly carves out exceptions to this limitation, including:
     - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: This means that if a party engages in fraudulent behavior, acts with gross negligence, or commits willful misconduct, they cannot rely on this limitation to avoid liability for damages resulting from such actions.
     - **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also states that any claims related to a party's indemnification obligations are not subject to the limitation on consequential damages.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**:
   - This section sets a cap on the aggregate liability of each party under the agreement, specifying that liability is limited to a certain amount (denoted as [***]).
   - Similar to Section 11.6, it lists exceptions to this cap, including:
     - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: Again, if a party commits fraud, acts with gross negligence, or engages in willful misconduct, they cannot invoke the liability cap to limit their exposure to damages resulting from those actions.
     - **Indemnification Obligations**: The liability cap does not apply to claims arising from a party's indemnification obligations.

### Relevance to Your Query:
- The clause is relevant because it clearly outlines that in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the parties cannot limit their liability through the standard caps or exclusions typically found in contracts. This means that if one party engages in such conduct, they can be held fully liable for the resulting damages, regardless of the limitations set forth in the agreement.
- Additionally, the inclusion of indemnification obligations as an exception indicates that any claims related to indemnification are also not subject to the liability cap, ensuring that parties can seek full recovery for losses related to indemnification claims.

In summary, this clause effectively creates a safeguard against the potential misuse of liability limitations in cases of serious misconduct, ensuring accountability and protection for the parties involved.",5

9.2 For the purpose of this Section, """"liability"""" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause you provided is relevant to your query regarding the exceptions to the cap on liability, specifically in the context of indemnification and the carveouts for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

Here's a breakdown of how the clause addresses these points:

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This cap is intended to limit the financial exposure of the parties under the agreement.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: 
   - **Section 9.1.1** specifies that the Liability Cap does not apply to:
     - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).
     - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).
   This means that if one party breaches confidentiality or has indemnification obligations, they can be held liable beyond the established cap.

3. **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: 
   - **Section 9.1.2** explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to claims arising from intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence. This is crucial because it allows for full recovery of damages in cases where one party has acted with intent to deceive (fraud) or has been grossly negligent in their actions.

4. **Definition of Liability**: 
   - **Section 9.2** provides a broad definition of ""liability,"" encompassing various forms of claims and damages, which reinforces that the exceptions to the Liability Cap apply to a wide range of potential legal claims.

In summary, this clause effectively carves out exceptions to the Liability Cap for serious breaches of the agreement, including indemnification obligations and cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This ensures that parties cannot limit their liability in situations where they have acted in bad faith or failed to meet their obligations in a significant way.",5
"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout",0eabff6ea5,"14.4 Indemnification You shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent by law us, our affiliates and our respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, and agents, (collectively the ""Indemnitees"") from any and all losses and expenses (as hereinafter defined) incurred in connection with any litigation or other form of adjudicatory procedure, claim, demand, investigation, or formal or informal inquiry (regardless of whether same is reduced to judgment) or any settlement thereof which arises directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business including, but not limited to, claims arising as a result of the maintenance and operation of vehicles (collectively an ""event""), and regardless of whether same resulted from any strict or vicarious liability imposed by law on the Indemnitees; provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any liability arising from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees (except to the extent that joint liability is involved, in which event the indemnification provided herein shall extend to any finding of comparative negligence or contributory negligence attributable to you). For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel. Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 14.4 on Indemnification, is relevant to your query regarding the exceptions to caps on liability, particularly in the context of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause establishes an obligation for one party (the indemnitor) to indemnify and hold harmless the other party (the indemnitees) from various losses and expenses arising from claims related to the operation of the Franchised Business. This includes a broad range of potential liabilities, which can encompass claims of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

2. **Exclusion of Gross Negligence**: Importantly, the clause explicitly states that the indemnification obligation does not apply to liabilities arising from the gross negligence of the indemnitees. This means that if the indemnitees are found to be grossly negligent, they cannot seek indemnification from the indemnitor for those specific claims. This exclusion serves as a carve-out to the general indemnification obligation, effectively limiting the indemnitor's liability in cases of gross negligence.

3. **Implications for Liability Caps**: In many contracts, liability caps are established to limit the amount one party can recover from another. However, the presence of exceptions—such as those for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct—can create scenarios where these caps do not apply. In this clause, while gross negligence is excluded from indemnification, it does not explicitly mention fraud or willful misconduct. Therefore, if the indemnitees engage in fraudulent or willful misconduct, the indemnitor may still have grounds to pursue claims against them without being limited by the liability cap.

4. **Comprehensive Definition of Losses and Expenses**: The clause also defines ""losses and expenses"" broadly, including compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages, which can arise from claims of fraud or willful misconduct. This comprehensive definition ensures that the indemnitees are protected against a wide range of potential liabilities, reinforcing the importance of the indemnification provision.

5. **Defense and Settlement**: The clause outlines the process for defense and settlement of claims, indicating that the indemnitees can assume the defense of any claims and that the indemnitor must reimburse them for reasonable legal fees. This further emphasizes the indemnitor's responsibility to cover costs associated with claims, except in cases of gross negligence.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the conditions under which indemnification is provided, the exceptions to that indemnification (specifically gross negligence), and the implications for liability caps in the context of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

Without affecting Section 10 or the respective obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement and except for any liability (i) relating to any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property, (ii) arising from the intentional breach or willful misconduct of a party, or (iii) arising from the non-compliance with any mandatory applicable law or regulation, the total aggregate liability of one party to another party for any claim relating to any breach of this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) (a """"Claim"""") shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the purchase prices paid by Distributor to Accuray for Products pursuant to this Agreement (or any Purchase Order or other Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement) during the twelve calendar months preceding the date of the notification to the other party of such Claim less any amounts paid or payable in respect of any other Claim of which the other party was notified during such twelve month period.","The clause you provided is a liability cap clause, which is a common feature in contracts that limits the amount one party can recover from another in the event of a breach or other claims. In this case, the clause is particularly seller-favorable because it restricts the liability of the seller (Accuray) to a specific monetary limit.

Here’s how the clause is relevant to the query regarding seller-favorable caps on liability:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the total aggregate liability of Accuray (the seller) to the Distributor (the buyer) is capped at the amount of purchase prices paid by the Distributor for products in the twelve months preceding the claim. This means that, regardless of the nature or extent of the damages incurred by the Distributor, Accuray's financial exposure is limited to a relatively small amount compared to potential damages.

2. **Exclusions from Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, such as breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. While these exceptions are standard in many contracts, they still protect the seller from a wide range of claims, reinforcing the seller-favorable nature of the clause.

3. **Time Limitation**: By limiting the liability to the amounts paid in the twelve months prior to the claim, the clause further reduces the seller's risk. If a claim arises after a significant period, the seller may have received little to no revenue from the buyer, thus minimizing potential liability.

4. **Encouragement of Business**: Such a cap can encourage sellers to enter into agreements with buyers, knowing that their financial risk is limited. This can be particularly attractive in industries where the potential for large claims exists.

In summary, this liability cap clause is relevant to the query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable approach by limiting the seller's financial exposure in the event of a breach, while also providing certain protections against significant claims.",5
seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,f52cb3b7ad,"IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER’S OR SELLER’S LIABILITY, ONE TO THE OTHER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE RESPECTIVE OTHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD 13 MILLION; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BAD FAITH, INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding seller-favorable caps on liability because it establishes a limitation on the amount of damages that either party (the Buyer or the Seller) can claim against the other in the event of a breach of the agreement. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of a seller-favorable cap on liability:

1. **Cap on Liability**: The clause sets a specific monetary limit (USD 13 million) on the liability of both parties. This is a common practice in contracts to manage risk and exposure to potential damages. A seller-favorable cap typically means that the cap is set at a level that is more advantageous to the seller, potentially limiting their exposure to claims.

2. **Mutual Limitation**: While the clause applies to both parties, the fact that it includes a cap can be seen as favorable to the seller if the seller's potential liabilities are limited to a specific amount. This can protect the seller from excessive claims that could arise from breaches, especially in high-stakes transactions.

3. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause also specifies exceptions to the cap, such as claims arising from bad faith, intentional misconduct, or third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. While these exceptions are standard in many contracts, they can be particularly important for sellers, as they ensure that the seller is not shielded from liability in cases of serious wrongdoing.

4. **Risk Management**: By establishing a cap, the clause helps both parties manage their risk exposure. For sellers, this can be particularly important in industries where potential liabilities can be significant, allowing them to conduct business with a clearer understanding of their financial exposure.

In summary, this clause exemplifies a seller-favorable cap on liability by limiting the seller's financial exposure in the event of a breach while also providing a framework for addressing serious misconduct and third-party claims.",5
seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,ff35aa7411,"9. Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties waive and relinquish any claims, demands, causes of action or recoveries for punitive damages, exemplary damages, or statutory damages. Seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the sale of the products, including any lost revenues or profits, consequential and/or incidental damages, business interruption or damage to business reputation, regardless of the theory upon which any claim may be based, including any statutory causes of action or claims. In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","The clause you've provided is a ""Limitation of Liability"" clause that is designed to protect the seller by limiting their potential liability in various circumstances. This is particularly relevant to your query about seller-favorable caps on liability clauses. Here’s how it aligns with that concept:

1. **Waiver of Certain Damages**: The clause begins by stating that the parties waive claims for punitive, exemplary, or statutory damages. This is favorable to the seller because it eliminates the possibility of facing significant financial penalties that could arise from a breach of contract or other legal claims.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect and Consequential Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the seller is not liable for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that if the buyer suffers losses that are not directly tied to the product itself (such as lost profits or damage to business reputation), the seller cannot be held responsible. This significantly limits the seller's exposure to large claims that could arise from unforeseen consequences of their products.

3. **Cap on Liability**: The clause caps the seller's total liability to the purchase price actually paid by the buyer for the products, or the defective portion thereof, whichever is lesser. This is a clear seller-favorable provision because it ensures that the seller's maximum financial exposure is limited to the amount the buyer has already paid, regardless of the nature or extent of the buyer's claims.

4. **Protection Against Failure of Remedy**: The clause also states that even if the exclusive remedy fails to achieve its essential purpose, the seller's liability is still capped at the purchase price. This further protects the seller by ensuring that they cannot be held liable for more than the agreed-upon price, even in cases where the buyer may argue that the remedy provided in the contract is insufficient.

In summary, this clause is highly favorable to the seller as it limits their liability in multiple ways, reducing the risk of significant financial loss due to claims arising from the sale of their products. It effectively caps their exposure and waives certain types of damages, aligning with the goal of creating a seller-friendly contractual environment.",5

Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause you provided outlines a limitation of liability between Fiserv and the Merchant, which is a common feature in contracts to manage risk and exposure to potential losses. In the context of your query regarding ""seller-favorable cap on liability clauses,"" this clause can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a cap on the aggregate liability of both parties (Fiserv and the Merchant) at AUD 50,000. This means that regardless of the nature of the claim or the legal theory invoked, neither party can be held liable for more than this specified amount. This is a seller-favorable provision because it limits the potential financial exposure of the seller (in this case, Fiserv) to a predetermined amount.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause specifies certain exceptions where the liability cap does not apply. These exceptions include:
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds to the Merchant, which is a critical obligation and ensures that the Merchant receives its due payments.
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations related to services, network security fees, and regulatory penalties due to non-performance. This means that the Merchant remains fully liable for these specific obligations, which can be seen as a seller-favorable aspect for Fiserv, as it protects its interests in receiving payments and compliance with regulations.

3. **Risk Allocation**: By capping liability and excluding certain obligations from that cap, the clause effectively allocates risk between the parties. The seller (Fiserv) is protected from excessive claims that could arise from various actions or failures, while still ensuring that the Merchant is accountable for its financial obligations.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable cap on liability by limiting the seller's (Fiserv's) exposure while maintaining certain obligations that ensure the seller's financial interests are protected. This type of clause is often negotiated to balance the interests of both parties, but in this case, it leans towards favoring the seller.",5

(e) The remedies set forth in this Section 7 are exclusive, and no other remedy or remedies are available to Buyer, whether in law or equity. Buyer and Seller agree that the remedies contained herein are adequate remedies.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query about seller-favorable caps on liability clauses because it outlines the limitations on the seller's liability in a contractual agreement. Here’s how it aligns with the concept of a seller-favorable cap on liability:

1. **Maximum Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the seller's maximum liability for all claims is limited to the invoice price of the product(s) involved. This is a clear cap on the seller's financial exposure, which is favorable to the seller because it restricts the amount they could potentially owe in the event of a claim.

2. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause further specifies that neither party will be liable for various types of damages, including special, incidental, punitive, consequential, indirect, or exemplary damages. This exclusion is particularly beneficial to the seller, as it protects them from having to compensate the buyer for losses that are not directly related to the product itself, such as lost profits or business opportunities.

3. **Exclusive Remedies**: The clause states that the remedies provided in this section are exclusive, meaning that the buyer cannot seek other remedies outside of what is specified in the contract. This limits the buyer's options for recourse and reinforces the seller's position by ensuring that the seller's liability is confined to the terms laid out in the agreement.

Overall, this clause is designed to minimize the seller's risk and liability, making it a seller-favorable provision in the contract. It effectively protects the seller from extensive financial repercussions while providing a clear framework for addressing claims related to the product.",5

This is relevant to your query about buyer-favorable caps on liability clauses for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause specifies that the liability of the Distributor is capped at the total amount of purchase prices paid to Accuray for products over the preceding twelve months. This is a common practice in contracts to protect the party providing the goods or services (Accuray) from excessive financial exposure. However, from a buyer's perspective, this cap can be seen as unfavorable because it limits the potential recovery for the buyer in the event of a significant breach.

2. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause lists specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, such as breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. While these exceptions are important for protecting the buyer's interests in serious situations, the overall cap still restricts the buyer's ability to claim damages for other breaches, which may be seen as a disadvantage.

3. **Time Frame for Claims**: The clause limits the liability to claims arising from breaches that occurred within a specific time frame (the twelve months preceding the claim notification). This can be unfavorable for buyers who may discover issues that arose earlier than this period, as they would not be able to seek compensation for those claims.

4. **Buyer-Favorable Considerations**: For a clause to be considered buyer-favorable, it would typically allow for higher liability limits or no caps at all for certain types of breaches, especially those that could cause significant harm to the buyer. In this case, the cap on liability may not align with buyer-favorable terms, as it restricts the buyer's potential recovery.

In summary, while the clause serves to limit liability for the seller (Accuray), it may not be favorable to the buyer (Distributor) due to the imposed cap, the exclusions, and the time limitations on claims. A buyer-favorable cap on liability would ideally provide more extensive protections and higher recovery limits for the buyer in the event of breaches.",4

In the context of your query regarding ""buyer-favorable cap on liability clauses,"" this clause is relevant for several reasons:

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a specific cap on the aggregate liability of both parties, set at AUD 50,000. This means that, regardless of the circumstances or legal theories involved, neither party can claim damages exceeding this amount. This cap can be seen as a protective measure for both parties, but it may not be particularly favorable to the buyer (the Merchant) if the potential losses exceed this amount.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause specifies certain exceptions where the liability cap does not apply. For instance, Fiserv's obligation to remit transaction proceeds and the Merchant's payment obligations related to services are excluded from the cap. This means that in these specific situations, the Merchant could be liable for amounts exceeding the AUD 50,000 cap, which could be unfavorable for the Merchant.

3. **Risk Allocation**: The clause reflects a risk allocation strategy between the parties. While it limits liability, it also delineates responsibilities and potential financial exposure. For a buyer (the Merchant), this could be seen as a disadvantage if the exclusions lead to significant financial exposure in the event of a breach or failure to perform.

4. **Negotiation Considerations**: If the Merchant is seeking a more buyer-favorable position, they might negotiate for a higher liability cap or broader coverage under the cap, ensuring that more potential losses are covered. They might also seek to limit the exclusions to reduce their financial risk.

In summary, while the clause provides a clear limitation on liability, it may not be favorable to the buyer due to the low cap and the specific exclusions that could expose them to greater financial risk.

2. **Buyer-Favorable Aspects**: While the clause applies equally to both parties, the cap can be considered buyer-favorable if the buyer is in a stronger negotiating position or if the buyer's potential damages are likely to exceed this cap. If the buyer anticipates that their losses could be significantly higher than USD 13 million due to the seller's breach, this cap may be seen as limiting the seller's liability in a way that protects the buyer's interests.

3. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause includes exceptions where the cap does not apply, specifically for claims arising from bad faith, intentional misconduct, or third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. This is particularly relevant for the buyer, as it allows them to pursue full damages in cases of serious misconduct by the seller, which could be critical in protecting the buyer's interests.

4. **Risk Allocation**: The clause reflects a negotiated balance of risk between the buyer and seller. A buyer-favorable cap would typically ensure that the buyer is not unduly exposed to risks that could arise from the seller's actions, while still providing a clear limit on liability for less severe breaches.

It is particularly relevant to the query about buyer-favorable caps on liability clauses for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Seller's Liability**: The clause explicitly limits the seller's liability to either the replacement of goods/services or a refund of the purchase price. This is a common practice in contracts to protect sellers from extensive financial exposure. However, from a buyer's perspective, this can be unfavorable as it restricts the remedies available to them in case of defects or issues with the goods/services.

2. **Cap on Damages**: The clause states that the seller's liability for any loss or damage to the buyer is capped at the aggregate purchase price of the goods or services in question. This means that regardless of the extent of the buyer's damages, they cannot recover more than what they paid. This is a significant limitation that can be seen as unfavorable to the buyer, especially if the damages incurred exceed the purchase price.

3. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**: The clause also includes a broad exclusion of consequential, special, incidental, indirect, or punitive damages. This further limits the buyer's ability to claim damages that may arise from the seller's breach, which can be particularly detrimental if the buyer suffers significant losses as a result of the seller's failure to deliver goods or services as warranted.

4. **Survival of Limitations**: The clause states that the limitations of liability will survive the termination, expiration, or cancellation of the agreement. This means that even after the contract ends, the buyer's remedies remain limited, which can be unfavorable for the buyer.

5. **No Third-Party Liability**: The clause specifies that the seller has no liability to any person other than the buyer. This means that if the buyer's customers or other third parties suffer damages due to the goods/services, they cannot hold the seller liable, which can further limit the buyer's recourse.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query about buyer-favorable caps on liability because it illustrates how liability limitations can be structured in a way that heavily favors the seller, potentially leaving the buyer with inadequate remedies in the event of a dispute or issue with the goods or services provided. For a buyer, negotiating more favorable terms, such as higher caps on liability or the inclusion of consequential damages, would be essential to mitigate these risks.",5

Here’s a breakdown of its significance:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause protects the parties involved in the agreement from any claims or liabilities that may arise from third parties who might attempt to rely on the statements made in the contract. By stating that no third party is entitled to rely on these representations, the parties are effectively limiting their exposure to potential legal claims.

2. **Clarity of Intent**: This clause clarifies the intent of the parties that the agreement is strictly between them and does not extend any rights or benefits to third parties. This is important in contractual relationships to ensure that only the parties to the contract can enforce its terms.

3. **Prevention of Misinterpretation**: By including a non-reliance clause, the parties aim to prevent any misinterpretation or misunderstanding by third parties regarding the nature of the agreement. It makes it clear that any representations made are not intended for the benefit of anyone other than the parties to the contract.

4. **Legal Protection**: In the event of a dispute, this clause can serve as a legal defense for the parties if a third party claims they were misled or harmed by relying on the contract. It reinforces the idea that the contract is not a basis for claims by those outside the agreement.

In summary, the non-reliance clause is a critical component of the contract that helps to define the scope of liability and the intended audience for the representations made within the agreement, thereby protecting the parties from unintended consequences related to third-party reliance.",5

This clause is intended to prevent one party from claiming that they were misled or induced to enter into the contract based on external statements or assurances that are not documented in the agreement.

In the clause you provided, while it does not explicitly mention ""non-reliance,"" it contains elements that are relevant to the concept:

1. **Benefit of the Parties**: The clause states that the agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties involved. This implies that only the parties to the contract have rights and obligations under it, which aligns with the idea that they should not rely on external representations.

2. **No Assignment or Delegation**: The clause also specifies that no party may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under the agreement. This reinforces the notion that the agreement is a private contract between the specified parties, and any reliance on third parties or external representations is not permitted.

Overall, while the clause does not explicitly serve as a non-reliance clause, it supports the principle by emphasizing that the agreement is limited to the parties involved and that they should not rely on any outside statements or promises.

1. **Exclusion of Implied Representations**: The clause explicitly states that no representations or warranties are made except those that are expressly included in the agreement. This means that parties cannot rely on any statements or assurances that are not documented in the contract. This is a key aspect of a non-reliance clause, as it protects the parties from claims based on alleged representations that were not formally included in the agreement.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: By excluding all representations and warranties not expressly stated, the clause limits the liability of the parties. If one party were to make a claim based on an implied representation, this clause would serve as a defense, asserting that the other party should not have relied on any such representation.

3. **Clarity and Certainty**: The clause promotes clarity and certainty in the contractual relationship by ensuring that all parties are aware that their obligations and expectations are strictly defined by the terms of the agreement. This reduces the risk of misunderstandings or disputes arising from informal discussions or representations made outside the contract.

4. **Legal Protection**: In the event of a dispute, this clause provides legal protection to the parties by establishing a clear boundary around what is considered a binding representation or warranty. Courts often uphold such clauses, reinforcing the principle that parties should rely only on what is written in the contract.

Except as set forth in paragraphs 9(a) through 9(d) inclusive of this agreement, with respect to its EDP services or other work provided under this agreement, VIP makes no warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose except as set forth in paragraphs 9(a) through 9(d) inclusive of this agreement, VIP does not warrant that the services shall meet BNL's requirements or that the services shall be uninterrupted or error-free.","The clause you provided contains elements that are relevant to a non-reliance clause, although it does not explicitly state ""non-reliance."" A non-reliance clause typically serves to clarify that one party is not relying on any representations or warranties made by the other party outside of what is explicitly stated in the contract. 

In the context of the clause you provided, it emphasizes that VIP makes no warranties regarding its EDP (Electronic Data Processing) services or other work provided under the agreement, except for the specific warranties outlined in paragraphs 9(a) through 9(d). This means that BNL (the other party) cannot rely on any implied warranties or representations that are not expressly included in those specified paragraphs. 

Key points of relevance include:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause limits VIP's liability by stating that it does not guarantee that its services will meet BNL's requirements or be free from interruptions or errors. This aligns with the purpose of a non-reliance clause, which is to protect the party from claims based on expectations that are not supported by the contract.

2. **Express vs. Implied Warranties**: By stating that VIP makes no express or implied warranties, the clause reinforces the idea that BNL should not rely on any assurances beyond what is explicitly stated in the contract. This is a core principle of non-reliance.

3. **Clarity and Certainty**: The clause provides clarity regarding the scope of the services and the limitations of VIP's obligations, which is a fundamental aspect of non-reliance clauses. It ensures that BNL understands the extent of what it can expect from VIP.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly mention ""non-reliance,"" it effectively serves a similar purpose by limiting the warranties and representations that BNL can rely upon, thereby protecting VIP from potential claims based on unexpressed expectations.",5

ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED.","The clause you provided is a non-reliance clause, which serves to limit the liability of the parties involved in the agreement regarding any representations or warranties that are not explicitly stated in the contract. Here’s how it relates to the concept of non-reliance:

1. **Exclusion of Implied Representations**: The clause explicitly states that no representations or warranties are made beyond what is expressly stated in the agreement. This means that parties cannot rely on any statements or assurances that are not included in the contract. This is a key aspect of a non-reliance clause, as it protects the parties from claims based on alleged representations that were not formally documented.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: By excluding all representations and warranties, the clause limits the liability of the parties for any claims that may arise from reliance on statements not included in the agreement. This is particularly important in commercial contracts, where parties may seek to hold each other accountable for statements made during negotiations or discussions that are not reflected in the final written agreement.

3. **Clarity and Certainty**: The clause provides clarity and certainty to the parties by establishing that the only representations and warranties that matter are those that are explicitly stated in the contract. This helps to avoid disputes over what was said or implied outside of the written agreement.

4. **Legal Protection**: In the event of a dispute, this clause can serve as a legal defense for a party that is accused of making misleading statements or failing to disclose information. It reinforces the idea that parties should conduct their own due diligence and not rely on any external representations.

In summary, this non-reliance clause is relevant because it clearly delineates the boundaries of what parties can rely on in the context of the agreement, thereby protecting them from potential claims based on unrecorded representations or warranties.",5

1. **Definition of ""As-Is""**: The clause explicitly states that the materials and services are provided on an ""as-is"" basis. This means that the receiving party accepts the materials and services in their existing state, with all faults and without any assurances from the providing party.

2. **Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause goes further to clarify that, aside from any express representations made in the agreement, no party is making any representations or warranties, either express or implied. This includes disclaiming implied warranties of merchantability (that the goods are fit for sale) and fitness for a particular purpose (that the goods are suitable for the specific use intended by the buyer).

3. **Risk Allocation**: By including an ""as-is"" clause, the parties are allocating risk. The receiving party assumes the risk associated with the condition and performance of the materials and services, which can protect the providing party from liability for defects or issues that may arise after the transfer.

4. **Legal Implications**: The inclusion of an ""as-is"" clause can limit the legal recourse available to the receiving party if they later find that the materials or services do not meet their expectations or needs. It emphasizes the importance of due diligence before entering into the agreement.

Here’s a breakdown of the key points related to the ""as-is"" clause:

1. **No Additional Warranties**: The clause begins by stating that, aside from what is specifically mentioned in the agreement or agreed upon in writing, there are no additional warranties provided. This reinforces the idea that the services are being accepted without any further assurances.

2. **""As Is"" Provision**: The phrase ""as is"" indicates that the services are provided in their current condition, and the recipient of the services cannot expect any guarantees regarding their performance or quality. This is a common legal phrase used to limit liability.

3. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause explicitly excludes any implied warranties, such as those related to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. This means that the parties cannot claim that the services will meet certain standards or be suitable for specific uses.

4. **Scope of Services**: The clause details the types of services covered (e.g., advertisements, sponsorships, integrated branded search engines) and clarifies that there are no guarantees regarding their operation, including uninterrupted or error-free performance.

5. **Legal Protection**: By including this clause, the service providers (MLX and HCI) protect themselves from potential legal claims that could arise from dissatisfaction with the services, as they have clearly stated that they are not responsible for any issues.

Here's how this clause relates to the concept of an ""as-is"" clause:

1. **Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause explicitly states that the parties disclaim all representations and warranties, both express and implied. This is a hallmark of an ""as-is"" clause, which indicates that the buyer or user accepts the item or rights in their current state without any guarantees about their quality or performance.

2. **Specific Exclusions**: The clause mentions specific types of warranties that are disclaimed, such as implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose. This specificity reinforces the ""as-is"" nature of the agreement, as it clarifies that the parties are not providing any assurances regarding these important legal and commercial standards.

3. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause also limits the liability of the parties concerning the use of the trademarks and name and appearance rights. This is consistent with an ""as-is"" approach, where the party providing the rights is not held responsible for any negative outcomes that may arise from their use.

4. **No Liability for Damages**: The clause states that the parties shall not be liable for special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use of the trademarks and rights. This further emphasizes the ""as-is"" nature, as it protects the provider from claims related to the quality or performance of what is being provided.

This protects the licensor from liability if the licensee finds defects or issues after the fact.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause goes further to exclude any implied warranties that might arise under law, such as the implied warranties of merchantability (that the product is of average acceptable quality) and fitness for a particular purpose (that the product will meet the specific needs of the user). This means that the licensee cannot claim that the licensor is responsible for any shortcomings.

3. **Risk Assumption**: By agreeing to an ""as-is"" clause, the licensee assumes the risk associated with the use of the licensed material. They acknowledge that they are accepting the material in its current state, regardless of any potential defects or issues.

4. **Legal Protection for the Licensor**: This clause serves as a legal safeguard for the licensor, limiting their liability and protecting them from claims that may arise from the use of the licensed material.

1. **Definition of ""As-Is""**: The phrase ""as-is"" indicates that the services are being provided without any guarantees or warranties regarding their quality, performance, or suitability for a particular purpose. This means that the customer accepts the services in their current state, with all existing faults or limitations.

2. **Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause explicitly states that Kubient disclaims all representations and warranties, both express and implied, except for those specifically mentioned in the agreement.

3. **Waiver of Rights**: The clause also indicates that the customer waives any rights to claims based on implied warranties, such as merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. This further emphasizes that the customer is accepting the services without any assurances from Kubient.

4. **No Guarantee of Results**: The clause concludes with a statement that there is no guarantee of any minimum level of revenue or profit resulting from the services. This is a critical aspect of the ""as-is"" clause, as it clarifies that the customer should not expect specific outcomes from the services provided.

Here’s a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **""As Is"" Provision**: The clause explicitly states that the services provided by Cargill are offered ""as is."" This means that Cargill is not providing any guarantees regarding the quality, performance, or suitability of the services. The recipient (Bioamber) accepts the services in their current state, without any assurances from Cargill.

2. **Carveouts**: The phrase ""Except as provided in Section 1.2 of this Development Agreement"" serves as a carveout. This indicates that there may be specific exceptions or conditions outlined in Section 1.2 that could modify or provide certain warranties or representations. In legal terms, a carveout allows for specific provisions to exist that may contradict the general ""as is"" statement, thereby providing some level of assurance or warranty in certain circumstances.

3. **Responsibility and Accountability**: The clause further emphasizes that Bioamber acknowledges its responsibility for evaluating, approving, and implementing the results of the services. This reinforces the ""as is"" nature of the services, as it places the onus on Bioamber to assess the outcomes without relying on Cargill for guarantees.

In summary, this clause effectively communicates that while Cargill is providing services without warranties (the ""as is"" aspect), there may be specific exceptions noted elsewhere in the agreement (the carveouts), and it clarifies the responsibilities of Bioamber in relation to those services.

1. **""As Is"" Basis**: The clause explicitly states that the materials and services are provided on an ""as is"" basis. This means that the parties are agreeing that they accept the materials and services in their current state, without any guarantees or warranties regarding their quality, performance, or suitability for a particular purpose.

2. **Carveouts**: The phrase ""EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT"" serves as a carveout. This indicates that while the general rule is that no representations or warranties are made, there may be specific provisions within the agreement that do provide certain representations or warranties.

This clause shall survive termination of this JSMA.","The clause you provided is an indemnification clause, which outlines the responsibilities of Vertex and Bunker One to indemnify each other for certain types of damages or losses that may arise during the performance of their contractual obligations. 

In the context of your query regarding an ""as is"" clause with carveouts, here's how this indemnification clause is relevant:

1. **""As Is"" Clause**: An ""as is"" clause typically indicates that one party is accepting the subject matter of the contract in its current condition, without any warranties or guarantees from the other party. This means that the buyer or receiving party acknowledges that they are taking on the risk associated with the condition of the item or service.

2. **Carveouts**: Carveouts in an ""as is"" clause refer to specific exceptions where the seller or providing party may still be liable for certain issues, despite the ""as is"" acceptance. These carveouts often include situations involving negligence, fraud, or breaches of specific representations or warranties.

3. **Relevance of the Indemnification Clause**: The indemnification clause you provided serves as a form of carveout from an ""as is"" clause. It specifies that even if the parties agree to an ""as is"" condition, they will still be liable for damages resulting from their own negligence, gross negligence, or intentional misconduct. This means that if either Vertex or Bunker One engages in wrongful conduct that leads to damages, they cannot rely on the ""as is"" clause to avoid liability.

In summary, the indemnification clause complements the ""as is"" clause by ensuring that both parties remain accountable for their actions, particularly in cases of negligence or intentional wrongdoing, thereby providing a level of protection for both parties despite the acceptance of the subject matter in its current condition.",5

Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors, agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.","The clause you provided outlines the Sponsor's Maximum Obligation and includes an indemnification provision from Racing to the Sponsor. While it does not explicitly contain an ""as is"" clause, it can be relevant to the concept of ""as is"" with carveouts in the following ways:

1. **""As Is"" Concept**: An ""as is"" clause typically indicates that one party is accepting the subject matter (e.g., goods, services, or property) in its current condition, without any warranties or guarantees from the other party. In this context, if Racing were to include an ""as is"" clause, it would mean that the Sponsor accepts the sponsorship arrangement without any assurances regarding the performance or outcomes of Racing's obligations.

2. **Carveouts**: Carveouts in an ""as is"" clause refer to specific exceptions where the accepting party may still have recourse or protection. In the clause you provided, the indemnification from Racing to the Sponsor serves as a carveout. It states that Racing will indemnify the Sponsor for any losses or liabilities that exceed the Maximum Obligation, particularly in cases where Racing fails to perform its obligations. This means that even if the Sponsor accepts the agreement ""as is,"" they are still protected against certain risks that arise from Racing's non-performance.

3. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause limits Racing's liability to the Maximum Obligation, which is a key aspect of an ""as is"" arrangement. It establishes a cap on what the Sponsor can claim, while the indemnification provision provides a safety net for specific situations where Racing's actions (or inactions) lead to losses beyond that cap.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly state an ""as is"" provision, it embodies the principles of such a clause by limiting the Sponsor's obligations and providing indemnification for certain risks, effectively creating a framework where the Sponsor accepts the arrangement with specific protections in place.",4

This means that the parties are not making any guarantees about the quality, performance, or suitability of the trademarks and rights for any specific purpose.

2. **Carveouts**: The clause includes specific disclaimers and limitations that can be considered carveouts. For example, it explicitly mentions that the parties do not warrant against certain issues such as title, non-infringement of intellectual property rights, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose. These carveouts clarify that while the general ""as is"" disclaimer applies, there are specific areas where the parties are not providing any assurances.

3. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause also states that the parties shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use of the trademarks and rights, including special, consequential, or punitive damages.

### Explanation:

1. **""As Is"" Concept**: An ""as is"" clause typically indicates that the buyer accepts the item or property in its current state, with all existing faults and without any warranties from the seller regarding its condition or performance. This means the buyer cannot later claim that the seller misrepresented the condition of the item.

This means that the parties are agreeing that there are no additional warranties or representations, either express or implied, that could be claimed outside of what is written in the contract.

3. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause specifically mentions the exclusion of implied warranties such as merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This is significant because it reinforces the idea that the buyer cannot rely on any implied assurances about the quality or suitability of the subject matter, similar to an ""as is"" acceptance.

4. **Limitation of Liability**: By including this clause, the party making the representations is limiting their liability for any issues that may arise after the agreement is executed. This is akin to an ""as is"" clause, where the buyer assumes the risk associated with the condition of the item.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the clause you provided functions similarly to an unqualified ""as is"" clause by clearly stating that the only representations that matter are those explicitly included in the agreement, and it disclaims any other warranties or representations. This protects the party making the representations from future claims related to the condition or performance of the subject matter, aligning with the principles of an ""as is"" transaction.",5

3. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause goes further to exclude implied warranties, such as those of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

This disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty set forth above fails of its essential purpose.","The clause you provided is a ""Disclaimer of Warranty"" that addresses the waiver of implied warranties, including the implied warranty of title and non-infringement. Here's how it relates to your query:

1. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause explicitly states that all express or implied warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, are excluded to the extent allowed by applicable law. This means that the party providing the warranty (in this case, Cisco) is not responsible for any implied warranties that might otherwise arise in the absence of a specific agreement.

2. **Implied Warranty of Title**: The implied warranty of title generally ensures that the seller has the right to sell the goods and that the goods are free from any security interest or lien. By disclaiming this warranty, Cisco is indicating that it does not guarantee that it holds clear title to the products being sold, which could be significant in cases where ownership or rights to the product are contested.

3. **Implied Warranty of Non-Infringement**: This warranty typically assures that the goods sold do not infringe on any third-party intellectual property rights. The disclaimer indicates that Cisco is not liable for any claims of infringement that may arise from the use of its products, effectively waiving this implied warranty.

4. **Limitation of Duration**: The clause also mentions that if an implied warranty cannot be excluded, it is limited in duration to the warranty period specified in the agreement. This means that even if some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, the duration of any such warranty is restricted.

5. **Legal Rights**: The clause concludes by stating that the warranty gives the customer specific legal rights, which may vary by jurisdiction. This is important because it acknowledges that while the implied warranties are waived, customers may still have rights under local laws that could provide some level of protection.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the waiver of implied warranties, including those related to title and non-infringement, thereby limiting the liability of the party providing the warranty and clarifying the legal rights of the customer.",5
waiver of implied warranty of title and non-infringement,7bd6ea1f6e,"Seller warrants that at the time and place of delivery all Products sold hereunder shall conform to the
written specifications, if any, provided to Buyer by Seller in an Exhibit attached to this Agreement. Seller makes no other

particular purpose, non-infringement of any intellectual property right of any third party, or warranties as to quality or
correspondence with prior description or sample, and Buyer assumes all risk and liability whatsoever resulting from the
use of such materials, whether used singly or in combination with other substances.
Buyer shall examine and test the Products upon receipt. Before Products are used and within 30 days from receipt of
shipment or such longer period of time as is required by applicable law, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of any claims on
account of quality, loss, damage, or otherwise. Failure to so notify Seller shall constitute a waiver by Buyer of all claims with
respect to such Products.","The clause you provided addresses the waiver of implied warranties, specifically the implied warranty of title and non-infringement, which is relevant to your query. Here's how it connects:

1. **Waiver of Implied Warranties**: The clause explicitly states that the Seller makes no warranties of any kind, express or implied, beyond what is specified in the agreement. This includes waiving the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which are common in sales contracts. By including this language, the Seller limits their liability and protects themselves from claims related to these implied warranties.

2. **Non-Infringement**: The clause specifically mentions the waiver of the implied warranty of non-infringement of any intellectual property rights of third parties. This means that the Seller is not guaranteeing that the Products sold do not infringe on any third-party intellectual property rights. If the Buyer uses the Products and faces any legal issues related to infringement, the Buyer assumes all risks and liabilities, as stated in the clause.

3. **Buyer's Responsibilities**: The clause also outlines the Buyer's responsibilities regarding the examination and testing of the Products upon receipt. The Buyer must notify the Seller of any claims related to quality or other issues within a specified timeframe. If the Buyer fails to do so, they waive their right to make any claims regarding those Products. This further emphasizes the limited nature of the Seller's warranties and the Buyer's assumption of risk.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it clearly outlines the Seller's waiver of implied warranties, including the warranty of title and non-infringement, and establishes the Buyer's responsibilities in relation to the Products. This legal language is designed to protect the Seller from liability while placing the onus on the Buyer to ensure they are satisfied with the Products and to address any issues promptly.",5

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.","The clause you provided is a warranty disclaimer that limits the scope of warranties provided by the parties involved in the agreement. It states that, aside from any express warranties explicitly mentioned in the agreement, neither party is making any representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. This includes common warranties such as those related to merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

In relation to your query about a warranty disclaimer that does not specifically waive title and non-infringement warranties, the clause is relevant because it does not explicitly mention a waiver of title or non-infringement warranties. Instead, it broadly disclaims all warranties except those expressly stated in the agreement. 

This means that while the clause disclaims many implied warranties, it does not specifically address or waive the warranties of title (the guarantee that the seller has the right to transfer ownership of the goods) and non-infringement (the assurance that the goods do not infringe on third-party rights). Therefore, if the parties wish to retain those specific warranties, they would need to ensure that they are explicitly included in the agreement or that the disclaimer does not apply to them.

In summary, the clause serves as a general disclaimer of warranties but does not specifically address the waiving of title and non-infringement warranties, which aligns with your request for a disclaimer that does not waive those specific warranties.",5

FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause you provided is a warranty disclaimer that outlines the limitations of the warranties provided by the parties in the agreement. It is relevant to your query regarding a warranty disclaimer that does not specifically waive title and non-infringement warranties for the following reasons:

1. **General Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause begins by stating that the representations and warranties in the agreement are the only ones that apply, effectively limiting the scope of any additional warranties. This aligns with the intent to create a clear boundary around what warranties are being offered.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause explicitly disclaims all other warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This is a common practice in contracts to limit liability and clarify the expectations of the parties.

3. **Specific Mention of Non-Infringement**: The clause includes a specific disclaimer of any warranties of non-infringement that are not expressly set forth in the agreement. This is particularly relevant to your query because it indicates that while the parties are disclaiming certain warranties, they are not waiving all warranties related to non-infringement. This means that if there are specific non-infringement warranties included elsewhere in the agreement, they would still be valid and enforceable.

4. **Title Warranties**: While the clause does not explicitly mention title warranties, it does not negate them either. If the agreement includes a specific provision regarding title, that warranty would still stand, as the disclaimer does not encompass all possible warranties but rather focuses on those that are not expressly included.

In summary, this clause effectively limits the warranties to those expressly stated in the agreement while allowing for the possibility of certain warranties, such as title and specific non-infringement warranties, to remain intact if they are explicitly included elsewhere in the contract. This aligns with your request for a disclaimer that does not waive title and non-infringement warranties.",5

1. **General Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause begins with a broad disclaimer of all representations, conditions, and warranties, which includes both express and implied warranties. This is a common practice in contracts to limit liability and clarify the extent of the warranties being provided.

2. **Specific Exclusions**: The clause explicitly states that Cisco disclaims warranties related to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and other implied warranties. However, it does not specifically mention the waiver of title and non-infringement warranties. This is significant because it indicates that while many warranties are disclaimed, the clause does not address the ownership of intellectual property or proprietary rights, nor does it waive any claims related to infringement or misappropriation.

3. **Intellectual Property and Infringement**: The latter part of the clause specifically states that Cisco makes no representation or warranty regarding ownership of intellectual property or infringement. This means that while Cisco is disclaiming many warranties, it is not waiving its responsibility regarding title (ownership) and non-infringement claims. This is crucial for the distributor, as it preserves their rights in these areas.

4. **Limitation of Remedies**: The clause also outlines that the distributor's sole and exclusive remedies for any claims of infringement or misappropriation are defined in another section of the agreement. This further emphasizes that while many warranties are disclaimed, there are still specific remedies available for issues related to title and infringement.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query because it provides a warranty disclaimer that broadly limits Cisco's liability while specifically preserving certain rights related to title and non-infringement. It illustrates how a warranty disclaimer can be structured to exclude many warranties while still maintaining protections for ownership and infringement claims.",5

This establishes a broad disclaimer of warranties, which is a common practice in contracts to limit liability.

2. **Specific Exclusions**: The clause explicitly mentions that each party disclaims any other warranties, including those related to quality, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

4. **Implication for Title and Non-Infringement**: By not explicitly waiving title and non-infringement warranties, the clause leaves open the possibility that these warranties may still be implied or assumed under applicable law, unless otherwise stated in the contract.

1. **Exclusive Remedy**: The clause explicitly states that if the product is defective or nonconforming, the seller is obligated to either replace the product at no additional charge or refund the purchase price upon the return of the product. Importantly, it specifies that this replacement or refund constitutes the ""sole and exclusive remedy"" for the buyer. This means that the buyer cannot seek any other forms of remedy (such as repair or additional compensation) beyond what is outlined in this clause.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause also limits the seller's liability to the purchase price of the product in question. This reinforces the exclusivity of the remedy, as it caps the seller's financial responsibility and prevents the buyer from claiming damages beyond the purchase price.

3. **Claims Process**: The clause outlines a specific process for the buyer to follow in the event of a claim regarding damage, defect, or shortage. The buyer must inspect the product upon receipt and notify the seller within a specified timeframe (10 days for damage/defect and 150 days for other claims). This process is crucial for the buyer to be eligible for the exclusive remedy of replacement or refund.

4. **Waiver of Claims**: The clause includes a waiver of claims if the buyer does not follow the specified notice requirements. This means that if the buyer fails to notify the seller within the designated timeframes, they forfeit their right to any remedy, including the exclusive remedy of replacement or refund.

5. **Exclusion of Other Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the seller is not liable for special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages. This further emphasizes that the only recourse available to the buyer is the replacement or refund, as outlined in the clause.

3. **Types of Losses Excluded**: The clause further clarifies that neither party will be liable for various types of damages, including special, incidental, punitive, consequential, indirect, or exemplary damages. This reinforces the idea that the Buyer cannot claim losses beyond the direct cost of the product itself, which may include lost profits or business opportunities.

In the context of buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses, this clause is relevant because it highlights the typical language that buyers would want to avoid. Here’s how it relates to your query:

1. **Limitation of Warranties**: The clause states that the only warranties are those explicitly mentioned in the agreement, which can leave the buyer without recourse if the product or service does not meet their expectations or needs.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: By disclaiming all implied warranties, including those of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, the clause significantly reduces the buyer's protections. Buyers often rely on these implied warranties to ensure that the goods or services are suitable for their intended use.

3. **Non-Infringement Disclaimer**: The clause also disclaims any warranties of non-infringement that are not expressly stated, which can be particularly concerning for buyers who want assurance that the products or services they are purchasing do not infringe on third-party rights.

In summary, this clause serves as an example of a warranty disclaimer that is not favorable to buyers, as it limits their rights and protections. Buyers typically seek to negotiate more favorable terms that include broader warranties and fewer disclaimers to ensure they are adequately protected in their transactions.",5

It states that neither party makes any representations or warranties regarding the agreement or the transactions contemplated, effectively limiting the liability of the parties involved. Here’s how it relates to the query for buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses:

1. **Broad Disclaimer**: The clause broadly disclaims all representations and warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This is typically unfavorable for buyers, as it means they cannot rely on any assurances about the quality or suitability of the goods or services being provided.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause specifically states that each party waives any claims regarding potential sales revenues or economic benefits from the agreement. This can be detrimental to a buyer who may expect certain outcomes or benefits from the transaction.

3. **Lack of Recourse**: By waiving all implied warranties and limiting the scope of any claims, the clause reduces the buyer's recourse in case the product or service does not meet their expectations or needs.

In contrast, a buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clause would typically include specific warranties or representations that protect the buyer's interests, such as guarantees of quality, performance, or suitability for a particular purpose. It might also limit the scope of disclaimers to only certain aspects, allowing buyers to retain some level of assurance regarding the transaction. 

In summary, the provided clause is relevant to the query as it exemplifies a warranty disclaimer that is not favorable to buyers, highlighting the need for clauses that better protect buyer interests in contractual agreements.",5

It states that neither party makes any representations or warranties regarding the subject matter of the agreement, which includes disclaiming implied warranties such as merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This means that the buyer cannot hold the seller accountable for any defects or issues with the product or service that may arise after the sale, unless those issues are explicitly covered in the agreement.

In the context of your query for buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses, this clause is relevant because it exemplifies a typical seller-favorable approach. Buyers typically seek warranties that protect their interests, ensuring that the products or services they purchase meet certain standards and are free from defects. A buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clause would instead limit the scope of the disclaimer, affirmatively state certain warranties, or provide specific remedies for breaches of those warranties.

To make the clause more buyer-favorable, it could be revised to include explicit warranties regarding the quality and performance of the goods or services, or to limit the scope of the disclaimer to only certain aspects, thereby providing the buyer with more protection and recourse in case of issues.",4
buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses,cad9ed40ac,"DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR EXTENDS ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.","The clause you provided is a warranty disclaimer, which is relevant to the query about buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses in several ways:

1. **General Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause states that neither party makes any representations or warranties except as expressly set forth in the agreement. This is a broad disclaimer that limits the liability of the seller (or provider) by stating that they are not responsible for any implied warranties, which can be unfavorable to the buyer.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause specifically mentions the exclusion of implied warranties such as merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This is significant because it means that the buyer cannot rely on any assumptions about the quality or suitability of the product or service unless those are explicitly stated in the agreement. This can be particularly disadvantageous for buyers who may expect certain standards or qualities.

3. **Buyer-Favorable Considerations**: For a clause to be considered buyer-favorable, it would typically include explicit warranties or representations that protect the buyer's interests. In contrast, the provided clause does not offer any such protections and instead limits the seller's obligations. A buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clause would ideally include specific warranties that the seller is willing to stand behind, thereby providing the buyer with assurances regarding the product or service.

4. **Negotiation Leverage**: Buyers may want to negotiate the terms of such disclaimers to ensure that they receive certain guarantees about the product or service. A buyer-favorable clause might include language that allows for certain warranties to remain intact, or it might limit the scope of the disclaimer to specific areas, thereby providing the buyer with more security.

In summary, the clause you provided is a standard warranty disclaimer that is generally more favorable to the seller than the buyer. For a buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clause, one would expect to see explicit warranties included that protect the buyer's interests and limit the seller's ability to disclaim responsibility for the quality or performance of the goods or services provided.",4

Here’s how it relates to the query for buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause states that the reseller (the buyer) shall make no representations, guarantees, or warranties concerning the company product except as expressly authorized by the company. This places a significant limitation on the reseller's ability to provide assurances to its customers, which can be detrimental to the reseller's business and customer relationships.

2. **Indemnification**: The clause includes indemnification provisions that require the company to indemnify the reseller for losses suffered due to the company products, but it also requires the reseller to indemnify the company for losses related to the reseller's activities. This creates a potential imbalance where the reseller may be held liable for issues arising from the company's products, while the company has limited liability for its own products.

3. **Lack of Buyer Protections**: A buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clause would typically include stronger protections for the buyer, such as warranties regarding the quality and performance of the products, or limitations on the buyer's liability. In contrast, this clause does not provide any such protections for the reseller, making it less favorable for them.

In summary, the clause is relevant to the query because it exemplifies a warranty disclaimer that is not favorable to the buyer (reseller) due to its limitations on representations and the indemnification obligations it imposes.

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **Definition of Indemnity**: The clause explicitly states that the Corporation agrees to protect and indemnify the Indemnified Parties from various liabilities, including expenses, losses, claims, and damages that arise from their professional services. This aligns with the general purpose of an indemnity clause, which is to allocate risk and provide protection against potential legal claims.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause details the specific circumstances under which indemnification applies, such as misrepresentations, omissions, regulatory inquiries, and breaches of representations or warranties. This specificity is important in indemnity clauses, as it clarifies the extent of the protection offered.

3. **Exclusions from Indemnification**: The clause also includes limitations on indemnification, stating that it does not apply if a court finds that the Indemnified Parties were negligent or engaged in fraudulent or illegal acts. This is a common feature in indemnity clauses to prevent abuse of the indemnification provision.

4. **Notification and Defense Rights**: The clause outlines the process for notifying the Corporation of claims and the rights of the Indemnified Parties to retain separate legal counsel under certain conditions. This procedural aspect is crucial in indemnity clauses, as it ensures that both parties understand their rights and responsibilities in the event of a claim.

5. **Trust for Non-Party Indemnified Parties**: The clause mentions that the Agents will hold the rights and benefits of the indemnity in trust for any Indemnified Party who is not a party to the agreement. This expands the protection to third parties, which is often a consideration in indemnity clauses.

6. **Consent for Settlements**: The requirement for prior written consent before settling claims ensures that the interests of the Indemnified Parties are protected, which is a standard practice in indemnity agreements.

In summary, this clause is a comprehensive indemnity provision that outlines the obligations of the Corporation to indemnify the Agents and their affiliates, detailing the scope, limitations, and procedural requirements associated with such indemnification.

This clause specifies the circumstances under which indemnification will occur.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause outlines specific scenarios in which the Indemnitor is obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee. These include:

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Indemnified Party from claims, damages, and liabilities arising from the negligent acts or omissions of the Indemnifying Party, its subcontractors, agents, or employees. This establishes a clear obligation for each party to protect the other from certain risks.

3. **Exclusions**: The clause also includes an important limitation: the Indemnifying Party is not liable for claims caused by the sole negligence of the Indemnified Party. This is a common feature in mutual indemnification clauses, as it prevents one party from being held responsible for the other party's own negligence.

4. **Notification and Defense Rights**: The clause outlines the process for notifying the Indemnifying Party of a claim and the rights of both parties to participate in the defense. This ensures that both parties are involved in managing claims and that the Indemnifying Party has the opportunity to defend itself.

5. **Successors and Assigns**: The clause states that the rights and obligations under this provision will bind and benefit successors, assigns, and heirs, which is important for ensuring that the indemnification obligations continue even if the parties change.

Overall, this clause exemplifies the principles of mutual indemnification by establishing reciprocal obligations to indemnify and defend against claims, while also providing clear procedures for notification and defense. This is crucial for managing risk and liability in contractual relationships.",5
mutual indemnification provisions,eb53e37b8b,"25. Indemnification. The Parties shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other, their heirs, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, expenses, causes of action, suits, claims, and judgments of any kind or character for injury to person or property arising in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT, whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise.","The clause you provided is a mutual indemnification provision, which is relevant to your query as it outlines the responsibilities of the parties involved in the agreement regarding indemnification.

Here's how the clause relates to mutual indemnification:

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause establishes that both parties (referred to as ""the Parties"") have an obligation to indemnify each other. This means that if one party incurs losses or liabilities due to the actions or responsibilities of the other party, the responsible party must compensate the affected party.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the indemnification covers a wide range of potential issues, including losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, and claims related to injury to person or property. This broad scope ensures that both parties are protected against various risks that may arise from their contractual relationship.

3. **Defense Against Claims**: The provision also includes a duty to ""defend"" each other against claims. This means that if a third party brings a claim against one party related to the agreement, the other party is obligated to provide legal defense and cover associated costs.

4. **Negligence Consideration**: The clause explicitly states that indemnification applies ""whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise."" This means that even if the indemnifying party is found to be negligent, they are still responsible for indemnifying the other party, which is a key aspect of mutual indemnification.

5. **Heirs, Successors, and Assigns**: The inclusion of ""heirs, successors, and assigns"" indicates that the indemnification obligations extend beyond the parties themselves, ensuring that future parties involved in the agreement are also protected.

In summary, this clause is a clear example of mutual indemnification, as it establishes reciprocal obligations for both parties to protect each other from various liabilities and claims that may arise in connection with the agreement.",5

Here's how the clause relates to mutual indemnification:

1. **Indemnifying Party**: The clause defines the ""Indemnifying Party"" as the party responsible for indemnifying the other party (the ""Indemnified Party"") in case of losses. This establishes a reciprocal obligation where both parties can potentially be indemnified depending on the circumstances.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the indemnification applies to ""all Losses"" incurred by the Indemnified Parties due to the Indemnifying Party's material breach of the agreement. This means that if one party fails to fulfill its contractual obligations, it must compensate the other party for the resulting losses.

3. **Exclusions**: The clause includes a limitation that the indemnification does not apply if the losses are primarily caused by the Indemnified Party itself. This creates a balance, ensuring that a party is not held liable for losses that are primarily due to the other party's actions or negligence.

4. **Affiliates and Representatives**: The indemnification extends to the Indemnified Parties' affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives. This broadens the protection offered, ensuring that not only the parties to the agreement but also their associated individuals and entities are covered.

In summary, this clause is a key component of mutual indemnification provisions, as it establishes the framework for how each party will protect the other from losses resulting from breaches of the agreement, while also setting clear boundaries on liability.",5

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The indemnification covers ""all losses, liabilities, damages and expenses,"" which includes reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. This broad scope ensures that any financial repercussions arising from third-party claims related to breaches of the agreement are addressed.

3. **Breach of Representations and Warranties**: The clause specifically mentions that indemnification applies to claims resulting from breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants. This is a common aspect of mutual indemnification provisions, as it holds parties accountable for their commitments under the contract.

4. **Protection for Related Parties**: The clause extends indemnification to include not just the parties themselves but also their directors, officers, employees, and agents. This further emphasizes the protective nature of the provision, ensuring that individuals associated with the parties are also safeguarded against liabilities.

This means that if any losses or damages arise due to the Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of the agreement, the Provider is responsible for covering those costs.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause details the types of losses that are covered, including legal fees, penalties, and any costs associated with enforcing indemnification rights. This broad scope ensures that the Indemnified Party is protected against a wide range of potential claims.

3. **Third-Party Claims**: The indemnification is specifically related to claims made by third parties against the Recipient, which is a common scenario in contractual relationships. This highlights the importance of protecting the Recipient from external claims that may arise due to the actions of the Provider.

4. **Consent for Settlements**: The clause also stipulates that the Provider cannot settle any claims without the prior written consent of the Recipient or Indemnified Party. This provision ensures that the Recipient has a say in how claims are handled, which is a critical aspect of mutual indemnification.

5. **Mutuality**: While the clause as written primarily focuses on the Provider's obligations, mutual indemnification typically involves reciprocal obligations where both parties agree to indemnify each other under similar circumstances.

(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;

Here’s how it relates to the concept of unilateral indemnification:

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause specifies that one party agrees to indemnify the other for losses arising from third-party claims related to personal injury or property damage. This is a key characteristic of unilateral indemnification, where only one party (the indemnifying party) bears the responsibility for indemnification.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The indemnification is triggered by the indemnifying party's breach of duty, representation, or obligation under the agreement, or by its negligence or willful misconduct. This establishes a clear basis for when indemnification is applicable, which is a common feature in unilateral indemnification clauses.

3. **Claims Procedure**: The clause outlines a detailed procedure for how claims should be handled, including the requirement for the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of any claims and the process for defense and settlement. This procedural aspect is important in unilateral indemnification clauses to ensure that the indemnifying party has the opportunity to manage the defense of claims.

4. **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party has the right to control the defense of any claims, which is a typical provision in unilateral indemnification clauses. This allows the indemnifying party to manage the legal strategy and costs associated with defending against claims.

5. **Limitations on Settlement**: The clause includes provisions regarding settlements, requiring the indemnifying party to obtain consent from the indemnified party before settling claims, which protects the interests of the indemnified party.

6. **Reservation of Rights**: If the indemnifying party does not elect to defend or contests its obligation to indemnify, the indemnified party can take action to defend itself while reserving the right to seek indemnification later. This ensures that the indemnified party is not left without recourse if the indemnifying party fails to fulfill its obligations.

In a unilateral indemnification clause, only one party agrees to indemnify the other party, meaning that one party assumes the responsibility for certain losses or damages without requiring the other party to do the same.

In the clause you shared, both parties agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other. This means that if one party incurs losses or liabilities due to the actions or responsibilities outlined in the agreement, the other party is also responsible for indemnifying them. This mutual approach provides a balanced allocation of risk between the parties.

In contrast, a unilateral indemnification clause would typically look something like this:

In contrast, the clause you provided outlines a mutual obligation where both parties have indemnification responsibilities.

In the context of your query, the relevance of the provided clause lies in its structure and the principles of indemnification it embodies. Here are some key points:

1. **Indemnification Definition**: The clause defines the responsibilities of the Indemnifying Party to protect the Indemnified Parties from losses arising from breaches or misconduct.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: It specifies the circumstances under which indemnification applies, such as breaches of the agreement or gross negligence.

3. **Mutuality**: Since the clause is mutual, it contrasts with a unilateral clause, which would only impose obligations on one party. This is important for understanding the balance of risk and responsibility in contractual relationships.

4. **Legal Protection**: Indemnification clauses are designed to allocate risk and provide legal protection to parties in a contract. Understanding the difference between unilateral and mutual clauses is crucial for parties negotiating contracts to ensure they are adequately protected.

This is relevant to your query about a unilateral indemnification clause because it illustrates a mutual indemnification arrangement rather than a unilateral one.

### Key Points of the Clause:

1. **Mutual Indemnification**: 
   - **Section 6.1** specifies that the Owner indemnifies the Operator and its affiliates against certain losses arising from third-party claims related to the Owner's actions or breaches.
   - **Section 6.2** specifies that the Operator indemnifies the Owner and its affiliates under similar circumstances.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**:
   - Both sections define the scope of indemnification, which includes losses arising from breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants, as well as negligent or intentional acts by the indemnifying party or its agents.

3. **Exclusions**:
   - Each section includes exclusions where the indemnifying party is not responsible for indemnifying the other party for losses resulting from the other party's negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.

### Relevance to Unilateral Indemnification:

- **Unilateral Indemnification**: A unilateral indemnification clause would typically involve one party agreeing to indemnify the other without a reciprocal obligation. In contrast, the provided clause establishes a mutual obligation where both parties agree to indemnify each other under specified circumstances.

- **Implications**: If you were looking for a unilateral indemnification clause, this example would not meet that criterion, as it requires both parties to take on indemnification responsibilities. A unilateral clause would only have one party (either the Owner or the Operator) bearing the indemnification responsibility without a corresponding obligation from the other party.

In summary, while the clause demonstrates the concept of indemnification, it does not represent a unilateral indemnification clause, as it imposes mutual obligations on both parties.",5

Here's how it is relevant to the query regarding indemnification of third-party claims:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause specifies that both parties (VS and PPD) have a duty to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party against any damages, costs, expenses, and liabilities arising from third-party claims. This means that if a third party brings a claim against one of the parties due to the negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement by the other party, the responsible party must cover the costs associated with that claim.

2. **Definition of Third Party Claim**: The clause explicitly defines a ""Third Party Claim"" as any claim, action, or proceeding initiated by someone who is not a party to the agreement. This is crucial because it clarifies the scope of indemnification, focusing on claims that arise from external parties rather than internal disputes.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause requires the indemnified party to provide prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any third-party claim for which indemnification is sought. This is important for ensuring that the indemnifying party has the opportunity to respond and manage the claim effectively.

4. **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party has the right to control the defense and settlement of the third-party claim, which allows them to manage the legal strategy and costs associated with the claim. However, they must act reasonably and in good faith, which protects the interests of the indemnified party.

5. **Cooperation and Participation**: The indemnified party is required to cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense and settlement of the claim. They also have the right to participate in the defense, although they cannot control it unless certain conditions are met (e.g., if the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense).

6. **Legal Counsel**: The clause allows the indemnified party to employ separate legal counsel at their own expense unless certain conditions are met, which provides flexibility for the indemnified party to protect their interests.

In summary, this clause is directly relevant to the query about indemnification of third-party claims as it establishes the framework for how the parties will handle such claims, including their respective responsibilities, rights, and procedures for defense and indemnification.",5

This is directly relevant to your query about indemnification of third-party claims for several reasons:

1. **Definition of Claim**: The clause begins by defining what constitutes a ""Claim,"" which includes any action or proceeding initiated by a third party, excluding affiliates of either party. This sets the foundation for understanding the scope of indemnification.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: Section 7.2 explicitly states that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for defending and indemnifying the Indemnified Party against any claims arising from specific circumstances, such as:
   - The operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's site.
   - The marketing or sale of products or services through that site.
   - Breaches of representations or warranties made by the Indemnifying Party.
   - Infringement of intellectual property rights related to materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.

3. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause outlines the types of costs and damages that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for, including claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, and reasonable attorneys' fees.

4. **Limitations on Liability**: Section 8.2 addresses limitations on liability, clarifying that neither party will be liable for consequential damages, except in cases where a third party has been awarded damages against a party that is entitled to indemnification. This reinforces the importance of the indemnification clause, as it provides a pathway for the Indemnified Party to recover damages awarded to third parties.

In summary, this clause is crucial for understanding how the parties will handle third-party claims, the responsibilities of each party in such situations, and the extent of protection afforded to the Indemnified Party. It establishes a framework for risk management and liability allocation in the context of third-party claims, which is essential for both parties to understand their rights and obligations under the agreement.",5

Here’s how it is relevant to your query about indemnification of third-party claims:

1. **Definition of Claim**: The clause begins by defining what constitutes a ""Claim,"" which includes any action or proceeding initiated by a third party (excluding affiliates of either party). This is crucial because indemnification typically pertains to claims made by external parties, and this definition sets the scope for what is covered under the indemnification provisions.

2. **Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party**: The clause identifies the roles of the parties involved. The ""Indemnifying Party"" is responsible for defending and indemnifying the ""Indemnified Party"" against claims. This establishes a clear responsibility for one party to protect the other from certain liabilities arising from third-party actions.

3. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies the circumstances under which the Indemnifying Party must indemnify the Indemnified Party. This includes claims arising from:
   - The operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's site.
   - The marketing or sale of products or services through that site.
   - Breaches of representations or warranties made by the Indemnifying Party.
   - Infringement of intellectual property rights related to materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.

   This detailed scope is essential for understanding the extent of the indemnification obligation and the types of claims that trigger this obligation.

4. **Costs and Expenses**: The clause explicitly states that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for covering all costs, losses, damages, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of the claims. This financial protection is a key aspect of indemnification, ensuring that the Indemnified Party is not left bearing the financial burden of defending against third-party claims.

5. **Procedure for Indemnification**: The clause references a subsequent section (Section 7.3) that likely outlines the procedures to be followed when a claim arises. This procedural aspect is important for ensuring that both parties understand how to handle claims and the indemnification process.

In summary, this clause is directly relevant to the indemnification of third-party claims as it establishes the framework for how one party will defend and compensate the other in the event of claims made by external parties, detailing the responsibilities, scope, and financial implications of such indemnification.",5

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the indemnification covers ""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses,"" which includes legal costs and attorneys' fees. This broad language ensures that the indemnified party is protected from a wide range of potential liabilities that could arise from third-party claims.

3. **Connection to Warranties and Representations**: The indemnification is specifically tied to claims that are inconsistent with the warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements made by the indemnifying party in the agreement. This means that if a third-party claim arises due to a breach of these representations or warranties, the indemnifying party is obligated to indemnify the other party.

4. **Right to Withhold Payment**: The clause also provides the non-indemnifying party the right to withhold payment pending the resolution of any claims. This serves as a protective measure, allowing the non-indemnifying party to mitigate potential losses while the claim is being addressed.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to third-party claims as it outlines the responsibilities of each party to protect the other from liabilities arising from such claims, ensuring that the indemnified party does not suffer financial loss due to the actions or failures of the indemnifying party.",5

1. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**: 
   - Section 11.6 explicitly states that neither party will be liable for consequential damages, except in certain circumstances. One of those exceptions includes damages arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if either party engages in fraudulent behavior or acts with gross negligence, they cannot rely on this limitation to avoid liability for consequential damages.

2. **Liability Limitations**:
   - Section 11.7 outlines the limitations on liability for claims arising out of the agreement. Similar to Section 11.6, it specifies that the limitation on liability does not apply to claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This reinforces the idea that parties cannot limit their liability for serious misconduct, ensuring that they remain accountable for such actions.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**:
   - Sections 12.1 and 12.2 detail the indemnification obligations of each party. Both sections include provisions that address claims arising from negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct by the respective indemnifying party or its affiliates.

4. **Scope of Indemnification**:
   - The indemnification clauses (Sections 12.1 and 12.2) provide a framework for how each party will protect the other from losses resulting from breaches of the agreement or misconduct.

### Key Points of Relevance:

1. **Exclusion of Liability for Fraud and Gross Negligence**:
   - **Section 11.6** explicitly states that neither party will be liable for consequential damages, except in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if either party engages in fraudulent behavior or acts with gross negligence, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages that arise from such actions.

2. **Liability Limitations**:
   - **Section 11.7** outlines that a party's aggregate liability is limited, but this limitation does not apply to claims arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This reinforces the idea that parties cannot limit their liability for serious misconduct, ensuring that victims of such actions can seek full compensation for their losses.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**:
   - **Sections 12.1 and 12.2** detail the indemnification responsibilities of each party. Both parties agree to indemnify the other for claims arising from their own fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if one party's actions in these areas lead to a claim from a third party, they are obligated to defend and hold the other party harmless from those claims.

4. **Scope of Indemnification**:
   - The indemnification clauses specify that losses resulting from fraud or gross negligence are included in the indemnification obligations. This ensures that if either party's misconduct leads to legal claims or damages, they are responsible for covering those losses, including legal fees.

### Conclusion:
The clauses you provided create a framework that holds parties accountable for fraud and gross negligence, ensuring that they cannot escape liability through limitations on damages or liability caps. This is crucial for protecting the interests of both parties in the agreement, as it provides a clear path for recourse in the event of serious misconduct.

Here’s how it relates to your query about fraud and/or gross negligence indemnity:

1. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**: 
   - Clause 11.6 specifies that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, such as lost profits or indirect damages, arising from the agreement. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for certain situations, including fraud and gross negligence. This means that if one party commits fraud or acts with gross negligence, they cannot rely on this limitation to avoid liability for consequential damages resulting from those actions.

2. **Liability Limitations**:
   - Clause 11.7 establishes a cap on the aggregate liability of each party under the agreement. However, it also includes exceptions for specific scenarios, including fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct. This indicates that if a party engages in fraudulent behavior or grossly negligent conduct, they are not protected by the liability cap, and they may be held fully accountable for damages arising from such actions.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**:
   - Both clauses reference indemnification obligations under Article 12. This suggests that if a party's actions (including fraud or gross negligence) lead to a claim against the other party, the responsible party may be required to indemnify the other party for losses incurred as a result of those actions. This reinforces the idea that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct through indemnification clauses.

Here's a breakdown of how the clause relates to your query:

1. **Exclusions from Liability**: The clause states that, with certain exceptions, neither party nor its affiliates will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages. This is a common limitation of liability clause that seeks to protect parties from extensive damages that could arise from various claims.

2. **Exceptions for Serious Misconduct**: The clause specifically carves out exceptions for:
   - **Fraud**: This indicates that if one party commits fraud, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages resulting from that fraud.
   - **Willful Misconduct**: Similar to fraud, if a party engages in willful misconduct, they are also not protected by the limitation of liability.
   - **Gross Negligence**: This term refers to a severe degree of negligence that demonstrates a reckless disregard for the safety or reasonable treatment of others. The clause states that if gross negligence occurs, the party responsible cannot limit their liability for damages.

3. **Indemnification Context**: The clause also mentions that damages required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification are not subject to the limitation of liability. This means that if a party is required to indemnify another party for losses arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they cannot limit their liability in those situations.

In summary, this clause is crucial because it establishes that while parties may limit their liability for certain types of damages, they cannot do so in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.5, addresses the limitation of liability between the parties involved in the contract. It is particularly relevant to your query about fraud and/or gross negligence indemnity for the following reasons:

1. **Exclusions from Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that there are exceptions to the limitation of liability. Specifically, it notes that if there is fraud by a party, or if a party breaches its obligations under specified articles (in this case, Article 7 on Intellectual Property and Article 10 on Confidentiality), the limitation of liability does not apply. This means that if a party commits fraud or breaches these obligations, they can be held liable for damages without the limitations that would otherwise apply.

2. **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**: The clause also mentions that if damages are required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification, the limitation of liability does not apply. This indicates that if one party is required to indemnify the other for claims made by third parties, they can be held liable for those damages, regardless of the limitations set forth in the clause.

3. **Scope of Liability**: The clause outlines the types of damages that are excluded from liability, such as indirect, incidental, consequential, and speculative damages. This is important in the context of gross negligence, as it suggests that the parties are trying to limit their exposure to certain types of damages unless the exceptions (like fraud or specific breaches) apply.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it delineates the circumstances under which a party can be held liable for fraud and potentially gross negligence, as well as the conditions under which indemnification applies. It establishes a framework for understanding liability and indemnity in the context of serious breaches of conduct, such as fraud.",5

Under no circumstance shall either party hereto settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any claim, suit, proceeding, or action that is the subject of indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably.","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations between two parties, specifically focusing on third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement claims. Here's how it relates to your query about third-party IP infringement indemnity:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause establishes that both parties (NCM and Network Affiliate) have specific responsibilities to indemnify each other against losses and costs arising from third-party claims. This is particularly relevant in the context of IP infringement, as it addresses who is responsible for defending against such claims and covering associated costs.

2. **Section 10.1 (Network Affiliate Indemnification)**: This section specifies that the Network Affiliate must indemnify NCM for any claims related to breaches of the agreement, including claims of infringement arising from materials supplied by the Network Affiliate. This means that if a third party claims that the content provided by the Network Affiliate infringes their IP rights, the Network Affiliate is responsible for defending against that claim and covering any costs incurred.

3. **Section 10.3 (NCM Infringement Indemnification)**: This section specifically addresses NCM's obligations to indemnify the Network Affiliate for claims arising from the infringement of third-party IP rights due to the use of NCM Property. If a third party claims that the NCM Property infringes their IP rights, NCM is responsible for defending against that claim and covering the associated costs, provided that the Network Affiliate is using the NCM Property in accordance with the agreement.

4. **Limitations of Obligations (Section 10.3(c))**: This section outlines the limitations on NCM's indemnification obligations, clarifying scenarios where NCM would not be liable for infringement claims. This is important for understanding the scope of indemnity and the conditions under which each party is protected.

5. **Control of Defense (Section 10.4)**: This section grants the indemnifying party (Indemnitor) the right to control the defense of any claims, while also allowing the indemnified party (Indemnitee) to participate. This is crucial in managing how third-party claims are handled and ensuring that both parties are involved in the process.

Overall, the clause provides a comprehensive framework for addressing third-party IP infringement claims, detailing the responsibilities of each party, the scope of indemnification, and the procedures for handling such claims. This is essential for mitigating risks associated with IP infringement in the context of the agreement.",5
third party IP infringement indemnity,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided addresses liability in the context of intellectual property (IP) rights, specifically concerning third-party claims. Here's how it relates to your query about third-party IP infringement indemnity:

1. **Exclusion of Liability**: The clause states that, except for claims related to third-party IP infringement, neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. This means that if a third party claims that one of the parties has infringed on their intellectual property rights, the liability for that claim is not limited by this clause. In other words, the parties acknowledge that IP infringement claims can lead to significant damages, and they are not shielding themselves from such liabilities.

2. **Indemnity Implication**: While the clause does not explicitly mention indemnity, it implies that if a party is found liable for infringing on a third party's IP rights, they may be responsible for compensating the other party for any damages or losses incurred as a result of that infringement. This is a common aspect of indemnity clauses, where one party agrees to protect the other from certain claims or liabilities.

3. **Risk Allocation**: The clause effectively allocates the risk associated with third-party IP infringement. By excluding these claims from the limitation of liability, the parties are recognizing that such claims can have serious consequences and that they need to address them separately, potentially through an indemnity provision elsewhere in the contract.

In summary, this clause is relevant to third-party IP infringement indemnity as it establishes that claims related to IP infringement are treated differently from other types of claims, and it signals that the parties may need to consider additional provisions to address indemnification for such claims.",4

1. **Indemnity by the Company (Clause 4.01)**: This section outlines the Company's obligation to indemnify the Distributor against claims of patent, copyright, or proprietary right infringement related to the Products it supplies. If a third party alleges that a Product infringes on their IP rights, the Company is responsible for defending the Distributor and its customers against such claims, provided that the Distributor promptly notifies the Company and assists in the defense. This is a clear example of third-party IP infringement indemnity, as it protects the Distributor from legal consequences arising from third-party claims.

2. **Indemnity by the Distributor (Clause 4.02)**: Conversely, this section requires the Distributor to indemnify the Company against claims arising from the Distributor's use of the Company's trademark (Snotarator™). If the Distributor's actions lead to claims of infringement or other legal issues, the Distributor must hold the Company harmless. This creates a reciprocal indemnity structure where both parties have obligations to protect each other from third-party claims related to IP infringement.

3. **General Indemnity Clause (Clause 9.03)**: This clause provides a broader indemnity framework, where the Distributor agrees to indemnify the Company for claims arising from the Distributor's actions or third-party actions related to the Products.

In summary, the clauses collectively establish a framework for indemnity concerning third-party IP infringement, with the Company taking responsibility for claims related to the Products it supplies, while the Distributor is responsible for claims arising from its use of the Company's trademarks.

Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The indemnification clause you provided is directly relevant to the query regarding the indemnification of third-party claims based on a breach of the agreement. Here’s how it applies:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause establishes mutual indemnification obligations between the parties (VS and PPD). Each party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party and its affiliates, directors, officers, and employees from any damages, costs, expenses, and liabilities arising from third-party claims. This is crucial in the context of breaches of the agreement, as it specifies that if a third party brings a claim due to the negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement by one party, that party is responsible for indemnifying the other.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause explicitly states that indemnification applies to ""any claim, action or proceeding by a third party"" that arises from the actions or failures of the indemnifying party. This means that if a third party alleges damages due to a breach of the agreement by either VS or PPD, the responsible party must cover the costs associated with that claim.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause requires the indemnified party to provide prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any third-party claim. This is important for ensuring that the indemnifying party can respond appropriately and manage the defense of the claim.

4. **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party has the right to control the defense and settlement of the third-party claim, which allows them to manage the legal strategy and any potential settlements. However, they must act reasonably and in good faith, which protects the interests of the indemnified party.

5. **Participation Rights**: The indemnified party retains the right to participate in the defense of the claim, although they cannot control it unless certain conditions are met (e.g., if the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense). This ensures that the indemnified party can protect its interests while still allowing the indemnifying party to manage the defense.

Overall, this clause provides a clear framework for how the parties will handle third-party claims that arise from breaches of the agreement, ensuring that each party is protected from the financial consequences of the other's actions.",5
indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,6a700c0c62,"EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","The clause you provided addresses the limitations of liability between the parties in the context of breaches of the agreement, specifically in relation to consequential and other types of damages. However, it also makes a specific exception for indemnification obligations related to third-party claims, which is directly relevant to your query about indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement.

Here's how the clause is relevant:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that it does not limit the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 9 concerning claims made by third parties. This means that if one party breaches the agreement and a third party makes a claim as a result of that breach, the indemnification obligations outlined in Section 9 will still apply.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause limits the liability of each party for certain types of damages (consequential, indirect, etc.) arising from breaches of the agreement. However, this limitation does not extend to indemnification for third-party claims. This distinction is crucial because it indicates that while parties may not be liable for certain damages to each other, they can still be held responsible for indemnifying third parties affected by their actions.

3. **Scope of Claims**: The clause emphasizes that the limitation of liability applies to claims between the parties themselves, not to claims made by third parties. This means that if a third party suffers damages due to a breach of the agreement, the party responsible for the breach may still be required to indemnify the other party for those third-party claims, regardless of the limitations on direct damages between the parties.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it clarifies that while there are limitations on liability for direct damages between the parties, these limitations do not apply to indemnification obligations related to third-party claims arising from breaches of the agreement.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes that, except for specific circumstances, neither party will be liable for lost profits or any special, indirect, or consequential damages. This is important in the context of indemnification because it clarifies the extent of liability each party has in relation to third-party claims. 

2. **Indemnification Provisions**: The clause explicitly mentions that amounts payable to third parties in connection with claims subject to the indemnification provisions of Section 9.1 (Payment) are exceptions to the limitation of liability. This means that if a party is required to indemnify a third party due to a breach of the agreement, they may be liable for those amounts, despite the general limitation on liability for other types of damages.

3. **Breach of Confidentiality**: The clause also highlights that breaches of obligations under Section 5 (Confidentiality) are another exception to the limitation of liability. If a breach of confidentiality leads to a third-party claim, the indemnifying party may be responsible for those claims, reinforcing the importance of confidentiality obligations in the agreement.

4. **Scope of Indemnification**: By specifying that indemnification applies to claims related to breaches of the agreement, the clause delineates the scope of indemnification. It indicates that if a party's actions (or inactions) lead to a third-party claim, they may be required to indemnify the other party for those claims, provided they fall under the specified sections.

In summary, this clause outlines the limitations on liability while also clarifying the circumstances under which indemnification for third-party claims is applicable, particularly in relation to breaches of the agreement and confidentiality obligations.

Here’s how it is relevant to your query about indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement:

1. **Definition of Claim**: The clause begins by defining what constitutes a ""Claim,"" which includes any action or proceeding initiated by a third party. This is crucial because it sets the scope of what types of claims the indemnification provisions will cover.

2. **Indemnity Obligations**: Section 7.2 explicitly states that each party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") is responsible for defending, indemnifying, and holding harmless the other party (the ""Indemnified Party"") from any claims arising out of specific circumstances. This includes claims based on:
   - The operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's site.
   - The offer, marketing, or sale of products or services through that site.
   - Breaches of representations or warranties made by the Indemnifying Party.
   - Infringement of intellectual property rights by materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.

3. **Scope of Indemnification**: The indemnification extends to all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees. This means that if a third party brings a claim against the Indemnified Party due to the actions or omissions of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party is responsible for covering those costs.

4. **Limitations on Liability**: Section 8.2 clarifies that, except for certain circumstances (like third-party judgments for which indemnification is provided), neither party will be liable for consequential damages. This reinforces the idea that the indemnification is a primary remedy for third-party claims, as it allows the Indemnified Party to recover from the Indemnifying Party rather than seeking damages directly from the other party.

5. **Breach of Agreement**: The clause implies that if a third-party claim arises due to a breach of the agreement by the Indemnifying Party (for example, a breach of representations or warranties), the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party. This directly addresses your query about indemnification related to breaches of the agreement.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it establishes the framework for how one party will indemnify the other for third-party claims that arise from breaches of the agreement, ensuring that the Indemnified Party is protected from financial loss due to the actions of the Indemnifying Party.",5

While it does not directly mention indemnification of third-party claims, it is relevant to your query in several ways:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that it does not limit a Party's indemnification obligations. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for third-party claims arising from a breach of the agreement, this indemnification obligation remains intact and is not affected by the limitation of liability outlined in the clause.

2. **Third-Party Claims**: The clause mentions that damages awarded to a third party under a third-party claim are not subject to the limitations of liability. This implies that if a third party successfully claims damages due to a breach of the agreement, the party responsible for the breach may still be liable for those damages, regardless of the limitations set forth in this clause.

3. **Breach of Agreement**: Although the clause primarily focuses on limitations of liability, it indirectly relates to breaches of the agreement. If a party breaches the agreement and that breach leads to a third-party claim, the indemnification obligations would come into play, allowing the non-breaching party to seek compensation for any damages awarded to the third party.

In summary, while Section 13.4 does not explicitly detail the indemnification process for third-party claims, it establishes that indemnification obligations are not limited by the liability restrictions in the clause. This means that if a breach of the agreement leads to a third-party claim, the indemnifying party may still be responsible for covering the damages awarded to that third party.",4

This directly addresses the concern of trademark infringement.

3. **Scope of Indemnity**: Both sections emphasize the importance of notifying the Company promptly of any claims and providing assistance for defense, which is a common requirement in indemnity clauses.

IP infringement indemnity that covers trademark or copyright,b7896bb998,"To the extent that such IPRs do not vest automatically in the Company by operation of law, you hereby assign and agree to assign to the Company all of your right, title and interest in any existing and future IPRs which may subsist in any Works for their full term of protection (including any extensions, revivals and renewals) together with the right to sue and claim remedies for past infringement and all materials embodying these rights to the fullest extent permitted by law in any and all countries of the world.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query about IP infringement indemnity that covers trademark or copyright because it addresses the assignment of intellectual property rights (IPRs) from an individual (likely an employee or contractor) to a company. Here’s how it connects to the concepts of trademark and copyright infringement indemnity:

1. **Assignment of Rights**: The clause states that the individual assigns all rights, title, and interest in any existing and future IPRs related to their works to the company. This is crucial because it ensures that the company holds the rights to any trademarks or copyrights that may arise from the individual's work. By assigning these rights, the company can better protect itself against potential infringement claims.

2. **Protection Against Infringement**: The clause includes the right to sue and claim remedies for past infringement. This means that if the company’s rights are infringed upon (for example, if someone uses a trademark or copyrighted work without permission), the company has the legal standing to take action against the infringer. This is a key aspect of indemnity, as it allows the company to defend its interests and seek damages.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The clause mentions that the assignment covers all IPRs for their full term of protection, including extensions, revivals, and renewals. This comprehensive coverage ensures that the company is protected not just for the current rights but also for any future developments or extensions of those rights, which is particularly important in the context of trademarks and copyrights that can evolve over time.

4. **Global Scope**: The clause specifies that the rights are assigned to the fullest extent permitted by law in any and all countries of the world. This global perspective is important for companies operating internationally, as it ensures that their trademark and copyright protections are recognized and enforceable across different jurisdictions.

In summary, this clause is relevant to IP infringement indemnity as it establishes the framework for the assignment of rights, provides the company with the ability to take legal action against infringement, and ensures comprehensive and global protection of intellectual property rights.",5
IP infringement indemnity that covers trademark or copyright,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided addresses liability in the context of intellectual property (IP) rights, specifically mentioning that neither party will be liable for certain types of damages (special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental) except in cases of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Here's how it relates to your query about IP infringement indemnity covering trademark or copyright:

1. **Scope of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply to claims arising from the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if one party is accused of infringing on a third party's trademark or copyright, the limitation on liability would not protect them from claims related to that infringement.

2. **Indemnity Implications**: While the clause does not explicitly mention indemnity, it implies that if a party is found liable for infringing on a third party's IP rights (such as trademarks or copyrights), they may be responsible for damages resulting from that infringement. This could include compensating the affected party for losses incurred due to the infringement.

3. **Protection Against Claims**: The clause serves to protect both parties from being held liable for indirect or consequential damages in general, but it carves out an exception for IP infringement claims. This means that if a party is sued for infringing on a trademark or copyright, they cannot rely on this clause to avoid liability for those specific claims.

4. **Risk Management**: Including such a clause in a contract is a way for parties to manage their risks related to IP infringement. It highlights the importance of being aware of third-party IP rights and taking necessary precautions to avoid infringement, as the consequences can lead to significant liability.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations of liability concerning IP infringement claims, specifically for trademarks and copyrights, and indicates that parties may need to indemnify each other in such cases.",4

As a condition of receiving defense and indemnification under this Section for an Indemnified Claim, the Indemnified Party must: (1) notify and tender the defense of an Indemnified Claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the Indemnified Party learns of the Indemnified Claim; and
(2) provide information and cooperation reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. An Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party of any reasonable, actual, substantiated out-of-pocket expense incurred in providing the requested information or cooperation. e. If the Indemnifying Party accepts the tender of defense of an Indemnified Claim, with or without reservation, the Indemnifying Party will: (1) promptly notify the Indemnified Party of the acceptance of the tender of defense of the Indemnified Claim. (2) control the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim, including, without limitation, the selection of licensed, qualified and reputable attorneys and expert witnesses and all decisions over settlement and litigation strategy. The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f. An Indemnifying Party, acting in good faith, may settle an Indemnified Claim for which it is responsible under this Agreement involving infringement on the intellectual property of a third-party by: (1) obtaining a license from the third-party allowing the required use of its intellectual property; (2) modifying a product, equipment or process in a manner which avoids infringing on the intellectual property of the third-party; or (3) voluntarily withdrawing the infringing product from the market and either refunding the amount paid by the Indemnified Party for the infringing product or replacing the infringing product with a non-infringing product. g. The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The indemnification clause you provided outlines the responsibilities of the parties involved in the agreement regarding defense and indemnification for various claims. To address your query about whether indemnification covers indirect claims, we can analyze the language and structure of the clause.

1. **Definition of Indemnified Claims**: The clause defines an ""Indemnified Claim"" as any claim that a party (the Indemnifying Party) is required to defend and indemnify the other party (the Indemnified Party) under the agreement. This definition is broad and encompasses various types of claims, including those arising from breaches of the agreement, negligence, and infringement of intellectual property.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the defense and indemnification include ""without limitation"" the payment or reimbursement of actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the investigation, defense, and settlement of any civil, criminal, or administrative action. This broad language suggests that the indemnification could extend to indirect claims, as it does not explicitly limit the types of claims covered.

3. **Types of Claims Covered**: The clause explicitly mentions third-party claims for personal injury, damage to tangible property, and other losses. While these examples primarily focus on direct claims, the language used does not preclude the possibility of covering indirect claims, especially if they arise from the same circumstances that lead to direct claims.

4. **Potential for Disputes**: The clause also acknowledges that there may be disagreements between the parties regarding whether a claim qualifies as an Indemnified Claim. This indicates that the interpretation of what constitutes an indemnified claim (including the potential for indirect claims) may be subject to negotiation or dispute resolution.

5. **Good Faith Requirement**: The clause requires the Indemnifying Party to act in good faith when controlling the defense and settlement of an Indemnified Claim. This implies that the parties should consider the broader implications of claims, including indirect consequences, when determining their responsibilities.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly state that indemnification covers indirect claims, its broad language and the types of claims it addresses suggest that indirect claims could be included, depending on the circumstances. The parties may need to clarify this aspect in their negotiations or through dispute resolution if disagreements arise.",4
indemnification covers indirect claims,32762b4bf5,"ARTICLE 9 - INDEMNIFICATION
Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;
(4) If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, with a reservation of all rights to seek indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party; provided, that Indemnitee may enter into a settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the indemnifying party, if the terms of such settlement (i) include only money damages as a remedy, (ii) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on the indemnifying party's business and (iii) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by the indemnifying party; and
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The indemnification clause provided in Article 9 is relevant to the query regarding whether indemnification covers indirect claims. 

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause states that each party agrees to indemnify the other for ""any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability"" that arises from claims made by third parties. This includes claims related to injury or death of a person or loss of or damage to property. The language ""to the extent resulting directly or indirectly"" from the indemnifying party's breach of duty, negligence, or willful misconduct indicates that both direct and indirect claims are covered under this indemnification provision.

2. **Indirect Claims**: The phrase ""directly or indirectly"" is crucial. It suggests that the indemnifying party is responsible not only for losses that arise directly from their actions but also for those that may arise indirectly as a consequence of their actions. This broadens the scope of indemnification to include indirect claims, which could encompass a variety of scenarios where the indemnifying party's actions lead to third-party claims that are not immediately apparent or direct.

3. **Claims Procedure**: The claims procedure outlined in the clause provides a structured approach for how claims are to be handled, ensuring that the indemnified party (Indemnitee) can seek indemnification for both direct and indirect claims. The requirement for the Indemnitee to notify the indemnifying party of any Asserted Liability (which may include indirect claims) ensures that the indemnifying party is aware of potential liabilities and can take appropriate action.

In summary, the indemnification clause explicitly covers indirect claims by stating that indemnification applies to losses resulting ""directly or indirectly"" from the indemnifying party's actions. This broad language ensures that the indemnified party is protected against a wide range of potential claims, including those that may not be immediately obvious or direct.",5

Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The indemnification clause you provided is relevant to the query about whether indemnification covers indirect claims because it outlines the scope of indemnification between the parties involved in the agreement.

1. **Definition of Indemnification**: The clause states that each party agrees to indemnify the other from ""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses."" This broad language suggests that the indemnification is not limited to direct claims but may also encompass indirect claims, as it does not specify a limitation to direct damages.

2. **Connection to Warranties and Representations**: The clause specifies that indemnification applies to claims arising out of or connected with any inconsistency with warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements made in the contract. This could include indirect claims that arise as a consequence of a breach of these warranties or representations.

3. **Legal Costs and Expenses**: The clause explicitly includes ""legal costs and attorneys' fees"" in the indemnification, which can often be associated with both direct and indirect claims. This further supports the notion that the indemnification is comprehensive.

4. **Withholding Payment**: The provision allowing the non-indemnifying party to withhold payment related to any claim, demand, or action indicates that the parties recognize the potential for claims (including indirect ones) that may arise during the course of the agreement.

In summary, the language used in the indemnification clause suggests that it is designed to cover a wide range of claims, potentially including indirect claims, as long as they are connected to the warranties and representations made in the agreement. However, the specific interpretation may depend on the context of the agreement and applicable law.",5

PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement.

The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The indemnification clause you provided outlines the responsibilities of the parties (VS and PPD) to indemnify each other against claims made by third parties due to negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement. 

In the context of your query regarding whether indemnification covers indirect claims, it's important to clarify what is meant by ""indirect claims."" Indirect claims typically refer to claims that are not directly caused by the actions of the indemnifying party but may arise as a consequence of those actions. For example, if a third party suffers damages due to a product defect caused by VS, and as a result, PPD incurs additional costs (like lost profits or reputational damage), those could be considered indirect claims.

The clause specifically mentions that the indemnification applies to ""any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities"" incurred as a result of a ""Third Party Claim."" While the clause does not explicitly state that it covers indirect claims, the broad language used (""any and all damages"") could be interpreted to include indirect claims, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the claim.

However, the interpretation of whether indirect claims are covered can vary based on legal standards and the specific facts of a case. Therefore, while the clause provides a strong basis for indemnification, it may be prudent for the parties to clarify in the contract whether indirect claims are explicitly included or excluded to avoid ambiguity and potential disputes in the future. 

In summary, the relevance of the clause to your query lies in its broad language regarding indemnification, which may encompass indirect claims, but the specific coverage would depend on further clarification or legal interpretation.",4
indemnification covers indirect claims,48a7852086,"7. Indemnification. <omitted> (c) Any and all claims, losses, cost or expenses shall be limited to actual and direct costs. In no event shall any party be responsible to the other for indirect, special or consequential damages.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query about indemnification covering indirect claims because it explicitly limits the scope of indemnification to ""actual and direct costs."" 

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Indemnification Definition**: Indemnification generally refers to a party's obligation to compensate another party for certain losses or damages. This can include a wide range of claims, but the specifics depend on the language of the contract.

2. **Limitation on Claims**: The clause states that ""any and all claims, losses, cost or expenses shall be limited to actual and direct costs."" This means that the indemnifying party is only responsible for compensating the other party for direct losses that can be clearly linked to the indemnified event.

3. **Exclusion of Indirect Claims**: The clause further clarifies that ""in no event shall any party be responsible to the other for indirect, special or consequential damages."" This explicitly excludes indirect claims from the indemnification obligation. Indirect claims typically refer to damages that are not a direct result of an action but rather a secondary consequence (e.g., lost profits, loss of business opportunities).

In summary, this clause indicates that while indemnification is provided, it does not extend to indirect claims, thereby protecting the indemnifying party from liability for such claims. This is crucial for understanding the limits of liability and the nature of the indemnification obligations in the contract.",5

1. **Definition of Claims**: The clause defines a ""Claim"" as any action or proceeding instituted by a third party, which is crucial for understanding the scope of indemnification.

This broad scope ensures that the Indemnified Party is protected from various potential liabilities that could arise from the Indemnifying Party's actions.

3. **Exclusions and Limitations**: The clause also includes limitations on liability in Section 8.2, stating that neither party will be liable for consequential damages, except in specific circumstances, such as when a third party is awarded damages against a party that is entitled to indemnification. This means that while the parties are protected from certain types of damages, they still have a mechanism for addressing claims that may arise from third-party actions.

4. **Procedural Requirements**: The clause mentions that the indemnification is subject to a procedure outlined in Section 7.3, which likely details how claims should be handled, including notification and defense obligations. This procedural aspect is important for ensuring that both parties understand their responsibilities in the event of a claim.

This means that if a third party brings a claim against one party due to the negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement by the other party, the responsible party must cover the costs associated with that claim.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause clearly defines the circumstances under which indemnification is applicable, specifically focusing on third-party claims. This is relevant because it establishes that indemnification is not for first-party claims (claims made by one party against the other) but rather for claims made by external parties.

3. **Notice and Control of Defense**: The clause requires the indemnified party to promptly notify the indemnifying party of any third-party claims. It also grants the indemnifying party the right to control the defense and settlement of such claims, which is a standard practice in indemnification clauses. This ensures that the party responsible for the claim can manage the legal strategy and costs associated with it.

4. **Participation Rights**: The indemnified party retains the right to participate in the defense of the claim, although it cannot control it unless certain conditions are met (e.g., if the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense). This provision allows the indemnified party to protect its interests while still relying on the indemnifying party to handle the primary defense.

In summary, while the clause primarily addresses indemnification related to third-party claims, it is relevant to your query as it establishes the framework for how indemnification operates between the parties. It clarifies that indemnification is not applicable to first-party claims, which would be claims made directly between VS and PPD. Understanding this distinction is crucial for interpreting the rights and responsibilities of each party under the agreement.",4

Subject to Section 7.3 [Procedure], the Indemnifying Party will pay any award against the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors or representatives) and any costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by them resulting from any such Claim.","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations of the parties involved in the contract, specifically addressing how one party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") will protect the other party (the ""Indemnified Party"") from claims made by third parties. This is directly relevant to your query about ""indemnification of first party claims"" for several reasons:

1. **Definition of Claims**: The clause defines a ""Claim"" as any action or proceeding initiated by a third party, which is crucial for understanding the scope of indemnification. It clarifies that the indemnification applies to claims made by entities that are not affiliated with either party, ensuring that the indemnification is focused on external threats rather than internal disputes.

2. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause specifies the circumstances under which the Indemnifying Party is responsible for indemnifying the Indemnified Party. This includes claims arising from the operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's site, the marketing or sale of products, breaches of representations or warranties, and infringement of intellectual property rights. This broad scope ensures that the Indemnified Party is protected from various potential liabilities that could arise from the Indemnifying Party's actions.

3. **Exclusions**: The clause also notes exceptions to the indemnification obligations, particularly regarding items or materials supplied by the Indemnified Party. This is important because it delineates the boundaries of responsibility, indicating that the Indemnified Party cannot seek indemnification for claims arising from its own contributions.

4. **Procedural Requirements**: The reference to Section 7.3 [Procedure] suggests that there are specific procedures that must be followed for the indemnification to be enacted. This is relevant for ensuring that claims are handled appropriately and that the Indemnifying Party is given the opportunity to defend against claims.

5. **Financial Responsibility**: The clause states that the Indemnifying Party will cover any awards against the Indemnified Party, as well as reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in relation to the claims. This financial aspect is a key component of indemnification, as it ensures that the Indemnified Party is not left bearing the costs associated with defending against third-party claims.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query about indemnification of first-party claims because it establishes the framework for how one party will protect the other from third-party claims, the conditions under which indemnification applies, and the financial responsibilities involved. It clarifies the roles and obligations of each party in the event of a claim, which is essential for understanding the overall risk management strategy within the contract.",5

The respective parties shall indemnify and hold one another harmless as follows:
1. MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any MICOA act or omission, except to the extent the Agency has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.
2. Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to your query about indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless"" provisions. Here's how it relates:

1. **Indemnification and Hold Harmless**: The clause explicitly states that both parties (MICOA and Agency) agree to indemnify and hold each other harmless. This means that if one party incurs losses, damages, or liabilities due to the actions or omissions of the other party, the responsible party will compensate the affected party and protect them from any claims arising from those actions.

2. **Mutual Indemnification**: The clause outlines a mutual indemnification agreement, where both parties have obligations to indemnify each other. This is a common practice in contracts to ensure that both parties are protected from potential liabilities that may arise from their respective actions.

3. **Conditions of Indemnification**: The clause includes specific conditions under which indemnification applies. For example, MICOA is only required to indemnify the Agency for its own acts or omissions, except when the Agency has contributed to the error. Similarly, the Agency is only required to indemnify MICOA for its own acts or omissions, except when MICOA has contributed to the error. This establishes a clear framework for liability and responsibility, which is crucial in legal agreements.

4. **Risk Allocation**: By including this indemnification and hold harmless language, the parties are effectively allocating risk between themselves. Each party is taking responsibility for its own actions while also providing a level of protection to the other party, which is a key aspect of risk management in contracts.

In summary, this clause exemplifies the use of indemnification and hold harmless provisions in contracts, addressing how parties will handle liabilities arising from their actions and ensuring mutual protection against claims.",5

1. **Indemnification**: The clause establishes that one party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") agrees to indemnify the other party (the ""Indemnified Party"") against various claims and liabilities. This is a key aspect of indemnification, as it outlines the responsibility of one party to cover the losses or damages incurred by the other party due to specific actions or omissions.

2. **Hold Harmless**: The phrase ""hold harmless"" is explicitly included in the clause. This means that the Indemnifying Party not only agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party but also ensures that the Indemnified Party will not be held liable for certain claims or damages. Essentially, it protects the Indemnified Party from legal repercussions that may arise from the Indemnifying Party's actions.

3. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause details the scope of indemnification, specifying that it covers a wide range of potential issues, including negligence, breaches of contract, violations of laws, and intellectual property infringements. This broad coverage is important for ensuring that the Indemnified Party is protected against various risks associated with the agreement.

4. **Parties Involved**: The clause identifies the parties involved in the indemnification process, including their officers, directors, agents, employees, and affiliates.

Indemnification clauses typically require one party to compensate another for certain damages or losses that may arise from specific actions or events. A ""hold harmless"" provision is often included in these clauses, which means that one party agrees not to hold the other party responsible for certain liabilities or claims.

The specific clause you provided states that the indemnities do not cover ""consequential, punitive, special or similar damages, including, without limitation, lost profits."" This is significant for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: By excluding these types of damages, the clause protects the indemnifying party from having to pay for potentially large and unpredictable losses that could arise from a breach or other liability. This is a common practice in indemnification clauses to limit exposure.

2. **Clarity and Predictability**: The clause provides clarity to both parties about what types of damages are covered and what are not. This helps in managing expectations and reduces the risk of disputes over what constitutes indemnifiable losses.

3. **Risk Management**: Including such limitations in an indemnification clause is a way for parties to manage their risk. It allows them to agree on the scope of indemnification without exposing themselves to unlimited liability.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly mention ""hold harmless,"" it is closely related to the concept of indemnification and serves to define the boundaries of liability, which is a critical aspect of indemnification agreements.",4

1. **Indemnification**: The clause begins with a clear statement that the Indemnitor will ""defend, indemnify and hold harmless"" the Indemnitee. This phrase is a standard formulation in indemnification clauses, indicating that the Indemnitor is responsible for covering certain losses or damages incurred by the Indemnitee.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies the types of claims for which the Indemnitor is responsible. These include:
   - Breaches of obligations, warranties, or representations in the agreement.
   - Claims related to personal injury or property damage due to the Indemnitor's fault or negligence.
   - Claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

3. **Hold Harmless**: The term ""hold harmless"" is included in the indemnification language, which means that the Indemnitor agrees to protect the Indemnitee from any legal liability or financial loss arising from the specified claims. This is a critical aspect of indemnification, as it ensures that the Indemnitee will not suffer financial consequences due to the actions or failures of the Indemnitor.

4. **Exclusions**: The clause also includes a limitation on liability in Section 12.2, which states that neither party will be liable for certain types of damages (indirect, special, incidental, etc.) except for claims made under Section 12.1.

ARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY","The clause you provided includes elements of indemnification, which is relevant to your query about indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless"" provisions. Here's how it relates:

1. **Indemnification by Parties**: Sections 11.1 and 11.2 (though omitted) likely outline the specific indemnification obligations of each party (Xencor and Aimmune). Indemnification clauses typically require one party to compensate the other for certain damages or losses, which may include legal fees, costs, or liabilities arising from specific events or actions.

2. **Hold Harmless Language**: While the specific ""hold harmless"" language is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, indemnification clauses often include a ""hold harmless"" provision as part of their structure. This means that one party agrees to protect the other from any claims, damages, or losses that may arise from certain actions or events. The indemnification obligations in sections 11.1 and 11.2 may implicitly include this concept.

3. **Limitation of Liability**: Section 11.4 addresses the limitation of liability, stating that neither party will be liable for certain types of damages (like lost profits or indirect damages) arising from breaches of the agreement. However, it explicitly states that this limitation does not affect the indemnification rights or obligations outlined in sections 11.1 and 11.2. This is important because it ensures that indemnification obligations (which may include hold harmless provisions) are not limited by the liability restrictions, thereby providing a broader scope of protection for the parties involved.

4. **Confidentiality Obligations**: The reference to confidentiality obligations in Article 12 indicates that breaches of confidentiality are treated separately and may have different consequences, which could also involve indemnification. This further emphasizes the importance of the indemnification clauses in protecting against various types of claims.

Here’s how it addresses the key aspects of your query:

1. **Indemnification and Defense**: The clause explicitly states that each party will ""defend, at its own expense, indemnify and hold harmless the other party."" This indicates that not only will the indemnifying party cover the costs associated with any claims, but they will also take on the responsibility of defending against those claims. This dual obligation is a critical component of indemnification clauses that include defense provisions.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause outlines specific circumstances under which indemnification applies, such as breaches of the agreement, breaches of representations or warranties, and negligence or willful misconduct. This specificity helps clarify the situations in which one party is obligated to defend and indemnify the other, which is essential for understanding the extent of the indemnification.

3. **Control of Defense**: The clause grants the indemnifying party the ""sole right to control the defense"" of any claims. This is a common feature in indemnification clauses, as it allows the indemnifying party to manage the legal strategy and decisions related to the defense, which can be crucial in minimizing liability and costs.

4. **Notification and Cooperation**: The requirement for the indemnified party to ""promptly notify the other in writing of any such claim or action"" and to provide ""full information and assistance"" is a standard practice in indemnification clauses. It ensures that the indemnifying party is aware of claims in a timely manner and can prepare an adequate defense.

5. **Settlement Rights**: The clause specifies that the indemnifying party must obtain the prior written consent of the indemnified party for any settlement that could impose obligations on the indemnified party or affect its liability or public image. This protects the interests of the indemnified party and ensures that they are not bound by unfavorable settlements.

6. **Survival of Obligations**: The clause states that the indemnification obligations will survive the termination of the agreement for a specified period, which is important for ensuring that parties remain protected from claims that may arise after the contract has ended.

In summary, this indemnification clause comprehensively addresses the elements of defending claims, including the obligations of the indemnifying party, the rights of the indemnified party, and the procedures to be followed in the event of a claim. It serves as a robust example of how indemnification clauses can be structured to include defense responsibilities.",5

indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,988610fe80,"Section 9.1 Indemnification.

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause establishes that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from losses arising from the Indemnifying Party's material breach of the agreement. This indicates that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for covering the costs associated with defending against claims that fall within the scope of indemnification.

2. **Control of Defense**: While the clause does not explicitly state that the Indemnifying Party has control over the defense, the language ""agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless"" implies that the Indemnifying Party would typically have the right to control the defense of any claims that arise from its own breaches. This is a common practice in indemnification clauses, where the indemnifying party not only pays for the losses but also manages the legal defense strategy.

3. **Limitation on Liability**: The clause includes a limitation on liability, stating that indemnification applies only to losses arising from the Indemnifying Party's material breach, except where losses are primarily caused by the Indemnified Party. This limitation can affect how the indemnifying party approaches the defense, as it may focus on demonstrating that the losses were not primarily caused by the Indemnified Party.

4. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause defines the scope of indemnification, which is crucial for determining what types of claims the Indemnifying Party will control the defense for. It specifically mentions ""Losses imposed upon or incurred by an Indemnified Party,"" which indicates that the Indemnifying Party's control over the defense is tied to the nature of the claims being made.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly state that the Indemnifying Party has control over the defense, the language used implies that the Indemnifying Party would typically have that right, especially since it is responsible for indemnifying and defending the Indemnified Parties against claims arising from its own breaches.

1. **Indemnifying Party's Control**: The clause explicitly states that the Indemnifying Party has the right to control the defense of any claims, demands, or actions that arise from their negligent acts or omissions. This is evident in the language that allows the Indemnifying Party to settle or defend claims at their own expense and with counsel of their own selection.

2. **Notification Requirement**: The clause requires the Indemnified Party to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of any claims that may trigger the indemnification obligations. This notification is crucial as it allows the Indemnifying Party to take timely action to control the defense.

3. **Opportunity to Defend**: The clause provides the Indemnifying Party with a ""reasonable opportunity"" to settle or defend the claim. This means that the Indemnifying Party has the first right to manage the defense before the Indemnified Party can step in.

4. **Participation Rights**: While the Indemnifying Party controls the defense, the Indemnified Party retains the right to fully participate in the defense. This ensures that the Indemnified Party can still be involved in the proceedings, even though the Indemnifying Party has primary control.

5. **Fallback Provision**: If the Indemnifying Party fails to take appropriate steps to defend the claim within a reasonable time after being notified, the Indemnified Party has the right (but not the obligation) to undertake the defense themselves.

To address the query regarding control over defenses, the clause could be modified to include language that explicitly allows the Indemnifying Party to control the defense of any claims for which they are providing indemnification. This is typically done by adding a provision that states the Indemnifying Party has the right to assume the defense of any claim, lawsuit, or proceeding, and that the Indemnified Parties must cooperate in that defense.

For example, the clause could be expanded as follows:

```plaintext
10.2 Control of Defense. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any claim, lawsuit, or proceeding for which it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Parties shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such claim and shall have the right to participate in the defense at their own expense.
```

This addition clarifies that the Indemnifying Party has control over the defense, which is crucial for managing legal risks and costs effectively. It also ensures that the Indemnified Parties are involved in the process, particularly in terms of settlement decisions.",5
indemnification clause that allows indemnifying party to control defenses,6febf32b96,"10. INDEMNIFICATION
10.1 Indemnification. Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their
respective employees, directors, officers, agents and successors (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all losses (including all costs,
liabilities (including present and future damages), claims and expenses) incurred or suffered by any of the Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising
out of, relating to or resulting from (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement; or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement.","The provided indemnification clause outlines the responsibilities of the ""Indemnifying Party"" to protect the ""Indemnified Parties"" from losses arising from specific circumstances, such as breaches of the agreement or gross negligence. However, it does not explicitly grant the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense against claims made by third parties.

To address your query regarding the control of defenses, an effective indemnification clause should include language that allows the Indemnifying Party to manage the defense of any claims for which they are providing indemnification. This typically involves adding a provision that states the Indemnifying Party has the right to assume control of the defense and settlement of any claims, with the obligation to keep the Indemnified Parties informed and to obtain their consent for any settlement that would affect their rights.

Here’s an example of how you might modify the clause to include this control:

```plaintext
10.2 Control of Defense. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any claim for which it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties, provided that it gives prompt written notice to the Indemnified Parties of its intention to do so. The Indemnified Parties shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, if such settlement would impose any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Parties.
```

In summary, while the original clause establishes the obligation to indemnify, it lacks the specific provision that allows the Indemnifying Party to control the defense of claims. Adding such language would make the clause more aligned with your query regarding control over defenses.",5
Indemnity of broad-based claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The clause you provided outlines the indemnification obligations of each party in the agreement, which is directly relevant to the query regarding ""indemnity of broad-based claims."" Here’s how the clause relates to the concept of broad-based indemnity:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that each party agrees to indemnify the other for ""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses."" This broad language indicates that the indemnity covers a wide range of potential claims, not limited to specific types or categories. This aligns with the idea of broad-based indemnity, as it encompasses various scenarios that could arise from the actions or failures of the indemnifying party.

2. **Connection to Warranties and Representations**: The indemnification is tied to claims that are ""inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements"" made in the agreement. This means that if a party's actions or omissions lead to a claim that contradicts what they have promised in the contract, they are responsible for indemnifying the other party. This reinforces the broad nature of the indemnity, as it covers a wide array of potential breaches.

3. **Legal Costs and Expenses**: The clause explicitly includes ""legal costs and attorneys' fees"" in the indemnification obligations. This is significant because it ensures that the indemnified party is not only protected from the direct claims but also from the financial burden of defending against those claims. This further emphasizes the broad protection offered by the indemnity.

4. **Right to Withhold Payment**: The provision that allows the non-indemnifying party to withhold payment pending the resolution of a claim adds a layer of protection. It indicates that if a claim arises, the non-indemnifying party can take proactive measures to safeguard its interests, which is a common feature in broad indemnity clauses.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to the query about broad-based claims because it establishes a comprehensive framework for indemnity that covers a wide range of potential claims and liabilities, ensuring that each party is protected against various risks associated with the agreement.",5
Indemnity of broad-based claims,596576fcc8,"Section 5.04 Limitations. The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under this Agreement shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall […***…] for such claims until the […***…] of the […***…] shall […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the […***…] of the [… ***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], and (ii) the Indemnifying Party's […***…] for [… ***…] shall not […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…]. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 5.04, the limitations provided in this Section 5.04 shall not apply to (i) any claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (ii) any claim for breach of any agreement or covenant contained herein.","The clause you provided outlines the limitations of liability for the Indemnifying Party in the context of indemnity claims under the agreement. This is particularly relevant to the query about ""indemnity of broad-based claims"" because it specifies the conditions under which the Indemnifying Party can be held liable for claims made against them.

Here’s how the clause relates to the query:

1. **Limitations on Liability**: The clause sets forth specific limitations on the Indemnifying Party's liability for claims. This is crucial in indemnity agreements, as it defines the extent to which one party can be held responsible for losses or damages incurred by another party. The limitations may include caps on the amount of liability or conditions that must be met before liability arises.

2. **Scope of Claims**: The clause indicates that the Indemnifying Party's liability is contingent upon certain conditions being met (e.g., the occurrence of specific events or thresholds). This is relevant for broad-based claims, as it clarifies that not all claims will automatically result in liability; rather, there are specific criteria that must be satisfied.

3. **Exclusions from Limitations**: The clause explicitly states that certain types of claims—such as those involving fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or breaches of specific agreements—are exempt from the limitations outlined. This is significant for broad-based claims, as it highlights that serious allegations or breaches may not be subject to the same limitations, thereby allowing for full accountability in those instances.

4. **Legal Protection**: By defining these limitations and exclusions, the clause serves to protect the Indemnifying Party from potentially overwhelming liability while still holding them accountable for serious misconduct. This balance is essential in indemnity agreements, where one party seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with the actions of another.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query about indemnity of broad-based claims as it delineates the boundaries of liability for the Indemnifying Party, specifies the conditions under which they can be held liable, and identifies exceptions to those limitations, thereby shaping the overall framework of indemnity within the agreement.",4

1. **Scope of Indemnity**: The clause specifies that Berkshire shall indemnify Auriemma against ""any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, damages and expenses."" This broad language indicates that the indemnity covers a wide range of potential claims, which aligns with the idea of broad-based claims. It suggests that Berkshire is responsible for a comprehensive array of liabilities that may arise in connection with the agreement.

2. **Types of Claims Covered**: The clause explicitly includes claims arising from inaccuracies or breaches of representations, warranties, and covenants made by Berkshire. This means that if any of these issues lead to legal actions or financial losses, Berkshire is obligated to indemnify Auriemma. This broad coverage is essential in protecting Auriemma from various potential risks associated with the agreement.

3. **Inclusion of Legal Costs**: The clause also mentions that indemnity includes ""reasonable attorneys', consultants' and experts' fees."" This further emphasizes the broad nature of the indemnity, as it not only covers direct claims but also the associated legal costs, which can be significant in the context of litigation.

4. **Gross Negligence**: The clause specifically mentions that indemnity applies even in cases of gross negligence by Berkshire. This inclusion broadens the scope of indemnity, ensuring that Auriemma is protected even in more severe situations where Berkshire's actions may be deemed particularly negligent.

5. **Notice Requirement**: The requirement for Berkshire to be given prompt notice of any claims or actions is a standard provision in indemnity clauses. It ensures that Berkshire has the opportunity to respond to claims and manage its defense, which is important in the context of broad-based claims that may arise.

In summary, this indemnity clause is relevant to the query about broad-based claims because it establishes a wide-ranging obligation for Berkshire to protect Auriemma from various potential legal and financial liabilities arising from the agreement, thereby ensuring comprehensive coverage against a multitude of claims.",5

It is particularly relevant to the query about ""indemnity of broad-based claims"" in the following ways:

1. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or enhanced damages, as well as lost profits or revenues. This limitation is crucial in indemnity situations, as it defines the scope of what can be claimed in the event of a breach. Broad-based claims often encompass a wide range of damages, and this clause effectively narrows the potential recovery to direct damages only.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause makes a specific exception for indemnification obligations set forth in Section 9 regarding claims by third parties. This indicates that while the parties may limit their liability for direct claims against each other, they still have a responsibility to indemnify each other for certain third-party claims. This is significant in the context of indemnity, as it suggests that the parties recognize the need to protect each other from external claims that could arise from their actions or breaches.

3. **Foreseeability and Notification**: The clause also states that the limitation on liability applies regardless of whether the damages were foreseeable or whether the parties were advised of the possibility of such damages. This reinforces the idea that the parties have agreed to limit their exposure to broad-based claims, even if those claims could have been anticipated.

4. **Legal Theories**: The clause mentions that the limitation applies regardless of the legal or equitable theory upon which the claim is based (contract, tort, etc.). This broadens the scope of the limitation, indicating that it applies to various types of claims, which is relevant when considering the potential for broad-based claims that could arise from different legal theories.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query about indemnity of broad-based claims because it establishes the framework for liability limitations between the parties, clarifies the scope of indemnification obligations, and sets boundaries on the types of damages that can be claimed, thereby influencing how broad-based claims are handled under the agreement.",5

This is highly relevant to your query about ""indemnity of broad-based claims"" for several reasons:

1. **Definition of Indemnified Claims**: The clause defines what constitutes an ""Indemnified Claim,"" which includes a wide range of potential claims, such as civil, criminal, or administrative actions. This broad definition allows for a wide array of claims to be covered under the indemnification provisions, which aligns with the concept of broad-based claims.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the indemnification includes not only the defense against claims but also the payment of expenses related to the investigation, defense, and settlement of those claims. This broad scope ensures that the Indemnified Party is protected from various types of claims and associated costs, which is a key aspect of broad-based indemnity.

3. **Specific Indemnification Obligations**: The clause outlines specific scenarios in which each party (Seller and Buyer) must indemnify the other. For example, Seller must indemnify Buyer for claims related to breaches of the agreement, negligence, product liability, and infringement claims. This specificity helps clarify the extent of indemnity and reinforces the broad nature of the claims covered.

4. **Conditions for Indemnification**: The clause sets forth conditions that the Indemnified Party must meet to receive indemnification, such as promptly notifying the Indemnifying Party of an Indemnified Claim and cooperating in the defense. This ensures that the indemnification process is structured and that both parties understand their responsibilities.

5. **Conflict Resolution**: The clause also addresses potential conflicts of interest between the parties regarding indemnified claims. It provides a mechanism for resolving such conflicts, which is important in maintaining the integrity of the indemnification process and ensuring that both parties can adequately defend their interests.

6. **Good Faith Requirement**: The requirement for the Indemnifying Party to act in good faith when controlling the defense and settlement of claims emphasizes the importance of fair dealings in the indemnification process, which is a critical aspect of broad-based indemnity.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to the query about broad-based claims because it establishes a comprehensive framework for how indemnity is to be handled between the parties, covering a wide range of potential claims and outlining the responsibilities and rights of each party in the indemnification process.",5

The relevance to your query about whether the ""indemnified party includes affiliates"" can be inferred from the language used in the clause.

1. **Definition of Affiliates**: The clause explicitly mentions ""Party B and its affiliates,"" indicating that any rights, responsibilities, or obligations that apply to Party B also extend to its affiliates. This suggests that the affiliates are included in the scope of the agreement.

2. **Indemnification Context**: In legal contracts, indemnification clauses typically protect certain parties from liability or claims arising from the actions of another party. If the agreement includes an indemnification clause (not provided in your excerpt), it would be important to clarify whether ""Party B and its affiliates"" are covered under that indemnification. 

3. **Implications for Indemnification**: If Party B is indemnified for actions taken in the course of fulfilling its obligations under the agreement, and if affiliates are included in the definition of Party B, then the affiliates would also be indemnified. This means that if any claims arise from the activities of Party B or its affiliates in relation to the cooperation channel, both Party B and its affiliates would be protected under the indemnification provisions.

In summary, the clause establishes that Party B's affiliates are part of the agreement, which implies that they may also be included in any indemnification provisions, should they exist in the full contract.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant parts:

1. **Definition of Indemnified Party**: The clause refers to the ""Indemnified Party"" as the other party involved in the agreement, and it clearly states that this includes ""its Affiliates."" This means that any claims or actions that arise under the indemnity provision will also protect the affiliates of the Indemnified Party.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: The indemnity obligation outlined in Section 7.2 specifies that the Indemnifying Party (the party providing indemnity) will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Indemnified Party and its affiliates from various claims, costs, and damages. This reinforces the idea that affiliates are included in the protection offered by the indemnity clause.

3. **Implications for Affiliates**: By including affiliates in the definition of the Indemnified Party, the clause ensures that any claims arising from the actions or omissions of the Indemnifying Party that affect the Indemnified Party will also extend to its affiliates. This is significant for risk management and liability considerations, as it broadens the scope of protection for the Indemnified Party's network of affiliated entities.

Indemnified party includes affiliates,1618943a84,"Notwithstanding the foregoing, no rights, obligations or liabilities hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without prior written consent of all of the other Parties; provided, however, that a Party shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to the assignment of rights and obligations by the other Parties to its Affiliate if that Affiliate's performance has been guaranteed satisfactorily in form and substance by the assigning Party.","The clause you provided addresses the assignability of rights and obligations under the contract, specifically in relation to affiliates of the parties involved. Here’s how it relates to your query about whether the indemnified party includes affiliates:

1. **Definition of Affiliates**: In many legal contexts, ""affiliates"" refer to entities that are related to a party, typically through ownership or control. This clause acknowledges that a party may assign its rights and obligations to its affiliates.

2. **Assignment of Rights and Obligations**: The clause states that a party cannot assign its rights and obligations without the prior written consent of the other parties. However, it makes an exception for assignments to affiliates, provided that the performance of the affiliate is guaranteed satisfactorily by the assigning party. This means that if a party wants to assign its rights and obligations to an affiliate, it can do so more easily than it could with a non-affiliate, as long as the conditions are met.

3. **Indemnified Party Context**: If the indemnified party is defined to include affiliates, this clause would allow the parties to assign their rights and obligations to their affiliates without unreasonable hindrance. This is particularly relevant in indemnification scenarios, where the performance of obligations (such as defending against claims or providing compensation) may be delegated to an affiliate.

The clause ensures that the parties can transfer their responsibilities to their affiliates while maintaining the integrity of the indemnification process, as long as the affiliate's performance is guaranteed.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query because it clarifies the conditions under which a party can assign its rights and obligations to its affiliates, which directly impacts how indemnification responsibilities may be handled if affiliates are included as indemnified parties.",4

3. **Notice and Control of Defense**: The clause requires the indemnified party to promptly notify the indemnifying party of any third-party claims. It also grants the indemnifying party the right to control the defense and settlement of such claims, provided they act reasonably and in good faith. This is important for managing legal risks and ensuring that the defense is handled appropriately.

4. **Cooperation and Separate Counsel**: The indemnified party is required to cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of the claim. However, they also have the right to participate in the defense and can employ separate legal counsel at their own expense, unless certain conditions are met (e.g., authorization by the indemnifying party or failure of the indemnifying party to assume the defense).

5. **First-Party Indemnification Context**: While the clause primarily addresses third-party claims, it indirectly relates to first-party indemnification by establishing a framework for how claims are managed between the parties.

2. **Limitations on Liability**: The clause includes specific limitations on the Indemnifying Party's liability, indicating that they will only be liable for claims up to a certain point (e.g., after certain conditions are met). This is particularly relevant for broad-based claims, as it clarifies that not all claims will result in full liability for the Indemnifying Party, which can significantly affect the risk assessment for the parties involved.

3. **Exclusions from Limitations**: The clause explicitly states that certain types of claims (e.g., fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or breach of specific agreements) are exempt from the limitations on liability. This is important for understanding the potential exposure of the Indemnifying Party in the event of broad-based claims that may fall into these excluded categories.

4. **First Party vs. Third Party Claims**: While the clause does not explicitly differentiate between first-party and third-party claims, the context of indemnification often involves both. First-party indemnification typically refers to claims made by one party against another within the agreement, while third-party claims involve external parties. The limitations outlined in the clause would apply to first-party claims as well, thus impacting how such claims are managed and resolved.

1. **Definition of Claim**: The clause begins by defining a ""Claim"" as any action or proceeding initiated by a third party, which is crucial for understanding the scope of indemnification. This definition includes claims from governmental authorities, indicating that the indemnification covers a wide range of potential third-party claims.

2. **Indemnification Scope**: Section 7.2 specifies that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for defending and indemnifying the Indemnified Party against any claims arising from various specified circumstances. This includes:
   - The operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's site.
   - The marketing or sale of products or services through that site.
   - Breaches of representations or warranties.
   - Infringement of intellectual property rights.

   This broad scope ensures that the Indemnified Party is protected from a wide array of potential claims that could arise from the Indemnifying Party's actions or omissions.

3. **Financial Responsibility**: The clause also states that the Indemnifying Party will cover any awards against the Indemnified Party and their affiliates, as well as any reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred due to such claims. This financial responsibility is a key aspect of indemnification, ensuring that the Indemnified Party does not bear the financial burden of defending against third-party claims.

4. **Limitations on Liability**: Section 8.2 further clarifies the limitations on liability, stating that neither party will be liable for consequential damages, except in cases where a third party has been awarded damages against a party that is entitled to indemnification. This reinforces the importance of the indemnification clause, as it highlights that the indemnification obligations are a primary means of addressing potential liabilities arising from third-party claims.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes the framework for indemnification concerning broad-based third-party claims, detailing the responsibilities of the Indemnifying Party and the protections afforded to the Indemnified Party.",5

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause specifies that the Application Provider is required to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Excite@Home and its affiliates from any and all third-party claims. This means that if a third party brings a claim against Excite@Home related to the Application Provider's actions or content, the Application Provider is responsible for covering the costs associated with that claim.

   - **Breach of Warranty**: If the Application Provider breaches any warranty, representation, or covenant in the agreement, they are liable for any resulting third-party claims.

3. **Exclusions**: The clause explicitly excludes claims based on Excite Content or any other materials provided by Excite in their original form. This limitation is important as it delineates the boundaries of the Application Provider's indemnification responsibilities.

4. **Limitation of Liability**: The subsequent section (20) outlines limitations on liability, which is relevant in the context of indemnification. It clarifies that neither party will be liable for indirect damages, and the liability is limited to direct damages.

In summary, this clause is crucial for understanding the indemnification responsibilities of the Application Provider regarding broad-based third-party claims, as it outlines the conditions under which indemnification is required, the types of claims covered, and the limitations on liability.",5

This is directly relevant to your query regarding the indemnification of broad-based third-party claims, as it specifies the circumstances under which each party must defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party and its representatives from various types of claims.

Here’s how the clause addresses the query:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause establishes that both parties (Network Affiliate and NCM) have obligations to indemnify each other against ""any and all third party claims, suits, actions, or proceedings."" This broad language indicates that the indemnification covers a wide range of potential claims that could arise from the actions or omissions of either party.

2. **Specific Indemnification Obligations**:
   - **Network Affiliate Indemnification (Section 10.1)**: This section specifies that Network Affiliate must indemnify NCM for claims arising from breaches of the agreement, infringement of intellectual property rights, unauthorized use of NCM property, and Network Affiliate's own misconduct.
   - **NCM General Indemnification (Section 10.2)**: Similarly, NCM must indemnify Network Affiliate for claims arising from breaches of the agreement and NCM's own misconduct.

3. **Infringement Claims (Section 10.3)**: This section specifically addresses claims related to intellectual property infringement, which is a common type of third-party claim. It outlines NCM's obligations to indemnify Network Affiliate for claims arising from the use of NCM property, provided that the use complies with the agreement.

4. **Control of Defense (Section 10.4)**: The clause grants the indemnifying party (Indemnitor) the right to control the defense and settlement of claims, while also allowing the indemnified party (Indemnitee) to participate at their own expense. This is important in managing how claims are handled and ensuring that both parties are involved in the process.

5. **Limitations and Conditions**: The clause also includes limitations on indemnification, specifying circumstances under which indemnification may not apply (e.g., if the claim arises from the Indemnitee's own actions or modifications). This helps to clarify the boundaries of indemnification obligations.

Here’s how it relates to your query about third-party claims and indemnity concerning fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: 
   - **Sections 12.1 and 12.2** outline the indemnification responsibilities of both parties (BLI and Ginkgo). Each party agrees to indemnify the other for claims brought by third parties that arise from specific actions, including negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct by their respective indemnitees (officers, directors, employees, etc.). This means that if a third party brings a claim against one party due to the actions of the other party (e.g., due to negligence or fraud), the responsible party must cover the costs associated with that claim, including legal fees and damages.

2. **Exclusions from Liability Limitations**:
   - **Sections 11.6 and 11.7** specify that certain types of claims are excluded from the limitations on liability. Notably, claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct are not subject to the liability caps outlined in these sections. This means that if a party engages in fraudulent or willfully negligent behavior, they cannot limit their liability for resulting damages, which is crucial in protecting the other party from significant losses due to such misconduct.

3. **Third-Party Claims**:
   - The term ""Claims"" in the indemnification sections refers to suits or claims brought by third parties. The indemnification clauses ensure that if a third party alleges that they suffered damages due to the actions of one party (whether through negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct), the indemnifying party is responsible for defending against those claims and covering any associated losses.

4. **Legal and Financial Protection**:
   - The indemnification provisions provide a framework for legal and financial protection for both parties. If either party is found liable for fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct that leads to a third-party claim, the indemnification clauses ensure that the responsible party will bear the costs, thus protecting the other party from financial harm.

In summary, the clauses you provided are directly relevant to your query as they establish the framework for indemnification in the event of third-party claims arising from fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct. They clarify the responsibilities of each party in such scenarios and outline the limitations on liability, ensuring that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct.",5

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: 
   - **Section 12.1 (Indemnification by BLI)** and **Section 12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo)** outline the indemnification responsibilities of each party (BLI and Ginkgo) towards the other party and their affiliates. Both sections specify that each party will indemnify the other for claims brought by third parties that arise from various causes, including:
     - Breach of the agreement or material inaccuracies in representations or warranties.
     - Negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct by the indemnifying party or its affiliates.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: 
   - The indemnity covers ""any and all suits, claims, proceedings and causes of action brought by a Third Party"" and includes associated damages, liabilities, expenses, and losses. This means that if a third party brings a claim against Ginkgo due to BLI's negligence or fraud, BLI is obligated to indemnify Ginkgo for those claims.

3. **Exclusions from Liability Limitations**: 
   - **Section 11.6 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 11.7 (Liability Limit)** specify that certain types of damages and liabilities are excluded from the limitations set forth in those sections. Notably, claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct are explicitly excluded from the liability limitations. This means that if a party commits fraud or acts with gross negligence or willful misconduct, they cannot limit their liability for those actions.

4. **Legal and Equitable Theories**: 
   - The liability limitations apply under various legal theories, including tort (which encompasses negligence). However, the indemnification obligations remain intact regardless of these limitations, ensuring that parties are held accountable for serious misconduct.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a framework for indemnification in the event of third-party claims arising from fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct. It ensures that the parties are protected against such claims and outlines the responsibilities of each party to indemnify the other in these circumstances.",5

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**: This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, such as lost profits or indirect damages, arising from the agreement. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for certain serious breaches, including:
   - Fraud
   - Gross negligence
   - Willful misconduct
   - Indemnification obligations under Article 12

   This means that if a party commits fraud, is grossly negligent, or engages in willful misconduct, they cannot rely on this clause to avoid liability for consequential damages. This is particularly relevant in the context of third-party claims, as it indicates that if a party's actions lead to a third-party claim based on these serious issues, they may be held liable for damages that would otherwise be excluded.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**: This section limits a party's aggregate liability to a specified amount, but it also includes exceptions for:
   - Breach of confidentiality
   - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct
   - Indemnification obligations

   This means that if a third-party claim arises due to a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the liability limit does not apply. The party may be liable for damages beyond the specified limit in such cases. This is crucial for third-party claims, as it ensures that victims of fraud or misconduct can seek full recovery without being constrained by the liability cap.

In summary, the clauses you provided ensure that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct (like fraud or gross negligence) in the context of third-party claims.

Here's how it relates to your query about third-party claim indemnity in the context of fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct:

1. **Indemnity for Third-Party Claims**: The clause explicitly states that it pertains to obligations to indemnify a party for claims made by third parties. This means that if a third party brings a claim against one of the parties to the agreement, the indemnification obligations outlined elsewhere in the contract would still apply, regardless of the limitations on liability stated in this clause.

2. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause limits liability for consequential, incidental, indirect, or special damages, as well as punitive damages, arising from the agreement. This limitation is important because it clarifies that, while parties may be indemnified for third-party claims, they are not liable for certain types of damages that could arise from their actions or failures under the agreement, even if those actions involve negligence or other faults.

3. **Scope of Liability**: The clause indicates that the waiver of liability applies even in cases of negligence, strict liability, or other faults. However, it does not negate the obligation to indemnify for third-party claims, which may include claims arising from fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if a third party claims damages due to the actions of one party that involve fraud or willful misconduct, the indemnification obligations would still be enforceable.

4. **Legal Protection**: By including this clause, the parties are attempting to protect themselves from extensive liability while still acknowledging that they may need to indemnify each other for specific claims made by third parties. This is particularly relevant in cases where one party's actions (potentially involving fraud or negligence) lead to a claim from an external party.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable to the other for certain types of damages (special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages) in the event of a claim. This limitation is significant because it sets the boundaries for what damages can be pursued in the event of a dispute.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that it does not limit a party's indemnification obligations. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for losses arising from a third-party claim, the limitation of liability does not apply to those indemnification obligations. Therefore, if a third party brings a claim against one party due to the other party's fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, the indemnifying party may still be liable for those damages, regardless of the limitations set forth in this clause.

3. **Third Party Claims**: The clause mentions that the limitation of liability does not apply to damages awarded to a third party under a third-party claim. This is crucial because it indicates that if a third party successfully claims damages due to the actions of one of the parties (potentially involving fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct), the party responsible for those actions may still be liable for those damages, even if they would otherwise be protected by the limitation of liability.

In summary, while the clause limits the types of damages that can be claimed between the parties, it preserves the right to indemnification for third-party claims, particularly in cases involving serious misconduct such as fraud or negligence. This ensures that parties cannot escape liability for their wrongful actions that cause harm to others outside the contract.",5

Here’s how it relates to your query about third-party claim indemnity limited to the use of products in compliance with the agreement:

1. **Accuray Indemnity (Section 10.1)**: This section specifies that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor against third-party claims that a product infringes on intellectual property rights (patents, copyrights, trade secrets). The key point here is that this indemnity applies to claims based on the use of the product as provided by Accuray, which implies that the Distributor must use the product in accordance with the terms of the agreement for this indemnity to be applicable.

2. **Products Liability Indemnity (Section 10.2)**: This section further emphasizes that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor for claims that a product is unsafe when used according to Accuray's written specifications for its intended use. Again, this indicates that the indemnity is contingent upon the Distributor using the product as specified in the agreement.

3. **Distributor Indemnity (Section 10.6)**: Conversely, this section outlines the Distributor's obligation to indemnify Accuray for claims arising from the Distributor's acts or omissions that are not in accordance with the agreement. This reinforces the idea that compliance with the agreement is crucial; if the Distributor fails to comply, they may be liable for third-party claims.

4. **Limitation of Liability (Section 11.3)**: This section caps the liability of either party for claims related to breaches of the agreement, which includes third-party claims. It highlights that the total liability is limited to the amounts paid for products in the preceding twelve months, which indirectly emphasizes the importance of compliance with the agreement to avoid significant financial exposure.

In summary, the indemnity clauses in the agreement are directly relevant to your query as they establish that the indemnification for third-party claims is contingent upon the Distributor's compliance with the terms of the agreement. If the Distributor uses the products in a manner that is not compliant with the agreement, they may not be entitled to indemnification from Accuray for related third-party claims.",5

It is particularly relevant to your query about limiting third-party claim indemnity to the use of products in compliance with the agreement for the following reasons:

1. **Accuray Indemnity (Section 10.1)**: This section specifies that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor against third-party claims related to intellectual property infringement (patents, copyrights, trade secrets) as long as the claims arise from the use of the products provided by Accuray under the agreement. This implies that the indemnity is contingent upon the Distributor using the products in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If the Distributor uses the products in a manner that does not comply with the agreement, Accuray may not be liable for indemnification.

2. **Products Liability Indemnity (Section 10.2)**: Similar to the first section, this part states that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor for claims that a product is unsafe, but only when the product is used according to Accuray's written specifications for its intended use. This further emphasizes that the indemnity is limited to situations where the Distributor adheres to the agreed-upon usage guidelines.

3. **Distributor Indemnity (Section 10.6)**: This section outlines the Distributor's obligations to indemnify Accuray for claims arising from the Distributor's actions that are not in accordance with the agreement. This means that if the Distributor fails to comply with the terms of the agreement, they may be held liable for any resulting claims, reinforcing the idea that compliance with the agreement is crucial for indemnity protections.

In summary, the clause establishes that indemnity for third-party claims is closely tied to the compliance of both parties with the terms of the agreement. If either party deviates from the agreed-upon terms, their indemnity obligations may be limited or voided, which directly addresses your query about limiting third-party claim indemnity to the use of products in compliance with the agreement.",5

It is particularly relevant to your query about limiting third-party claim indemnity to the use of products in compliance with the agreement for the following reasons:

1. **Scope of Indemnity**: The clause specifies that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor for third-party claims related to the Products provided under the agreement, but only to the extent that these claims arise from the Products being used in accordance with Accuray's written specifications. This aligns with your query about limiting indemnity to compliant use.

2. **Conditions for Indemnity**: Both sections (10.1 and 10.2) outline specific conditions that must be met for the indemnity to apply. For instance, the Distributor must provide prompt notice of any claims, allow Accuray to control the defense, and provide reasonable assistance. This ensures that the indemnity is only applicable when the Distributor adheres to the terms of the agreement, reinforcing the idea of compliance.

3. **Distributor's Indemnity**: Section 10.6 introduces the Distributor's indemnity obligations, which state that the Distributor must indemnify Accuray for claims arising from acts or omissions not in accordance with the agreement. This further emphasizes the importance of compliance, as any deviation from the agreement could result in the Distributor being liable for indemnity.

4. **Limitations on Liability**: The indemnity clauses inherently limit liability to situations where the Products are used as intended and in compliance with the agreement. If the Distributor or any third party uses the Products outside of these parameters, the indemnity protections may not apply.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a framework for indemnity that is contingent upon the proper use of the Products in accordance with the agreement, thereby limiting liability for third-party claims to those situations where compliance is maintained.",5

This indicates that the indemnity is limited to claims that arise from the Products as they are supplied and used in accordance with the agreement.

2. **Exclusions from Indemnity**: The clause explicitly states that the indemnity does not cover claims that arise from certain actions, including:
   - Modifications made to the Product by parties other than the Supplier.
   - The combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials, or devices unless approved by the Supplier.
   - Fault attributable to the Company.

3. **Mutual Indemnification**: The clause also includes a reciprocal indemnification obligation where the Company must indemnify the Suppliers for claims arising from the Products, but again, only under specific conditions. This mutuality reinforces the idea that indemnity is contingent upon compliance with the terms of the agreement.

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Indemnification Responsibilities**: The clause outlines the indemnification obligations of both the Suppliers and the Company concerning third-party claims. Each party is required to defend, indemnify, and hold the other harmless from claims arising from specific circumstances related to the products supplied.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: The indemnity provided by the Suppliers (Section 8.1) is specifically limited to claims arising from:
   - Allegations that a product infringes or misappropriates intellectual property rights.
   - Claims arising from manufacturing defects under products liability theory.

   Importantly, the indemnity does **not** cover claims that arise from:
   - Modifications made to the product by parties other than the Supplier.
   - The combination or use of the product with other products, processes, methods, materials, or devices unless approved by the Supplier.
   - Fault attributable to the Company.

   This limitation directly addresses your query about the use of products in compliance with the agreement. If a product is used in a manner not compliant with the agreement (e.g., modified or combined with unapproved products), the Supplier is not liable for indemnification.

3. **Company's Indemnification**: Similarly, Section 8.2 outlines the Company's indemnification obligations, which also exclude claims arising from modifications or combinations made by parties other than the Company. This reinforces the idea that compliance with the agreement is crucial for indemnity protection.

4. **Limited Liability**: Article 9 further limits liability for both parties, emphasizing that indemnity obligations described in Article 8 are exceptions to the general limitations on liability. This means that while there are caps on liability for other types of claims, indemnity obligations related to third-party claims are treated differently and are not subject to the same limitations.

2. **Specificity**: The clause specifically mentions ""any violation of applicable laws or regulations"" as one of the grounds for indemnification. This means that if the Indemnifying Party engages in conduct that violates laws or regulations, they are obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any resulting claims, costs, or damages.

3. **Protection for the Indemnified Party**: By including this provision, the clause provides a layer of protection for the Indemnified Party, ensuring that they are not held liable for issues that arise due to the Indemnifying Party's unlawful actions.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The clause is comprehensive, covering not only violations of law but also other forms of misconduct, such as negligence, breaches of contract, and intellectual property infringements.

2. **Failure to Perform or Breach**: The first sub-clause (12.1(a)) refers to claims arising from a failure to perform or a breach of any obligation, warranty, representation, or covenant in the agreement. If a party's actions or omissions constitute a violation of applicable laws or regulations, this could be interpreted as a breach of the contract, triggering the indemnification obligation.

3. **Personal Injury or Property Damage**: The second sub-clause (12.1(b)) addresses claims of personal injury or property damage due to the fault or negligence of the Indemnitor. If such injuries or damages result from a violation of law (e.g., safety regulations), the Indemnitor may still be liable for indemnification.

4. **Infringement Claims**: The third sub-clause (12.1(c)) deals with claims of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights. If a violation of law involves intellectual property (e.g., copyright infringement), this clause would also apply.

2. **Breach of Obligations**: Subsection (a) specifically mentions indemnification for claims arising from a breach of any obligation, warranty, representation, or covenant in the agreement.

3. **Negligence and Fault**: Subsection (b) addresses claims related to personal injury or property damage arising from the fault or negligence of the Indemnitor. If a violation of law results in such damages, the Indemnitor may be held liable, and the indemnification clause would apply.

4. **Intellectual Property Claims**: Subsection (c) deals with claims of infringement or misappropriation of third-party rights. While this is more specific to intellectual property, it illustrates the clause's intent to cover various legal claims, which could include those arising from violations of laws related to intellectual property.

The Parties shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other, their heirs, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, expenses, causes of action, suits, claims, and judgments of any kind or character for injury to person or property arising in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT, whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise.","The indemnification clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding indemnification that covers violations of law because it establishes a framework for one party to protect the other from various legal liabilities, including those arising from violations of laws or regulations.

Here's how the clause relates to the query:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause states that the parties will indemnify each other against ""any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney's fees, expenses, causes of action, suits, claims, and judgments."" This broad language encompasses a wide range of potential legal issues, including those that may arise from violations of law.

2. **Responsibility for Actions**: The clause specifies that indemnification applies to losses arising ""in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT."" If one party's actions or failures to comply with legal obligations lead to a claim or lawsuit, the other party can seek indemnification under this clause.

3. **Negligence and Other Causes**: The clause explicitly mentions that indemnification applies ""whether due to the negligence of a Party or otherwise."" This means that even if a violation of law occurs without negligence, the indemnifying party may still be responsible for covering the resulting liabilities.

4. **Protection Against Legal Claims**: By including indemnification for claims and judgments, the clause provides a mechanism for one party to seek protection against legal actions that may arise from the other party's conduct, including violations of applicable laws.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to the query as it provides a legal safeguard for the parties involved against potential liabilities, including those stemming from violations of law, thereby ensuring that one party can seek compensation or defense from the other in such situations.",4

12.1 Each Party (""""Indemnitor"""") will defend, indemnify and hold the other Party (including associated officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and affiliates) (cumulatively, """"Indemnitee"""") harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees), suffered or incurred as a result of or in connection with any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding brought against Indemnitee based upon (a) a claim of a failure to perform, or a breach by Indemnitor of, any obligation, warranty, representation or covenant in this Agreement; (b) a claim of personal injury or property damage arising out of the fault or negligence of Indemnitor, its representatives, agents, or employees; or (c) a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right held by any third party.

In relation to your query about indemnification that covers violations of law, the clause is relevant in the following ways:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: Section 12.1 specifies that the Indemnitor will indemnify the Indemnitee against losses, damages, claims, liabilities, and expenses arising from various types of claims. While it does not explicitly mention violations of law, it does cover claims related to breaches of obligations, warranties, representations, or covenants in the agreement. If a violation of law is tied to a breach of the agreement, the indemnification could apply.

2. **Claims of Breach**: The first part of Section 12.1 (subsection (a)) addresses claims arising from a failure to perform or a breach of the agreement. If a party's actions or omissions result in a legal violation that constitutes a breach of the agreement, the Indemnitor would be responsible for indemnifying the Indemnitee.

3. **Personal Injury and Property Damage**: Subsection (b) covers claims of personal injury or property damage arising from the fault or negligence of the Indemnitor. If a violation of law leads to such claims, the Indemnitor would also be liable for indemnification.

4. **Intellectual Property Claims**: Subsection (c) addresses claims of infringement or misappropriation of third-party rights. If a violation of law involves intellectual property issues, this clause would also provide indemnification.

5. **Exclusions**: Section 12.2 clarifies that, except for claims made under Section 12.1, neither party will be liable for indirect or consequential damages. This means that while direct claims related to violations of law may be covered under the indemnification clause, indirect consequences resulting from such violations would not be indemnified.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly mention violations of law, it provides a framework for indemnification that could encompass such violations if they relate to breaches of the agreement or result in claims for personal injury, property damage, or intellectual property infringement. Therefore, it is relevant to your query regarding indemnification for violations of law.",4

Seller must defend Buyer in any actions or legal proceedings arising out of Claims with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. This indemnification obligation will survive Seller’s delivery of Goods or furnishing of Services to Buyer. The amount of Seller’s insurance in no way limits Seller’s indemnification obligations. Mutual indemnification on food especially – limitation of liability","The clause you provided is a seller-favorable indemnification clause, which is relevant to your query in several ways:

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause explicitly states that the Seller agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Buyer from a wide range of claims, including bodily injury, property damage, and other liabilities related to the goods sold or services performed. This is favorable to the Seller because it places the burden of liability primarily on the Seller, protecting the Buyer from potential losses.

2. **Exclusions for Buyer’s Actions**: The clause includes exceptions where the Seller is not liable for indemnification, specifically if the claims arise from the Buyer’s gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or improper handling of goods. This limitation is beneficial for the Seller, as it reduces their exposure to liability in situations where the Buyer may be at fault.

3. **Defense Obligation**: The Seller is required to defend the Buyer in any legal actions arising from the claims, which further emphasizes the Seller's responsibility for any issues related to the goods or services. This is a strong seller-favorable position, as it ensures that the Seller bears the costs of legal defense.

4. **Survival of Obligation**: The clause states that the indemnification obligation survives the delivery of goods or services, meaning that the Seller's responsibilities do not end upon completion of the transaction. This provides ongoing protection for the Buyer, which is a favorable aspect for the Seller as it reinforces their commitment to liability.

5. **Insurance Limitation**: The clause notes that the amount of the Seller's insurance does not limit their indemnification obligations. This is significant because it ensures that the Seller cannot escape their indemnification responsibilities by merely having insurance coverage, thus reinforcing the Seller's liability.

6. **Mutual Indemnification**: The mention of mutual indemnification, particularly in the context of food, suggests that there may be shared responsibilities, but the clause primarily emphasizes the Seller's obligations. This can be seen as a way to balance interests while still favoring the Seller in terms of liability.

Overall, this clause is structured to provide strong indemnification protections for the Buyer while limiting the Seller's liability in specific circumstances, making it a seller-favorable indemnification clause.",5

GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these General Terms and Conditions or in any contract of which these General Terms and Conditions are a part, each Party will bear full responsibility, without limit, and in no event will be required to indemnify the other for, any gross negligence or willful misconduct attributable to its managerial or senior supervisory personnel.","The indemnification clause provided in your query outlines the responsibilities of both the Buyer and the Seller regarding indemnification for losses, damages, costs, or expenses arising from wrongful or negligent acts or omissions. However, it is structured in a way that is not particularly favorable to the Seller, which is the focus of your query regarding seller-favorable indemnification clauses.

### Key Points of the Clause:

1. **Mutual Indemnification**: The clause includes mutual indemnification obligations, meaning both parties (Buyer and Seller) agree to indemnify each other for losses arising from their respective wrongful or negligent acts. This mutuality can be seen as a balanced approach, but it does not favor the Seller.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The indemnification covers losses incurred by either party due to the actions of their employees, officers, directors, or agents. This broad scope means that both parties are exposed to potential liabilities, which may not be ideal for the Seller.

3. **Exclusion of Gross Negligence and Willful Misconduct**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will indemnify the other for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This provision limits the indemnification obligations, but it applies equally to both parties, again not favoring the Seller.

### Seller-Favorable Indemnification Clauses:

To create a seller-favorable indemnification clause, the following adjustments could be made:

- **Limit Indemnification Obligations**: The Seller could seek to limit its indemnification obligations to only specific circumstances or to exclude certain types of claims, such as those arising from the Buyer’s negligence or misconduct.

- **Broaden Indemnification for Seller**: The clause could be revised to provide broader indemnification for the Seller, ensuring that the Buyer is responsible for a wider range of liabilities, particularly those that may arise from the Buyer’s actions.

- **Cap on Indemnification**: The Seller could negotiate a cap on the indemnification amount that the Buyer would be liable for, thereby limiting the Seller's exposure.

- **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**: The clause could include specific provisions for indemnification related to third-party claims, which could provide additional protection for the Seller.

In summary, the current clause is balanced and does not favor the Seller. To make it more seller-favorable, the indemnification obligations could be adjusted to limit the Seller's exposure and increase the Buyer's responsibilities.",5

The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the relevant Supplier, (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the relevant Supplier, or (iii) the fault of the Company.

Here's how it relates to seller-favorable indemnification clauses:

1. **Supplier's Indemnification Obligations**: 
   - The clause in Section 8.1 places a significant burden on the Suppliers, requiring them to indemnify the Company for claims related to intellectual property infringement and product liability. This is favorable to the Company (the buyer) because it shifts the risk of these claims onto the Suppliers. The Suppliers must defend, indemnify, and hold the Company harmless, which means they are responsible for any legal costs, settlements, or judgments that arise from these claims.

2. **Limitations on Indemnification**: 
   - The clause also specifies certain exclusions where the Suppliers are not liable for indemnification, such as claims arising from modifications made by parties other than the Supplier or the Company's fault. While this provides some protection to the Suppliers, it still places a substantial risk on them for claims that could arise from their products.

3. **Company's Indemnification Obligations**: 
   - Section 8.2 outlines the Company's obligations to indemnify the Suppliers, but it is limited to claims that are not covered by the Suppliers' indemnification obligations. This means that the Company is not taking on as much risk as the Suppliers, which is a seller-favorable aspect for the Company.

4. **Overall Risk Allocation**: 
   - The overall structure of the indemnification clause favors the Company by placing the primary responsibility for indemnification on the Suppliers. This is a common feature in seller-favorable indemnification clauses, where the seller (in this case, the Suppliers) bears the risk of certain claims, while the buyer (the Company) has limited exposure.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to the query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable indemnification structure, where the Suppliers are heavily burdened with the responsibility to indemnify the Company for specific claims, thereby protecting the Company from potential liabilities associated with the Products they purchase.",5

Here’s how it relates to the query:

1. **Indemnification by Suppliers (Section 8.1)**: This section requires Suppliers to indemnify the Company against third-party claims related to product infringement and manufacturing defects. This is a seller-favorable clause because it places the burden of defense and liability primarily on the Suppliers for issues arising from their products. The Suppliers are responsible for legal costs, settlements, and any judgments, which can be significant financial liabilities.

2. **Exclusions from Indemnification**: The clause also specifies exclusions where the Suppliers are not liable for indemnification, such as modifications made by parties other than the Supplier or the Company’s fault. This limitation protects the Suppliers from being held responsible for claims that arise from actions outside their control, which is favorable for them.

3. **Indemnification by the Company (Section 8.2)**: While the Company also has indemnification obligations, they are limited to claims not covered by the Suppliers' indemnification. This creates a balance but still places a significant amount of liability on the Suppliers, making it more favorable for the Company in terms of risk management.

4. **Limited Liability (Section 9)**: This section further limits the liability of both parties, particularly the Company, by capping the cumulative liability to the amounts actually paid for the products in the twelve months prior to the claim. This limitation can be seen as favorable to the Company, as it reduces potential financial exposure.

In summary, the indemnification clauses in this agreement are structured in a way that favors the seller (the Company) by placing significant indemnification responsibilities on the Suppliers while also limiting the Company's overall liability. This balance of risk and responsibility is a key aspect of seller-favorable indemnification clauses.",5

In the context of your query regarding seller-favorable indemnification clauses, this clause does not align with that perspective. Here’s an analysis of the clause in relation to your query:

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause places the burden of indemnification on the supplier, meaning that the supplier is responsible for covering any liabilities incurred by the distributor due to defects in the products. This is typically more favorable to the distributor, as it protects them from financial loss related to product defects.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The indemnification covers a broad range of liabilities, including damage to property, death, or personal injury. This extensive coverage is advantageous for the distributor, as it ensures they are protected against significant claims that could arise from the use of the supplier's products.

3. **Exclusion of Wilful Misconduct**: The clause does include a limitation where the supplier is not liable for indemnification if the liability arises from the wilful misconduct of the distributor. However, this is a common limitation in indemnification clauses and does not significantly shift the balance in favor of the supplier.

4. **Insurance Requirement**: The requirement for the supplier to add the distributor to their insurance certificate further enhances the distributor's protection, ensuring that there is insurance coverage available for claims that may arise.

In summary, this clause is not seller-favorable; rather, it is structured to protect the distributor from liabilities associated with the supplier's products.

1. **Broad Indemnification**: The clause requires the Seller to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Buyer from a wide range of claims, including those related to bodily injury, personal injury, property damage, and other liabilities arising from the Goods sold or Services performed. This broad scope is favorable to the Buyer as it provides extensive protection against potential legal issues.

2. **Exclusions Favoring the Buyer**: The indemnification obligation is limited only in cases where the claims arise from the Buyer’s gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or improper handling of the Goods. This means that the Seller is still responsible for indemnifying the Buyer in most situations, which is advantageous for the Buyer.

3. **Defense Obligation**: The Seller is required to defend the Buyer in any legal actions related to the claims, using counsel that is satisfactory to the Buyer. This provision ensures that the Buyer is not only protected from claims but also has the Seller bear the costs of legal defense, which is a significant benefit.

4. **Survival of Obligation**: The clause states that the indemnification obligation survives the delivery of Goods or Services. This means that the Buyer continues to have protection even after the transaction is completed, which is favorable for long-term risk management.

5. **Insurance Limitation**: The clause specifies that the amount of the Seller’s insurance does not limit their indemnification obligations. This is particularly beneficial for the Buyer, as it ensures that the Seller cannot escape their responsibilities by merely having a certain level of insurance coverage.

6. **Mutual Indemnification**: The mention of mutual indemnification, especially in the context of food, suggests that both parties may have some level of responsibility, but the clause primarily emphasizes the Seller's obligations to protect the Buyer, which is a buyer-favorable aspect.

However, it is structured in a way that may not be particularly favorable to the Buyer, as it places significant indemnification obligations on the Buyer while also providing a reciprocal obligation for the Seller.

Here’s how the clause relates to the concept of buyer-favorable indemnification clauses:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause requires the Buyer to indemnify the Seller for losses arising from the Buyer's actions, which can be seen as a burden on the Buyer. A buyer-favorable indemnification clause would typically limit the Buyer's indemnification obligations or shift more risk to the Seller.

2. **Reciprocal Indemnification**: While the clause does provide for mutual indemnification (both parties indemnifying each other), the language does not inherently favor the Buyer. A more buyer-favorable clause might include broader protections for the Buyer, such as limiting the Buyer's indemnification to specific circumstances or capping the indemnification amount.

3. **Exclusions for Gross Negligence and Willful Misconduct**: The clause states that neither party will indemnify the other for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is a standard provision, but it does not specifically favor the Buyer. A buyer-favorable clause might include additional protections or carve-outs that would shield the Buyer from liability in more scenarios.

4. **Legal Fees**: The clause mentions that indemnification includes reasonable attorney fees, which is a positive aspect for the Buyer. However, the overall balance of risk and responsibility still leans towards the Seller, as the Buyer is responsible for indemnifying the Seller for a broader range of actions.

In summary, while the clause does provide some mutual indemnification, it does not strongly favor the Buyer. A buyer-favorable indemnification clause would typically limit the Buyer's exposure, provide clearer definitions of indemnifiable events, and potentially include caps on liability or exclusions that protect the Buyer from certain risks.",4

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS ARTICLE 9 IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BARGAIN AND ABSENT THIS ARTICLE 9 THE ECONOMIC AND OTHER TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT.","The indemnification clauses in the provided contract are relevant to the query about buyer-favorable indemnification clauses because they outline the responsibilities and protections afforded to the parties involved, particularly in relation to third-party claims. Here’s how these clauses can be interpreted in the context of being buyer-favorable:

1. **Supplier Indemnification (Section 8.1)**: This section requires the Suppliers to indemnify the Company against third-party claims related to intellectual property infringement and product liability due to manufacturing defects. This is favorable to the buyer (the Company) because it shifts the risk of these significant liabilities onto the Suppliers. The Company is protected from having to bear the costs associated with defending against such claims, which can be substantial.

2. **Company Indemnification (Section 8.2)**: While this section also provides indemnification from the Company to the Suppliers, it is limited to claims that are not covered by the Suppliers' indemnification obligations. This means that the Suppliers are primarily responsible for indemnifying the Company, which is advantageous for the buyer. The Company is only liable for claims that do not fall under the Suppliers' responsibilities, thus limiting its exposure.

3. **Exclusions from Indemnification**: Both indemnification sections include exclusions for claims arising from modifications made by parties other than the Suppliers or the Company, or from the fault of the Company. While these exclusions are standard, they still emphasize the importance of the Suppliers' responsibility for the products they provide, reinforcing the buyer's protection.

4. **Limited Liability (Section 9)**: This section limits the liability of the parties, which can be seen as a protective measure for the Suppliers. However, it also ensures that the Company is not liable for indirect or consequential damages, which is favorable for the buyer as it limits potential financial exposure.

In summary, the indemnification clauses in this contract are structured to provide significant protection to the buyer (the Company) by placing the burden of indemnification primarily on the Suppliers for key risks associated with the products. This aligns with the concept of buyer-favorable indemnification clauses, as it minimizes the buyer's liability and exposure to third-party claims.",5

10.1. Accuray Indemnity.

Accuray will not be bound by any settlement or compromise that Distributor enters into without Accuray's express prior written consent.
10.2. Products Liability Indemnity.

Here’s how each part of the clause relates to the concept of indemnification and its favorability to the buyer (Distributor in this case):

1. **Accuray Indemnity (Section 10.1)**: This section outlines that Accuray (the seller) will indemnify and hold the Distributor (the buyer) harmless from any third-party claims related to intellectual property infringement. This is favorable to the buyer because it protects them from legal liabilities that could arise from using the products provided by Accuray. The buyer is not responsible for defending against these claims, as Accuray assumes that responsibility.

2. **Products Liability Indemnity (Section 10.2)**: Similar to the first section, this provision states that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor against claims that the products are unsafe when used according to Accuray's specifications. This is particularly favorable for the buyer, as it ensures that they are protected from potential lawsuits related to product safety, which could be financially devastating.

3. **Distributor Indemnity (Section 10.6)**: While this section outlines the Distributor's obligation to indemnify Accuray for certain claims, it is still important to note that the indemnification is limited to specific circumstances (e.g., acts or omissions not in accordance with the agreement). This creates a balance in the indemnification obligations, but the overall structure still favors the buyer since the majority of the indemnity obligations fall on Accuray.

4. **Limitation of Liability (Section 11.3)**: This section caps the liability of either party to the amount paid by the Distributor for products in the preceding twelve months, which can be seen as a buyer-favorable term. It limits the financial exposure of the Distributor in case of claims, ensuring that they are not liable for amounts that exceed their recent purchases.

5. **Exclusions from Liability**: The clause also specifies that neither party will be liable for special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or tort damages, which protects the buyer from potentially unlimited liability in certain situations. This is favorable for the buyer as it provides a level of predictability regarding potential financial exposure.

In summary, the indemnification clauses in this agreement are structured to provide significant protections to the buyer (Distributor) against various risks associated with the products provided by Accuray. This aligns with the concept of buyer-favorable indemnification clauses, as they shift the burden of liability and legal defense to the seller (Accuray) in key areas, thereby safeguarding the buyer's interests.",5

NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS MADE REGARDING SUCH INFORMATION AND MATERIAL, OR ITS COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
11.03 Indirect or Enhanced Damages. In no event will either Party be liable to the other Party under this Agreement for any consequential, indirect, special, incidental, punitive or exemplary loss or damage, including, without limitation, business interruption, cost of capital, loss of anticipated revenues and profits, loss of goodwill or increased operating costs, whether arising from contract, warranty, tort, strict liability or otherwise regardless of whether the possibility of such losses or damages have been made known to the first Party, and each Party hereby expressly waives all such rights and remedies, except for breach of any confidentiality or restricted use provisions of this Agreement and except as provided in Paragraph 11.04 (Exceptions to Limitations of Liability).
11.04 Exceptions to Limitations of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party will bear full responsibility, without limit, for the following:
(i) Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct attributable to its personnel, and, in no event, will a Party be required to release or indemnify the other Party for Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct attributable to the other Party; and
(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","The clause you provided contains specific provisions regarding the disclaimer of indirect damages, which is directly relevant to your query. Here’s how it relates:

1. **Limitation of Liability for Indirect Damages**: Section 11.03 explicitly states that neither party will be liable to the other for any consequential, indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or exemplary damages. This includes losses such as business interruption, loss of anticipated revenues, and increased operating costs. By including this language, the parties are effectively disclaiming liability for indirect damages that may arise from the use of the information and materials provided under the agreement.

2. **Waiver of Rights**: The clause further emphasizes that each party expressly waives all rights and remedies related to these types of damages. This means that even if a party suffers indirect damages, they cannot seek compensation from the other party under the terms of this agreement.

3. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**: While the clause provides a broad disclaimer of indirect damages, it also outlines exceptions in Section 11.04. Specifically, it states that liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct is not limited, and legal obligations to third parties are also not affected. This means that while indirect damages are generally disclaimed, there are certain serious breaches (like gross negligence) that would still allow for liability.

4. **Overall Purpose**: The purpose of including such disclaimers in contracts is to protect parties from unforeseen and potentially significant financial liabilities that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions or omissions. This is particularly important in agreements involving the sharing of information and materials, where the receiving party is responsible for determining how to use that information.

In summary, the clause serves to limit liability for indirect damages, thereby protecting both parties from claims that could arise from unforeseen consequences of their actions, while also specifying certain exceptions where liability may still apply.",5

Here’s how it relates:

1. **Scope of Disclaimer**: The clause explicitly states that neither party (nor their affiliates, officers, directors, or employees) shall be liable for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that are not direct or immediate as a result of the other party's actions or failures, they cannot seek compensation for those losses under this agreement.

2. **Broad Coverage**: The disclaimer covers a wide range of potential claims, including those based on contract, tort (including negligence), or breach of statutory duty. This broad language ensures that the parties are protected from a variety of claims that could arise from indirect damages.

3. **Foreseeability and Notification**: The clause also notes that this limitation applies even if the damages were foreseeable or if one party had been advised of the possibility of such losses. This reinforces the strength of the disclaimer, as it limits liability regardless of the circumstances surrounding the damages.

4. **Exceptions**: Importantly, the clause outlines exceptions to this disclaimer. It states that the limitation of liability does not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, nor does it limit the amounts payable to third parties under indemnities specified in other sections of the agreement. This means that while indirect damages are generally disclaimed, there are specific situations where liability may still be applicable.

In summary, this clause serves to protect both parties from claims related to indirect damages, thereby limiting their potential financial exposure under the agreement. It is a common provision in contracts to manage risk and clarify the extent of liability.",5

Here's how it relates:

1. **Scope of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for certain types of damages, specifically consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or enhanced damages. This means that if one party breaches the agreement, the other party cannot claim these types of damages as a result of that breach.

2. **Types of Damages Excluded**: The clause lists specific categories of damages that are excluded from liability. This includes lost profits or revenues and diminution in value, which are often considered indirect damages because they do not arise directly from the breach itself but rather as a secondary effect.

3. **Foreseeability and Notification**: The clause further clarifies that the exclusion of liability for these damages applies regardless of whether the damages were foreseeable, whether the party was advised of the possibility of such damages, or the legal theory upon which the claim is based. This broadens the protection against liability for indirect damages, making it clear that even if a party could have anticipated the damages or was warned about them, they still cannot hold the other party liable.

4. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause includes a specific exception for indemnification obligations related to claims by third parties. This means that while the parties are generally not liable for indirect damages to each other, they may still have obligations to indemnify each other in certain circumstances involving third-party claims.

In summary, this clause serves to limit the liability of the parties in the event of a breach of the agreement, specifically by excluding claims for indirect damages, which is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from extensive financial exposure.",5

Here's how it relates to the query about the disclaimer of indirect damages:

1. **Scope of Disclaimer**: The clause explicitly states that neither party (LBIO nor MD Anderson) will be liable for ""special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential damages."" This includes damages that are not directly caused by a breach of the agreement but may arise as a secondary effect, such as loss of opportunity, loss of use, or loss of revenue or profit. This is a common legal practice to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable damages that could arise from indirect consequences of a breach.

2. **Exclusions from Disclaimer**: The clause also outlines specific exceptions where this disclaimer does not apply. These exceptions include:
   - Indemnification obligations, which are commitments to compensate for certain damages or losses.
   - Breaches related to confidentiality, non-use, or intellectual property matters, which are often considered critical and may warrant liability despite the general disclaimer.
   - Cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, where a party's actions are so egregious that they should not be shielded from liability.

3. **Legal Protection**: By including this disclaimer, the parties are seeking to protect themselves from claims for indirect damages that could arise from the agreement. This is particularly important in contracts where the potential for indirect damages can be significant and difficult to quantify.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it serves to limit liability for indirect damages, thereby providing legal protection to the parties involved while also specifying the circumstances under which such a disclaimer does not apply.",5

This includes damages for loss of profit, revenue, business, or data. The clause emphasizes that even if a party has been advised of the possibility of such damages, they will not be held liable. This is a clear disclaimer of indirect damages, which protects both parties from claims that could arise from unforeseen or secondary effects of a breach or failure to perform under the contract.

2. **Limitation of Damages (Section 8.3)**: This section further limits the liability of the parties by stating that, except for liabilities under the indemnity section, neither party's aggregate liability will exceed a specified amount. This limitation reinforces the disclaimer of indirect damages by capping the total potential liability, thereby reducing the risk of significant financial exposure from indirect claims.

In summary, the clause is relevant to the query about the disclaimer of indirect damages because it clearly outlines the limitations on liability for such damages, thereby protecting the parties from extensive claims that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions or failures under the agreement.",5

Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The clause you provided is relevant to the query about a consequential damages waiver because it addresses the limitation of certain types of damages that can be claimed by the parties involved in the agreement. Specifically, this clause is a waiver of non-compensatory damages, which includes punitive or exemplary damages.

Here's how it relates to the concept of consequential damages:

1. **Definition of Consequential Damages**: Consequential damages are losses that do not flow directly from a breach of contract but are a secondary result of the breach. They often include lost profits or other indirect losses that a party may suffer as a result of the other party's failure to perform under the contract.

2. **Waiver of Damages**: The clause explicitly states that both parties waive their rights to claim punitive or exemplary damages. While this clause does not specifically mention consequential damages, it indicates a broader intent to limit the types of damages that can be pursued in the event of a dispute. This can be interpreted as a general approach to limiting liability, which often includes consequential damages.

3. **Acknowledgment of Adequate Remedies**: The clause also emphasizes that the parties acknowledge that the remedies provided in the agreement, as well as other legal or equitable remedies, are sufficient. This suggests that the parties have agreed to limit their potential recovery to those remedies and have chosen not to pursue additional claims for consequential damages.

4. **Experience and Understanding**: The clause notes that both parties are experienced in negotiating such agreements and have had legal counsel. This reinforces the idea that they fully understand the implications of waiving certain types of damages, including the potential for consequential damages.

In summary, while the clause specifically waives punitive and exemplary damages, it reflects a broader intent to limit liability and suggests that consequential damages may also be implicitly waived or restricted under the terms of the agreement. This is important for parties to understand, as it affects their potential recovery in the event of a breach.",4

For purposes of this waiver, economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service except personal injury or damage to other tangible property. Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.
9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination. Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.
9.7. Essential Elements. Customer and Metavante acknowledge and agree that the limitations contained in this Article 9 are essential to this Agreement, and that Metavante has expressly relied upon the inclusion of each and every provision of this Article 9 as a condition to executing this Agreement.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.2, is directly relevant to the query regarding a consequential damages waiver.

1. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**: Section 9.2 explicitly states that neither party will be liable to the other for incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages. This includes lost profits, loss of business, or other economic damages that may arise from a breach of the agreement. By including this language, the parties are waiving their rights to claim consequential damages against each other, which is a key aspect of a consequential damages waiver.

2. **Scope of Waiver**: The clause clarifies that this waiver applies regardless of the nature of the claim (contract, tort, etc.) and even if the party allegedly liable was aware of the possibility of such damages. This broad scope reinforces the waiver's strength, ensuring that both parties understand that they cannot seek compensation for these types of damages.

3. **Severability**: The clause states that the exclusion of consequential damages is independent and severable from other provisions of the agreement. This means that even if other parts of the agreement are found to be unenforceable, the waiver of consequential damages remains in effect.

4. **Legal Implications**: By including this waiver, the parties are limiting their potential liability and exposure to claims that could arise from the agreement. This is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from unpredictable and potentially significant financial losses.

5. **Essential Elements**: Section 9.7 emphasizes that the limitations on liability, including the waiver of consequential damages, are essential to the agreement. This indicates that both parties have negotiated these terms and that they are a fundamental part of the contractual relationship.

In summary, this clause serves as a clear and comprehensive waiver of consequential damages, which is a critical aspect of risk management in contractual agreements. It protects both parties from claims that could arise from indirect or unforeseen consequences of a breach, thereby providing a level of certainty and predictability in their business relationship.",5

1. **Definition of Consequential Damages**: Consequential damages refer to losses that do not flow directly from an act but are a consequence of the initial act. These can include lost profits, loss of business opportunities, or other indirect losses that arise from a breach of contract.

2. **Scope of the Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. This means that if one party breaches the agreement, the other party cannot claim these types of damages as compensation.

3. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause includes a provision that allows for indemnification against claims from unaffiliated third parties. This means that while the parties waive their rights to claim consequential damages from each other, they still have obligations to defend and indemnify each other against claims made by third parties, which may include claims for consequential damages.

4. **Broad Applicability**: The waiver applies regardless of the circumstances, including negligence or fault of the party whose liability is being waived. This broad language reinforces the intent to limit liability for consequential damages under any condition.

5. **Legal Protection**: By including this waiver, the parties are protecting themselves from potentially significant financial exposure that could arise from indirect losses, which can often be difficult to quantify and prove.

This includes lost profits, loss of business, or other economic damages that may arise from a breach of the agreement. This is a clear waiver of consequential damages, which is a key aspect of limiting liability in contracts.

2. **Scope of Waiver**: The clause emphasizes that this waiver applies regardless of the nature of the claim (contract, tort, etc.) and even if the party allegedly liable was aware of the possibility of such damages. This broad scope reinforces the intent to limit liability and protect both parties from unforeseen economic losses that could arise from breaches.

This means that even if other parts of the contract are found to be unenforceable, the waiver of consequential damages remains in effect.

5. **Essential Elements**: The clause concludes by stating that the limitations in Article 9 are essential to the agreement, indicating that both parties have relied on these limitations when entering into the contract.

Here’s how it relates:

1. **Definition of Consequential Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for consequential damages, which are typically defined as indirect damages that do not flow directly from the breach of a contract but rather result from the consequences of the breach. This includes damages for loss of profit, revenue, business, or data.

2. **Scope of Waiver**: The waiver of consequential damages is broad, applying to all types of liability (contract, warranty, tort, etc.) and is applicable even if the party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This means that both parties agree to limit their liability for indirect losses, which can often be substantial.

3. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the waiver does not apply. For instance, if a party is liable to a third party and entitled to indemnification, or if there is a breach of confidentiality (nondisclosure), those situations are not covered by the waiver. This indicates that while the parties are waiving consequential damages in most scenarios, they still recognize certain circumstances where liability may arise.

4. **Limitation of Damages**: Following the waiver of consequential damages, the clause also includes a limitation of damages provision, which caps the total liability of either party to a specified amount (not disclosed in the excerpt). This further reinforces the intent to limit financial exposure arising from the agreement.

5. **Legal Implications**: Such waivers are common in contracts to protect parties from extensive liability and to encourage risk-taking in business transactions. However, they must be clearly stated to be enforceable, and the exceptions help ensure that critical liabilities are still addressed.

1. **Incidental Damages Disclaimer**: The clause specifically addresses the limitation of liability for both parties under the agreement. In Section 11.03, it states that neither party will be liable for ""consequential, indirect, special, incidental, punitive or exemplary loss or damage."" This is a clear disclaimer of liability for incidental damages, meaning that if either party suffers such damages as a result of the other party's actions or inactions, they cannot seek compensation for those damages under this agreement.

2. **Scope of Liability**: The clause emphasizes that the parties are waiving their rights to claim incidental damages, regardless of the circumstances that may lead to such damages. This includes losses related to business interruption, loss of profits, or increased operating costs. The waiver applies even if the possibility of such losses was known to the parties, reinforcing the intent to limit liability.

3. **Exceptions**: While the clause provides a broad disclaimer of incidental damages, it also outlines exceptions in Section 11.04. Specifically, it states that liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct is not limited, and legal obligations to third parties are also not affected. This means that while incidental damages are generally disclaimed, there are certain serious breaches or legal obligations that could still result in liability.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it explicitly disclaims liability for incidental damages, outlines the scope of that disclaimer, and provides exceptions where liability may still apply.

This is a common legal practice to limit the potential financial exposure of a party in a contract.

2. **Waiver of Rights**: The clause indicates that the participant (the other party in the contract) waives any rights to claim these types of damages. This means that even if the participant experiences losses that could be categorized as incidental or consequential, they cannot seek compensation for those losses from the Released Parties.

3. **Cumulative Liability Cap**: The clause also sets a cap on the cumulative liability of the sponsor to the participant, limiting it to the lesser of the participant's actual loss or $1,000. This further reinforces the limitation of liability and protects the Released Parties from extensive financial claims.

4. **Legal Compliance**: The clause notes that these disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

Here's how the clause addresses incidental damages:

1. **Scope of Disclaimer**: The clause clearly states that neither LBIO nor MD Anderson, nor their affiliates, will have any liability for ""incidental"" damages. This means that if any incidental damages occur as a result of the agreement or related activities, the parties cannot be held responsible for those damages.

2. **Types of Damages Covered**: The clause lists various types of damages that are disclaimed, including ""special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential damages."" Incidental damages typically refer to losses that are not directly caused by a breach but are a secondary result of the breach, such as costs incurred due to delays or other indirect effects.

3. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**: The clause also specifies exceptions where the disclaimer does not apply, such as indemnification obligations, breaches of confidentiality, intellectual property matters, and cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that if any of these exceptions occur, the parties may still be liable for incidental damages in those specific situations.

This means that if a participant suffers a loss of profits as a result of their involvement with the sponsor or the event, they cannot seek compensation for those lost profits.

2. **Waiver of Rights**: The clause indicates that the participant waives any rights to claim these types of damages, including lost profits, from Samsung and its licensors.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The disclaimer indicates that neither party is making any representations or warranties beyond what is explicitly stated in the agreement. This can imply that neither party is liable for any indirect or consequential damages, which often include lost profits. By acknowledging that no additional warranties are made, the parties are effectively limiting their liability for claims that could arise from lost profits.

2. **Exclusion of Certain Claims**: The clause suggests that if a party were to suffer lost profits as a result of reliance on any representations or warranties not included in the agreement, they may not have a valid claim for those lost profits. This is because the disclaimer serves to clarify that the parties are not responsible for any outcomes that arise from assumptions or expectations not explicitly covered in the agreement.

4. **Awareness of Potential Damages**: The clause notes that the disclaimer holds even if the party has been informed of the possibility of such damages. This is significant because it indicates that prior knowledge of potential lost profits does not create liability.

Here's a breakdown of how this clause relates to the disclaimer of lost profits:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause serves to limit the liability of both parties in the event of certain types of damages. By including lost profits in this limitation, the parties agree that they will not hold each other responsible for any loss of profits that may arise from the agreement or its execution.

2. **Exceptions**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where liability may still exist, such as in cases of fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or breaches of confidentiality and exclusivity obligations. This means that while lost profits are generally disclaimed, there are circumstances under which a party could still be liable for such losses.

3. **Broad Scope**: The language used (""however caused and on any theory of liability"") indicates that the disclaimer of lost profits applies regardless of how the loss occurs, whether through breach of contract, tort, negligence, or other legal theories. This broad scope reinforces the intent to limit liability for lost profits comprehensively.

4. **Indemnification**: The clause also mentions that damages required to be paid to a third party as part of an indemnification claim are not included in this disclaimer. This means that if a party is required to indemnify another for lost profits due to a third-party claim, they may still be liable in that context.

In summary, this clause is a clear disclaimer of liability for lost profits, establishing that parties to the agreement cannot claim damages for lost profits under normal circumstances, while also outlining specific exceptions where liability may still apply.",5

1. **Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause begins by stating that neither party makes any representations or warranties about the agreement or the transactions involved, except for those specified in Section 7.1. This sets a foundation for understanding that the parties are not guaranteeing any specific results or profits from the agreement.

2. **Specific Disclaimers**: The clause goes on to specifically disclaim any representations or warranties regarding:
   - (A) The amount of sales revenues that may occur during the term of the agreement.
   - (B) Any economic or other benefits that might be obtained through participation in the agreement.

3. **Implication for Lost Profits**: By including these disclaimers, the clause effectively protects both parties from claims related to lost profits. If one party were to suffer a loss of profits as a result of the agreement or its execution, they would have limited grounds to claim damages based on the expectations of profit, as the clause clearly states that no such expectations or guarantees are made.

4. **Legal Protection**: This type of disclaimer is common in contracts to mitigate risk and clarify that parties should not rely on potential profits or benefits that are not explicitly stated in the agreement. It helps to prevent disputes over lost profits by establishing that such outcomes were not promised or guaranteed.

In legal contracts, a disclaimer of punitive damages serves to protect parties from being held liable for damages that are intended to punish a party for wrongdoing rather than to compensate the injured party for actual losses. In this clause, the language specifies that neither LBIO nor MD Anderson, nor their affiliates or employees, will be liable for ""special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential damages."" This means that if a party were to seek punitive damages as a result of a dispute arising from the agreement or any related study order, this clause effectively limits their ability to recover such damages.

Additionally, the clause includes exceptions to this disclaimer, indicating that it does not apply in cases of indemnification obligations, breaches of confidentiality or intellectual property matters, or instances of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is important because it clarifies that while punitive damages are generally disclaimed, there are specific circumstances under which a party may still be held liable for more severe forms of misconduct.

Overall, this clause serves to limit the potential financial exposure of the parties involved in the agreement, particularly concerning punitive damages, which can be substantial and are often sought in cases of egregious behavior.",5

Here's a breakdown of the clause:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a limitation on the types of damages that can be claimed by either party. It specifically excludes punitive damages, which are typically awarded in legal cases to punish a party for particularly egregious behavior and to deter similar conduct in the future.

2. **Scope of Exclusion**: The clause mentions that this exclusion applies regardless of the legal theory under which liability is asserted (contract, tort, strict liability, etc.). This means that even if a party tries to claim punitive damages based on different legal grounds, the clause still protects against such claims.

3. **Awareness of Potential Damages**: The clause also notes that the exclusion applies irrespective of whether the parties were aware of the possibility of such losses or damages. This reinforces the intention to limit liability and avoid unexpected punitive damage claims.

4. **Reference to Other Sections**: The clause makes a reference to Section 6.3, which may contain exceptions or specific provisions regarding damages. However, it is clear that punitive damages are not included in those exceptions.

In summary, this clause serves as a clear disclaimer of punitive damages, protecting both parties from liability for such damages in connection with the agreement. This is a common practice in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable financial penalties.",5

1. **Exclusion of Punitive Damages**: In Section 11.03, the clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for ""consequential, indirect, special, incidental, punitive or exemplary loss or damage."" This means that punitive damages, which are typically awarded in legal cases to punish a party for particularly egregious behavior and deter future misconduct, are expressly excluded from liability under this agreement.

2. **Scope of Liability**: The clause emphasizes that the parties are waiving their rights to claim punitive damages, along with other types of damages, unless they fall under specific exceptions outlined in the agreement. This is a common practice in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable punitive damages.

3. **Negligence and Liability**: The clause also notes that the disclaimer of liability applies even in cases of negligence by the disclosing party or its affiliates. This reinforces the intent to limit liability, including punitive damages, regardless of the circumstances that might typically lead to such damages being awarded.

4. **Exceptions to Limitations**: While the clause generally disclaims liability for punitive damages, it does provide exceptions in Section 11.04 for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that if a party engages in particularly reckless or intentional wrongdoing, they may still be held liable, potentially including punitive damages in such cases.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it clearly outlines the parties' agreement to disclaim liability for punitive damages, thereby limiting their exposure to such claims under the terms of the contract, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct.",5

This is a clear disclaimer of liability for punitive damages, which are typically awarded in legal cases to punish a party for particularly egregious behavior and to deter similar conduct in the future.

2. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause makes an exception for indemnification obligations related to claims by third parties, meaning that while punitive damages are generally disclaimed, there may be circumstances under which one party could still be liable for such damages if they arise from third-party claims. This is an important distinction that should be noted.

3. **Foreseeability and Notification**: The clause also emphasizes that the disclaimer applies regardless of whether the damages were foreseeable or whether the parties were advised of the possibility of such damages. This strengthens the disclaimer by indicating that the parties have agreed to limit their liability in this manner, regardless of the circumstances.

4. **Legal Theories**: The clause states that the disclaimer applies regardless of the legal or equitable theory upon which a claim is based (contract, tort, etc.). This broadens the scope of the disclaimer, ensuring that punitive damages cannot be claimed under various legal theories.

2. **Scope of Damages**: The clause specifies that the limitation on liability includes not only punitive damages but also indirect, special, and consequential damages. This broad scope helps to ensure that both parties understand the extent of their liability and the types of damages that are excluded from recovery.

3. **Awareness of Possibility**: The clause notes that this limitation applies regardless of whether the parties were advised of the possibility of such damages. This reinforces the idea that the disclaimer is comprehensive and that parties cannot claim ignorance of the risks associated with punitive damages.

4. **Disclaiming Warranties**: The latter part of the clause also includes a disclaimer of any representations or warranties regarding the tools and services involved in the agreement. This further protects the parties by limiting their liability for any issues that may arise from the use of those tools and services, including any claims that could lead to punitive damages.

(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","The clause you provided contains several important elements related to the disclaimer of strict liability, which is a legal doctrine that holds a party liable for damages or loss without the need to prove negligence or fault. Here’s how the clause is relevant to your query:

1. **Disclaimer of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the ""DISCLOSING PARTY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE SUSTAINED BY RECEIVING PARTY"" that may arise from the use of the information and materials provided. This is a clear disclaimer of liability, which is a key aspect of strict liability claims. By disclaiming liability, the Disclosing Party is attempting to limit its exposure to claims that could arise from the Receiving Party's use of the provided materials.

2. **Negligence Exception**: The clause mentions that the disclaimer applies ""even if caused by DISCLOSING PARTY'S OR ITS AFFILIATES' NEGLIGENCE,"" which is significant in the context of strict liability. Typically, strict liability does not require proof of negligence, but this clause seeks to limit liability even in cases where negligence might be alleged. This reinforces the intent to avoid liability for damages that could arise from the use of the information, regardless of the circumstances.

3. **Limitation on Types of Damages**: The clause also specifies that neither party will be liable for ""consequential, indirect, special, incidental, punitive or exemplary loss or damage."" This further limits the scope of liability and is relevant to strict liability claims, as it narrows the types of damages that can be pursued, thereby reducing the potential for liability.

4. **Exceptions to Limitations**: Paragraph 11.04 outlines exceptions to the limitations on liability, specifically for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that while the parties are disclaiming liability for most claims, they are still accountable for serious misconduct. This is important because it acknowledges that there are circumstances under which liability cannot be waived, which is a common principle in legal agreements.

In summary, the clause is relevant to the disclaimer of strict liability as it outlines the limitations of liability for the Disclosing Party, including a broad disclaimer of responsibility for damages, even in cases of negligence, while also recognizing certain exceptions where liability cannot be disclaimed. This structure is designed to protect the Disclosing Party from various claims, including those that might arise under strict liability principles.",5

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages. This is a common way to limit liability in contracts, and it serves to protect parties from extensive financial exposure that could arise from unforeseen consequences of their actions or failures.

2. **Exclusion of Certain Claims**: The clause mentions that liability is disclaimed for damages ""of any kind whatever and however caused,"" which includes claims based on tort (including negligence). This aligns with the concept of strict liability, where a party can be held liable regardless of fault. By including this disclaimer, the parties are effectively stating that they will not be held strictly liable for certain types of damages.

3. **Exceptions**: The clause also notes exceptions to this limitation, such as in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that while the parties are disclaiming liability for certain damages, they are still accountable for serious misconduct, which is a critical distinction in legal agreements.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The first part of the clause states that neither party shall be liable for indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages. This is significant because strict liability often involves holding a party liable for damages regardless of fault or negligence. By including this limitation, the parties are effectively disclaiming liability for certain types of damages that could arise, which may include those typically associated with strict liability claims.

2. **Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause also includes a disclaimer of any representations or warranties, both express and implied. This includes a specific disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In the context of strict liability, which can arise from product defects or failures to meet certain standards, this disclaimer serves to protect the parties from liability that could arise from claims related to the quality or performance of the tools and services provided under the agreement.

3. **Overall Risk Allocation**: By including these disclaimers, the parties are clearly defining the scope of their responsibilities and liabilities, thereby allocating risk. This is particularly important in contracts where strict liability could otherwise impose significant risks on one or both parties.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: By disclaiming all other warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, the parties are attempting to limit their liability.

3. **Applicable Law**: The clause mentions that the disclaimer is to the full extent allowed by applicable law. This is important because strict liability laws can vary by jurisdiction, and some jurisdictions may not allow certain disclaimers to be enforceable. However, the clause indicates an intention to limit liability as much as possible under the law.

This is a common way to limit liability in contracts and can serve as a disclaimer of strict liability, which typically holds a party liable regardless of fault or negligence.

2. **Exclusions**: The clause also notes exceptions to this limitation, specifically mentioning that it does not apply to obligations related to indemnity, confidentiality, or cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that while the parties are limiting their liability for most damages, they are still accountable for serious breaches or misconduct, which is important in maintaining a level of responsibility.

3. **Strict Liability Context**: In the context of strict liability, which often applies in tort law where a party can be held liable without proof of negligence, this clause serves to limit the scope of liability in a contractual relationship.

1. **Waiver of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable to the other for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. This aligns with the concept of a damages waiver, as it limits the liability of the parties involved in the agreement.

2. **Scope of Waiver**: The waiver is comprehensive, covering a wide range of damages that could arise from breaches of the agreement. This indicates a unilateral approach to limiting liability, as it applies to both parties equally, preventing either from claiming these types of damages against the other.

3. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause includes a provision that allows for indemnification against claims from unaffiliated third parties. This means that while the parties waive their rights to claim indirect damages from each other, they still have obligations to protect each other from third-party claims, which may include indirect damages. This aspect is important as it delineates the boundaries of the waiver.

4. **Negligence and Fault**: The clause states that the waiver applies regardless of the negligence or fault of the party whose liability is being waived. This reinforces the unilateral nature of the waiver, as it protects a party even if they are found to be at fault.

5. **Broad Applicability**: The clause is designed to apply to all events or conditions, whether anticipated or unanticipated, which further emphasizes the intent to limit liability comprehensively.

Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The clause you provided, titled ""Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages,"" is relevant to the query about a ""unilateral indirect damages waiver"" because it outlines the parties' agreement to waive certain types of damages in the event of a dispute arising from the contract.

1. **Unilateral Waiver**: The clause indicates that each party unconditionally and irrevocably waives their right to claim punitive or exemplary damages from the other party. This can be seen as a unilateral waiver because each party is giving up their right to seek these types of damages without requiring a reciprocal waiver from the other party.

2. **Indirect Damages**: While the clause specifically mentions punitive or exemplary damages, it implicitly suggests a limitation on other forms of non-compensatory damages, which may include indirect damages. Indirect damages are typically those that are not a direct result of a breach but may arise as a consequence of the breach (e.g., lost profits, reputational harm). By waiving the right to punitive damages, the parties are also likely limiting their ability to claim other non-compensatory damages.

3. **Acknowledgment of Adequate Remedies**: The clause emphasizes that both parties acknowledge that the remedies provided in the agreement, as well as other legal or equitable remedies, are sufficient. This reinforces the idea that the parties are intentionally limiting their potential claims to ensure that they do not seek indirect or punitive damages, which can often be more speculative and harder to quantify.

4. **Legal Understanding**: The clause also notes that both parties are experienced in negotiating such agreements and have had legal counsel, indicating that they fully understand the implications of waiving these types of damages. This is important in the context of enforceability, as it shows that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily.

In summary, this clause serves as a clear statement of the parties' intent to waive certain types of damages, including potentially indirect damages, which aligns with the concept of a unilateral indirect damages waiver. It limits the scope of recoverable damages in any disputes arising from the agreement, thereby providing a measure of predictability and risk management for both parties.",5

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**: This section establishes that neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages. This includes damages for loss of profit, revenue, business, or data. The waiver of these types of damages is unilateral in the sense that it applies to both parties, meaning neither can claim such damages from the other. This is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from extensive liability that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause specifies exceptions to this waiver, such as damages awarded to a third party in a judgment for which a party is entitled to indemnification, or damages arising from breaches of confidentiality. This indicates that while the parties are waiving liability for indirect damages, they still recognize certain situations where liability may arise, thus providing a balanced approach.

3. **Limitation of Damages (Section 8.3)**: This section further limits the aggregate liability of either party to a specified amount, reinforcing the idea that the parties are not liable for damages beyond this limit. This limitation complements the waiver of indirect damages by capping potential liabilities, which is a common risk management strategy in contracts.

In summary, the clause is relevant to the query about unilateral indirect damages waiver as it outlines the limitations on liability for indirect damages, establishes exceptions, and sets an aggregate cap on damages, thereby protecting both parties from extensive financial exposure due to indirect consequences of their contractual relationship.",5

1. **Waiver of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party (nor their affiliates, officers, directors, or employees) shall be liable for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages suffered by the other party under the agreement. This is a form of a unilateral waiver, as it limits the liability of one party (or both parties) regarding certain types of damages.

2. **Scope of Damages**: The clause categorically excludes liability for indirect damages, which typically include losses that are not a direct result of an action but rather a secondary consequence (e.g., lost profits, loss of business opportunities). This aligns with the concept of a damages waiver, as it seeks to protect the parties from claims for these types of damages.

3. **Exceptions**: The clause also notes exceptions to this waiver, such as in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that while the parties are waiving liability for indirect damages in most circumstances, they are still accountable for serious breaches of duty or intentional wrongdoing.

4. **Indemnification Sections**: The clause references indemnification provisions (Sections 16.1 and 16.2), indicating that while there is a waiver of liability for indirect damages, the parties may still have obligations to indemnify each other for certain claims, which could include direct damages or claims from third parties.

In summary, this clause serves as a unilateral indirect damages waiver by limiting liability for certain types of damages, thereby protecting the parties from claims that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions under the agreement.",5

9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination.

It is relevant to the query about a ""unilateral indirect damages waiver"" in several ways:

1. **Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**: This section explicitly states that neither party will be liable for incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages. This aligns with the concept of a unilateral indirect damages waiver, as it limits the types of damages that can be claimed by either party. In essence, it waives the right to recover indirect damages, which are often considered to be outside the direct scope of the contract.

2. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**: This section further reinforces the waiver of certain types of damages by stating that each party waives the right to recover economic losses or damages under tort theories, including negligence and misrepresentation. This is a unilateral waiver of indirect damages, as it prevents one party from claiming such damages from the other, regardless of the circumstances.

3. **Essential Elements (Section 9.7)**: This section emphasizes that the limitations of liability are essential to the agreement. This indicates that both parties have agreed to these waivers and limitations as a fundamental part of their contractual relationship, which is a key aspect of a unilateral damages waiver.

This clause outlines the limitations on liability for both parties involved in the agreement, specifically addressing the waiver of certain types of damages.

Here’s how the clause relates to the concept of a mutual indirect damages waiver:

1. **Mutuality**: The clause applies equally to both parties, meaning that neither party can hold the other liable for the specified types of damages. This mutual aspect is essential in contracts to ensure fairness and balance in the allocation of risk.

2. **Types of Damages Waived**: The clause explicitly lists the types of damages that are waived, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, as well as loss of profits or revenues. This aligns with the concept of a mutual indirect damages waiver, as it seeks to limit liability for damages that are not directly caused by a breach of the agreement.

3. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause includes a provision that allows for indemnification against claims from unaffiliated third parties. This means that while the parties waive liability for indirect damages to each other, they still have obligations to protect each other from certain claims that may arise from third parties, which is a common exception in such waivers.

4. **Broad Applicability**: The clause states that it applies regardless of the circumstances, including negligence or fault of the party whose liability is being waived. This reinforces the strength of the waiver, ensuring that it holds even in cases where one party may have contributed to the situation leading to the damages.

In summary, this clause effectively serves as a mutual indirect damages waiver by limiting the liability of both parties for certain types of damages, thereby managing risk and protecting both parties from potentially significant financial exposure arising from indirect consequences of their contractual relationship.",5

1. **Mutual Waiver**: The clause indicates that both parties (referred to as ""each Party"") are mutually waiving their rights to claim certain types of damages. This aligns with the idea of a mutual indirect damages waiver, as both parties are agreeing to limit their potential claims against each other.

2. **Types of Damages Waived**: The clause specifically mentions the waiver of ""punitive or exemplary damages."" While the term ""indirect damages"" is not explicitly used, punitive damages are often considered a form of non-compensatory damages, which do not directly compensate for a loss but are intended to punish the wrongdoer. This suggests that the parties are also waiving claims for damages that are not directly tied to actual losses incurred.

3. **Acknowledgment of Adequate Remedies**: The clause states that both parties acknowledge that the remedies provided in the agreement, as well as other legal or equitable remedies, are adequate. This reinforces the idea that the parties are intentionally limiting their exposure to certain types of damages, including indirect or non-compensatory damages, as they believe the agreed-upon remedies are sufficient.

4. **Legal Understanding**: The clause also emphasizes that both parties are experienced in negotiating such agreements and have had legal counsel, indicating that they fully understand the implications of waiving these types of damages. This is important in the context of enforceability, as it shows that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily.

In summary, the clause serves as a mutual waiver of certain types of damages, including punitive and potentially indirect damages, which is directly relevant to the concept of a mutual indirect damages waiver. It establishes the parties' intent to limit their liability and outlines the types of damages that are not recoverable in any disputes arising from the agreement.",4

The waiver of these types of damages is a key aspect of mutual indirect damages waivers, as it protects both parties from claims that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions or failures under the agreement.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where liability may still arise, such as indemnification claims against third parties and breaches of confidentiality. This means that while the parties are waiving liability for indirect damages in most circumstances, they still retain certain rights and protections in specific situations.

3. **Limitation of Damages (Section 8.3)**: This section further limits the aggregate liability of either party to a specified amount, which is another common feature in mutual waivers. It ensures that even if a party were to be found liable, the extent of that liability is capped, providing a level of predictability and risk management for both parties.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that fall into these categories as a result of the other party's actions or breach of the agreement, they cannot seek compensation for those losses. This is a common practice in contracts to limit liability and protect parties from extensive financial exposure.

2. **Legal Enforceability**: The enforceability of such waivers can be subject to applicable laws. While the clause attempts to limit liability for indirect damages, the effectiveness of this waiver may depend on the jurisdiction's laws. Some jurisdictions may have specific statutes or legal precedents that restrict or invalidate such waivers, especially if they are deemed unconscionable or if they violate public policy.

3. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause includes a provision that the waiver does not limit a party's obligation to indemnify the other party against claims from unaffiliated third parties.

4. **Negligence Consideration**: The clause states that it applies regardless of the negligence or fault of the party whose liability is being waived. This broadens the scope of the waiver but also raises questions about its enforceability under certain laws, as some jurisdictions may not allow a party to waive liability for damages resulting from their own negligence.

This is particularly relevant to the concept of an ""indirect damage waiver,"" which typically refers to a provision that limits or excludes liability for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

Here’s how the clause relates to the query about the indirect damage waiver being subject to law:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the provider shall not be liable for any incidental or consequential damages, which aligns with the concept of an indirect damage waiver. This means that if a party suffers losses that are not directly caused by the other party's actions (such as loss of revenue or profit), they cannot claim compensation for those losses.

2. **Direct vs. Indirect Damages**: The clause differentiates between direct damages (which can be claimed) and indirect damages (which are waived). It specifies that liability is limited to direct damages proven, thereby waiving liability for indirect damages. This is a common legal practice to protect parties from extensive liability that could arise from unforeseen consequences of their actions.

3. **Legal Compliance**: The phrase ""subject to law"" implies that while the parties may agree to limit liability in this manner, such waivers must still comply with applicable laws. Certain jurisdictions may have laws that restrict or invalidate waivers of liability for certain types of damages, particularly in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Therefore, while the clause attempts to limit liability, it must be enforceable under the governing law of the agreement.

4. **Enforceability**: The enforceability of an indirect damage waiver can depend on various factors, including the clarity of the language used, the fairness of the terms, and the specific legal standards in the jurisdiction where the contract is enforced. Courts may scrutinize such waivers to ensure they are not unconscionable or contrary to public policy.

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: Section 27.2 explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, or consequential damages related to a purchase order. This means that if a party suffers indirect damages (which are typically losses that are not a direct result of an action, such as lost profits or business opportunities), they cannot claim compensation for those damages under this contract.

2. **Legal Limitations**: The clause also acknowledges that certain liabilities cannot be excluded or limited by law. For instance, Section 27.1 states that the provisions do not apply in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, death, or personal injuries. This indicates that while the contract attempts to limit liability for indirect damages, it must still comply with applicable laws that may prevent such limitations in certain circumstances.

3. **Direct Damages Acknowledgment**: Section 27.3 clarifies that damages resulting from breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or data security obligations are considered direct damages and are not subject to the same limitations as indirect damages. This distinction is important because it highlights that while indirect damages are waived, direct damages related to specific obligations are still actionable.

4. **Overall Liability Caps**: Sections 27.4 and 27.5 outline the caps on liability for both parties, which further emphasizes the intention to limit exposure to damages. However, these caps are also subject to the legal framework, meaning that if the law dictates that certain liabilities cannot be limited, those legal requirements will take precedence over the contractual limitations.

In summary, the clause illustrates how the indirect damage waiver operates within the context of legal limitations. It attempts to limit liability for indirect damages while acknowledging that certain liabilities cannot be waived or limited due to legal requirements. This balance is crucial in ensuring that the contract remains enforceable and compliant with applicable laws.",5

This is relevant to your query about the indirect damage waiver being subject to law for several reasons:

1. **Definition of Consequential Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that are not directly caused by the other party's actions but are instead secondary or indirect (such as lost profits or business opportunities), they cannot seek compensation for those damages under this agreement.

2. **Legal Enforceability**: The enforceability of such waivers or limitations on liability can be subject to applicable laws. Different jurisdictions may have varying rules regarding the enforceability of liability waivers, especially concerning indirect or consequential damages. For example, some jurisdictions may not allow parties to waive liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct, as noted in the clause.

3. **Indemnification Exceptions**: The clause also clarifies that the limitation of liability does not apply to indemnification obligations outlined in other sections of the agreement (Sections 16.1 and 16.2). This means that while the parties may waive liability for indirect damages, they still have obligations to indemnify each other for certain claims, which could be subject to legal scrutiny.

4. **Foreseeability and Notification**: The clause mentions that the limitation applies even if the damages were foreseeable or if one party was advised of the possibility of such losses. This aspect can be significant in legal contexts, as some laws may require a different standard for liability based on foreseeability.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the parties' agreement to limit liability for indirect damages while also indicating that such limitations may be subject to legal standards and exceptions based on jurisdictional law.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect damages,"" it is common in legal agreements to interpret limitations of liability as excluding indirect, consequential, or punitive damages. This aligns with the concept of an indirect damage waiver, which typically seeks to limit or exclude liability for damages that are not a direct result of a party's actions.

3. **Subject to Law**: The phrase ""subject to law"" implies that the enforceability of this limitation of liability clause, including any waivers of indirect damages, may be governed by applicable laws. Certain jurisdictions may have laws that restrict or invalidate limitations on liability, particularly for negligence or willful misconduct. Therefore, while the clause seeks to limit liability, its effectiveness may be contingent upon the legal framework in which the agreement is enforced.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it establishes the framework for liability limitations, including potential waivers of indirect damages, while also acknowledging that such limitations must comply with applicable laws.",4

Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;
(4) If the indemnifying party elects not to compromise or defend the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may pay, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability, with a reservation of all rights to seek indemnification hereunder against the indemnifying party; provided, that Indemnitee may enter into a settlement without the consent of the indemnifying party after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the indemnifying party, if the terms of such settlement (i) include only money damages as a remedy, (ii) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on the indemnifying party's business and (iii) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by the indemnifying party; and
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations between the parties involved in the agreement, specifically detailing how one party (the indemnifying party) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party (the Indemnitee) from losses arising from third-party claims. This is particularly relevant to your query about an ""indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver"" for several reasons:

1. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause specifies that indemnification covers losses resulting from breaches of duty, representations, or obligations under the agreement, as well as negligence or willful misconduct. This means that if one party's actions lead to a third-party claim, they are responsible for indemnifying the other party, which could include indirect damages if they arise from such claims.

2. **Indirect Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect damages,"" the context of indemnification often includes various types of damages, including consequential or indirect damages, depending on the specific terms of the agreement. If the parties wish to carve out indirect damages from the indemnification obligation, this would need to be explicitly stated in the agreement.

3. **Claims Procedure**: The detailed claims procedure outlined in the clause provides a framework for how claims are to be handled, which is crucial when considering any carveouts. If indirect damages are to be excluded from indemnification, the parties would need to ensure that the claims procedure accommodates this exclusion and that it is clearly communicated in the agreement.

4. **Negotiation of Terms**: The clause allows for negotiation and consultation between the parties regarding the defense and settlement of claims. If one party wants to limit indemnification to exclude indirect damages, this would be a point of negotiation that should be clearly documented in the agreement.

5. **Legal Enforceability**: The clause also notes that indemnification may be void or unenforceable under applicable law. This is important when considering any carveouts, as the enforceability of such exclusions would need to be assessed under relevant legal standards.

In summary, the indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it establishes the framework for indemnification obligations, which can be modified to include or exclude certain types of damages, such as indirect damages. If the parties wish to create a carveout for indirect damages, they would need to explicitly state this in the agreement, ensuring clarity and enforceability.",4
indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,980a304336,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits. This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided contains two key sections that are relevant to your query about an indemnification carveout to an indirect damage waiver.

1. **No Liability for Consequential Damages (Section 12.3)**: This section establishes that neither party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. However, it explicitly states that this limitation does not apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other (for example, due to third-party claims or losses arising from breaches of the agreement), they cannot rely on the waiver of liability for indirect damages to avoid their indemnification obligations. This creates a carveout for indemnification obligations, ensuring that parties can still seek compensation for certain losses even if those losses are considered indirect or consequential.

2. **Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4)**: This section sets a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of each party to the other for all causes of action, regardless of whether they arise from contract or tort. It also includes a reference to indemnification provisions, indicating that the limitation on liability applies broadly but does not negate the indemnification obligations outlined in Section 12.3. 

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query because it clearly delineates the boundaries of liability concerning indirect damages while ensuring that indemnification obligations remain intact. The carveout allows parties to pursue indemnification for losses that may be classified as indirect or consequential, thereby protecting their interests in the event of certain claims or losses.",5
indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,eb935e4d2e,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits.

12.4 Limitation on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided contains two key components that are relevant to your query about an indemnification carveout to an indirect damage waiver.

1. **No Liability for Consequential Damages (Clause 12.3)**: This part of the clause establishes that neither party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. However, it explicitly states that this limitation does not apply to any obligations of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses (which are typically defined in the agreement), they cannot use the limitation on liability for consequential damages as a defense. In other words, if an indemnifiable event occurs, the indemnifying party is still responsible for those losses, even if they are considered indirect or consequential.

2. **Limitation on Liability (Clause 12.4)**: This section sets a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of each party to the other for all causes of action, regardless of whether they arise from contract, tort, or indemnification provisions. This limitation applies to all damages except for those that fall under the indemnification obligations outlined in Clause 12.3. Therefore, while the parties agree to limit their liability for direct damages, the indemnification obligations create an exception to this limitation, ensuring that parties can still seek full recovery for certain losses that are indemnifiable.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query because it establishes a clear distinction between general liability limitations (including the waiver of indirect damages) and the obligations to indemnify, which are not subject to those limitations. This creates a carveout for indemnification claims, allowing parties to recover for certain losses that would otherwise be considered indirect or consequential.",5
indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The clause provided outlines the general indemnification obligations between the parties involved in a contract. It specifies that each party must defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party and its affiliates from claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses arising from certain circumstances, particularly those related to bodily injury or damage to tangible personal property due to the negligent or intentional acts of the indemnifying party.

In the context of your query regarding an ""indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,"" the relevance lies in the following points:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause indicates that indemnification applies to claims arising from bodily injury or damage to tangible property, which are direct damages. However, it does not explicitly address indirect damages, such as lost profits or consequential damages, which are often excluded from indemnification obligations.

2. **Carveout for Indirect Damages**: An indemnification carveout typically refers to specific exclusions from the indemnification obligations. In this case, if the parties wish to exclude indirect damages (such as lost profits or other consequential damages) from the indemnification obligations, this clause would need to be modified to explicitly state that indirect damages are not covered by the indemnification provisions.

3. **Allocation of Fault**: The clause includes a mechanism for allocating fault when both parties contribute to the injury or damage. This allocation could be relevant when considering how indirect damages might be treated if they arise from a situation where both parties share responsibility.

4. **Notification and Cooperation**: The clause outlines the requirements for the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of claims and cooperate in the defense. This procedural aspect is important in the context of any carveout, as it ensures that the parties are aligned on how claims are handled, including those related to indirect damages.

In summary, while the clause primarily addresses direct damages and the obligations of indemnification, it sets the foundation for discussing how indirect damages might be treated, particularly if a carveout is to be included in the contract. If the parties intend to limit indemnification to exclude indirect damages, this should be clearly articulated in the contract to avoid ambiguity.",4

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel. Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause you provided outlines the indemnification obligations of one party (referred to as ""you"") towards another party (referred to as ""us"" and collectively as ""Indemnitees""). This clause is relevant to your query about an indemnification carveout to an indirect damage waiver in the following ways:

1. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause specifies that the indemnification obligation covers a wide range of losses and expenses incurred by the Indemnitees, including compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages, as well as legal fees and costs associated with defending against claims. This broad scope indicates that the indemnifying party is responsible for a variety of potential liabilities that may arise from their operations.

2. **Indirect Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention an indirect damage waiver, it does include a comprehensive definition of ""losses and expenses,"" which could encompass indirect damages. If the contract includes a separate clause that waives liability for indirect damages, it would be important to clarify how that interacts with the indemnification obligations outlined in this clause.

3. **Carveout for Gross Negligence**: The clause includes a carveout for indemnification in cases of gross negligence by the Indemnitees. This means that if the Indemnitees are found to be grossly negligent, the indemnifying party would not be responsible for indemnifying them for those specific liabilities. This is a critical aspect of the indemnification clause that could affect the overall liability framework, especially in relation to any indirect damage waivers.

4. **Defense Obligations**: The clause also imposes a duty on the indemnifying party to defend the Indemnitees against claims, which is a significant obligation. If there is an indirect damage waiver in place, it may limit the types of claims that can be brought against the Indemnitees, thereby affecting the scope of the indemnification and defense obligations.

5. **Interaction with Waivers**: If there is a separate waiver of liability for indirect damages in the contract, it would be essential to analyze how that waiver interacts with the indemnification obligations. For instance, if indirect damages are waived, the indemnifying party may not be liable for those damages, but they may still be required to indemnify the Indemnitees for direct damages or other specified losses.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the responsibilities and limitations of indemnification, which must be considered in conjunction with any indirect damage waivers present in the contract. Understanding the interplay between these provisions is crucial for assessing overall liability and risk management in the contractual relationship.",4
IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided addresses the limitation of liability between the parties in a contract, specifically concerning indirect damages. Here's how it relates to your query about the IP infringement exception to the indirect damage waiver:

1. **General Limitation of Liability**: The clause states that, generally, neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that are not directly caused by the other party's actions (such as lost profits, loss of business opportunities, etc.), they cannot claim damages for those losses.

2. **Exception for IP Infringement**: The clause includes a specific exception for claims or liabilities arising from the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if one party's actions lead to a claim of IP infringement (for example, if a product they provided infringes on a patent or copyright owned by a third party), the limitation on liability does not apply. In such cases, the party responsible for the infringement could be held liable for damages, including potentially indirect damages.

3. **Importance of the Exception**: This exception is crucial because IP infringement can lead to significant legal consequences, including substantial financial damages, legal fees, and reputational harm. By excluding IP infringement from the waiver of indirect damages, the clause ensures that parties remain accountable for their actions that could infringe on third-party intellectual property rights.

In summary, the clause establishes a general rule limiting liability for indirect damages while carving out an important exception for IP infringement claims, thereby ensuring that parties cannot evade responsibility for potentially serious legal issues related to intellectual property.",5

It states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages arising from the agreement. This is a common provision in contracts to limit the potential financial exposure of the parties.

In the context of your query regarding an ""IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,"" the relevance of this clause lies in the exceptions it lists. The clause specifies that the limitation of liability does not apply in connection with:

1. Breaches of Article 7 (which likely pertains to intellectual property rights or related obligations).
2. Specific sections related to representations and warranties (Section 8.1.5).
3. Indemnification obligations of either party under Sections 9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d).

If the breach involves intellectual property (IP) infringement, it would likely fall under the exceptions mentioned in the clause. This means that if one party infringes on the other's intellectual property rights, the limitation of liability for indirect damages would not apply, allowing the injured party to seek damages that might otherwise be waived under the general limitation of liability.

In summary, the clause is relevant because it establishes that while the parties generally waive liability for indirect damages, they retain the right to seek such damages in cases of IP infringement and other specified breaches. This ensures that parties are held accountable for serious violations related to intellectual property, which is critical in protecting their rights and interests.",5

Specifically, it states that neither party will be liable for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, as well as loss of profits or revenues arising from the agreement or any breach thereof.

In the context of your query regarding an ""IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,"" the clause is relevant for the following reasons:

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly waives liability for indirect damages, which typically includes damages that are not a direct result of a breach but rather a secondary consequence. This is important in the context of intellectual property (IP) infringement, as such claims can often lead to indirect damages, such as loss of business opportunities or reputational harm.

2. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause includes a provision that states the waiver of liability does not limit a party's obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties. This is crucial in the context of IP infringement, as third-party claims can arise if one party's actions infringe on the intellectual property rights of another party. The indemnification provision suggests that if a third party claims that one party has infringed on their IP rights, the other party can seek indemnification, even if the damages claimed by the third party are indirect or consequential.

3. **Protection Against Third-Party Claims**: The clause's focus on third-party claims indicates that while the parties may waive liability for indirect damages between themselves, they still recognize the potential for third-party claims related to IP infringement. This means that if one party's actions lead to a third-party claim of IP infringement, the other party can seek protection and compensation through indemnification, regardless of the waiver of indirect damages.

In summary, while the clause generally waives liability for indirect damages between the parties, it carves out an exception for third-party claims, particularly relevant in the context of IP infringement. This ensures that parties are still protected against potential claims that could arise from their actions, even if those claims involve indirect damages.",5

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that, with the exception of liability arising from Section 9.3 (which pertains to intellectual property infringement), neither party will be liable for indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that are not directly caused by the other party's actions (such as loss of profits or goodwill), they cannot seek compensation for those losses.

2. **IP Infringement Exception**: The clause makes a clear exception for claims related to intellectual property infringement. This means that if one party infringes on the intellectual property rights of the other, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages that may arise from that infringement. In other words, if a party is found liable for IP infringement, they may be held accountable for both direct and indirect damages resulting from that infringement.

3. **Cap on Liability**: Additionally, the clause sets a cap on liability for claims not related to IP infringement, limiting it to the amount earned by the party in the twelve months preceding the claim. However, this cap does not apply to claims arising from IP infringement, further emphasizing the seriousness of such claims and the potential for greater liability.

### Conclusion:

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a framework where indirect damages are generally waived, but provides a significant exception for intellectual property infringement. This means that parties cannot escape liability for IP-related claims, which can include both direct and indirect damages, thereby protecting the rights of the party whose intellectual property has been infringed.",5

### Key Points of Relevance:

1. **Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**:
   - This section states that neither party will be liable for incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including lost profits or loss of business, as a result of any breach of the agreement. This broad waiver of liability could potentially include damages arising from intellectual property (IP) infringement claims, unless specifically carved out.

2. **Equitable Relief (Section 9.1)**:
   - The clause allows either party to seek equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief, for breaches of obligations under Article 13 of the agreement. If Article 13 pertains to IP rights or obligations, this could provide a pathway for a party to seek relief in the event of IP infringement, despite the general waiver of indirect damages.

3. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**:
   - This section further emphasizes that both parties waive the right to recover economic losses or damages under tort theories, which could include claims related to IP infringement. However, it is important to note that this waiver is specific to economic losses and does not necessarily preclude all forms of legal action related to IP infringement.

4. **Essential Elements (Section 9.7)**:
   - The parties acknowledge that the limitations of liability are essential to the agreement. This suggests that any exceptions to these limitations, such as those related to IP infringement, would need to be explicitly stated in the agreement to be enforceable.

### Conclusion:
The clause as it stands generally limits liability for indirect damages, including those that could arise from IP infringement. If there is a desire to create an exception for IP infringement claims, it would need to be explicitly included in the agreement, as the current language does not provide such an exception. Therefore, if a party wishes to retain the right to claim damages for IP infringement, it should negotiate for specific language that carves out such claims from the general waiver of liability.",5
third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided addresses the limitation of liability between the parties involved in a contract, specifically concerning indirect damages. Here's how it relates to your query about the third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement exception:

1. **General Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that are not directly caused by the other party's actions (such as lost profits, loss of business opportunities, etc.), they cannot claim damages for those losses.

2. **Exception for Third-Party IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly carves out an exception for claims or liabilities arising from the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if one party's actions lead to a claim that they have infringed on a third party's IP rights, the limitation on liability for indirect damages does not apply. In such cases, the party may be held liable for those indirect damages resulting from the infringement.

3. **Importance of the Exception**: This exception is significant because it protects third-party IP rights holders and ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious claims of IP infringement by relying on the general waiver of indirect damages. It acknowledges the potential severity and implications of IP infringement, which can lead to significant financial losses for the affected third party.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it outlines a specific scenario where the typical waiver of liability for indirect damages does not apply, thereby ensuring accountability for third-party IP infringement claims.",5
third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,5da8e756e1,"9.3. Limitation of Liability. Except in connection with a breach by either party of Article 7 or Section 8.1.5 [REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES] (v) and the indemnification obligations of Impresse under Section 9.4(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY IMPRESSE] and the indemnification obligations of VerticalNet under Section 9.5(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET], neither party will be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages arising out of or related to this Agreement, however caused and under any theory of liability (including negligence), even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.3, outlines a limitation of liability between the parties involved in the agreement. It states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages arising out of or related to the agreement. This means that if one party suffers damages that are not direct or immediate (such as lost profits or business opportunities), they cannot hold the other party liable for those damages.

In the context of your query regarding a ""third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,"" the relevance of this clause lies in the exceptions it outlines. The clause specifies that the limitation of liability does not apply in certain situations, including breaches of specific articles and sections related to representations, warranties, and indemnification obligations.

If a third party claims that one of the parties has infringed on their intellectual property (IP), this could potentially lead to indirect damages for the party being accused. However, if the indemnification obligations under Sections 9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d) are triggered, the party responsible for the infringement may be liable for those indirect damages despite the general waiver of liability for such damages in Section 9.3.

In summary, while Section 9.3 generally limits liability for indirect damages, the exceptions provided in the clause indicate that if there is a breach related to IP infringement or indemnification obligations, the parties may still be held liable for those indirect damages. This creates a critical distinction in the context of third-party IP infringement claims, as it allows for potential liability despite the overarching waiver of indirect damages.",5

The relevance of this clause to your query about a ""third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver"" can be broken down as follows:

1. **Direct Reference to IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that the limitations on liability do not apply to liability arising from Section 9.3, which pertains to Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. This means that if one party infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party, they cannot invoke the limitations on liability to avoid responsibility for damages resulting from that infringement.

2. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause waives liability for indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages, but this waiver does not apply in cases of IP infringement. Therefore, if a party is found liable for infringing on a third party's IP rights, they could be held accountable for both direct and indirect damages, despite the general waiver of such damages in other contexts.

3. **Cap on Liability**: The clause also sets a cap on liability, limiting it to the amount earned under the revenue-sharing provisions in the preceding twelve months. However, this cap does not apply to claims arising from IP infringement. This means that if a party is liable for infringing a third party's IP, they could potentially face damages that exceed this cap.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query because it establishes that while the parties generally waive liability for indirect damages, this waiver does not extend to claims related to IP infringement. This creates an exception that protects the rights of third parties and ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious infringements by relying on the limitations set forth in the contract.",5

Specifically, it waives liability for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, as well as loss of profits or revenues arising from the agreement or any breach thereof.

However, the clause includes a critical exception: it states that the waiver of liability does not limit a party's obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties. This means that if a third party makes a claim against one of the parties (for example, a claim of intellectual property infringement), the party that is obligated to indemnify must still cover the costs associated with that claim, including any special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages that may arise from it.

In the context of your query regarding ""third party IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,"" this clause is particularly relevant because it explicitly states that the waiver of indirect damages does not apply when it comes to claims from third parties. Therefore, if a third party alleges that one of the parties has infringed on their intellectual property rights, the party responsible for the infringement may still be liable for damages, even if those damages would typically be considered indirect or consequential.

In summary, this clause ensures that while the parties may limit their liability to each other for certain types of damages, they cannot limit their liability when it comes to third-party claims, particularly those related to intellectual property infringement. This protects the parties from potential significant financial exposure arising from third-party claims, which could include substantial damages that would otherwise be waived under the agreement.",5

Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 13.4 on Limitation of Liability, is relevant to your query about the third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement exception to the indirect damage waiver for several reasons:

1. **General Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a general rule that neither party will be liable for special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages. This means that, under normal circumstances, if one party suffers damages that fall into these categories, they cannot seek compensation from the other party.

2. **Exception for Third Party Claims**: The clause includes a specific exception related to third-party claims. It states that the limitation of liability does not apply if special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages have been awarded to a third party under a third-party claim. This implies that if a third party successfully claims damages against one of the parties (for example, due to IP infringement), the party that is liable to the third party may not be able to invoke the limitation of liability clause to avoid compensating the other party for those damages.

3. **Implications for IP Infringement**: In the context of IP infringement, if a third party claims that one of the parties has infringed on their intellectual property rights and is awarded damages, the party that is found liable for the infringement may have to compensate the other party for any indirect damages that arise as a result of that third-party claim. This creates a potential liability for indirect damages that would otherwise be waived under the limitation of liability clause.

4. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also notes that it does not limit a party's indemnification obligations. If one party is required to indemnify the other for losses arising from third-party claims (including IP infringement), this could further impact the applicability of the limitation of liability.

In summary, while the clause generally limits liability for indirect damages, it carves out an exception for damages awarded to third parties, particularly in the context of IP infringement claims. This means that parties should be aware that they may still face liability for indirect damages if a third party successfully claims such damages against them.",5
"indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third party IP infringement and fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct",a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided is relevant to your query regarding indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement, as well as fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. Here's how it connects:

1. **Exclusion of Third-Party IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that it does not apply to claims or liabilities arising from the infringement of any third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if one party's actions lead to a claim of IP infringement by a third party, the liability for that claim is not waived. In other words, the party responsible for the infringement can still be held liable for damages, even if those damages are considered indirect or consequential.

2. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause generally waives liability for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. This is a common practice in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable damages that could arise from a breach or other claims. However, the waiver does not apply to the specific situation of third-party IP infringement, which is a critical exception.

3. **Exclusion of Other Liabilities**: While the clause does not explicitly mention fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, it is common for contracts to have separate provisions addressing these issues. Typically, parties do not want to limit liability for actions that are considered particularly egregious or intentional, as these can have significant legal and financial implications. Therefore, while the clause does not directly address these exclusions, they are often implied in the context of liability waivers.

In summary, the clause effectively limits liability for indirect damages while ensuring that claims related to third-party IP infringement are not subject to this limitation. It highlights the importance of carefully drafting liability clauses to protect parties from significant risks while also ensuring accountability for serious breaches of conduct.",4

It is relevant to your query regarding indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement and fraud, as well as gross negligence or willful misconduct, for the following reasons:

1. **Exclusion of Liability for Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, remote, exemplary, or speculative damages. This aligns with the concept of a damage waiver, as it limits the types of damages that can be claimed, particularly those that are not direct or foreseeable.

2. **Exceptions to the Limitation**: The clause outlines specific exceptions to the limitation of liability:
   - **Fraud**: It states that if a party commits fraud, they are not protected by the limitation of liability. This means that claims related to fraudulent actions are not subject to the waiver of indirect damages.
   - **Breach of Intellectual Property Obligations**: The clause also specifies that breaches of obligations under Article 7 (which presumably deals with intellectual property) are excluded from the limitation. This means that if a party infringes on the intellectual property rights of another, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages.
   - **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**: The clause mentions that if damages are required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification, those damages are also excluded from the limitation. This is particularly relevant to third-party IP infringement claims, as it indicates that if a party is required to indemnify another for such claims, they cannot limit their liability for those damages.

3. **General Exclusions**: The clause does not explicitly mention gross negligence or willful misconduct, but typically, such conduct is also excluded from liability limitations in many contracts. This is often implied in legal contexts, as parties cannot contractually limit liability for actions that are grossly negligent or intentionally harmful.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations on liability for indirect damages while also specifying exceptions for fraud, breaches of IP obligations, and indemnification for third-party claims. It effectively creates a framework that protects parties from liability for indirect damages while holding them accountable for certain serious breaches and misconduct.",5

1. **Limitations on Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages, as well as lost profits or lost revenue. This aligns with the concept of a damage waiver, as it limits the scope of liability for certain types of damages that could arise from the contract.

2. **Exclusions for Specific Circumstances**: The clause includes exceptions for cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud. This is significant because it indicates that while the parties are waiving liability for indirect damages, they are not waiving liability for serious misconduct or fraudulent actions. This is a common practice in contracts to ensure that parties are held accountable for egregious behavior.

3. **Indemnification and Breach of Specific Sections**: The clause mentions that indemnification claims under Section 5 and breaches of specific sections (such as trademarks, confidentiality, and agency relationship) are also excluded from the limitations on liability. This suggests that if a party infringes on third-party IP rights (which could fall under the trademark section), they would not be able to rely on the waiver of indirect damages as a defense.

4. **No Injunctive Relief**: The clause states that the non-breaching party is not entitled to equitable or injunctive relief. This further emphasizes the limitation on remedies available to the parties, reinforcing the idea that indirect damages are waived, and that parties cannot seek injunctive relief for the types of damages covered by the waiver.

In summary, this clause effectively limits liability for indirect damages while maintaining accountability for serious misconduct and specific breaches, including those related to third-party IP infringement. It serves to protect both parties from extensive liability while ensuring that they remain responsible for significant breaches of conduct.",5

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause explicitly waives liability for indirect damages, which aligns with your request for a waiver of indirect damages. It limits the scope of liability to direct damages, thereby protecting both parties from claims for indirect or consequential damages that could arise from the agreement.

2. **Exclusions for Specific Breaches**: The clause includes exceptions for breaches related to specific sections of the agreement, such as Article 7 and Section 8.1.5, which likely pertain to representations and warranties. While the clause does not explicitly mention third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, it does indicate that certain breaches (like those related to indemnification obligations) are not subject to the limitation of liability. This suggests that if either party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they may still be held liable despite the general waiver of indirect damages.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**: The references to indemnification obligations under Sections 9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d) imply that if either party is required to indemnify the other for claims related to IP infringement or other serious breaches, the limitation of liability would not apply. This is crucial because it means that while indirect damages are generally waived, the parties still have responsibilities that could lead to liability in cases of serious misconduct or infringement.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it outlines a framework for limiting liability for indirect damages while also indicating that certain serious breaches, including potential third-party IP infringement and acts of fraud or gross negligence, are excluded from this limitation.

1. **Exclusion of Liability for Indirect Damages**: 
   - **Clause 27.2** states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, or consequential damages related to a purchase order. This aligns with the concept of an indirect damage waiver, as it limits liability for damages that are not directly caused by a breach or failure to perform under the contract.

2. **Exclusions for Specific Types of Liability**:
   - **Clause 27.1** explicitly states that the limitations of liability do not apply in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud. This means that if either party engages in gross negligence or willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages resulting from such actions. This is relevant to your query as it indicates that the waiver of indirect damages does not protect a party from liability arising from these serious breaches.

3. **Acknowledged Direct Damages**:
   - **Clause 27.3** clarifies that damages resulting from breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or data security obligations are considered direct damages, not indirect. This is important because it indicates that certain types of damages are recognized as direct and are not subject to the indirect damage waiver.

4. **Limitation of Liability for Specific Obligations**:
   - **Clauses 27.4 and 27.5** outline the limitations of liability for both parties, specifying that certain obligations (like indemnification and breaches of confidentiality) are not subject to the limitations. This means that if a party infringes on third-party IP rights or engages in fraud, they cannot limit their liability under the terms of the contract.

This is crucial because it establishes that while economic losses are waived, personal injury claims are not subject to this waiver. Therefore, if a party suffers personal injury as a result of the other party's actions, they retain the right to seek damages for that injury.

3. **Implications for Personal Injury Claims**: The clause effectively creates a distinction between economic damages (which are waived) and personal injury damages (which are not waived). This means that if a party were to suffer bodily injury due to the actions or negligence of the other party, they would still have the right to pursue a claim for those injuries, despite the general waiver of liability for indirect damages.

In summary, while the clause limits liability for many types of damages, it explicitly carves out an exception for personal or bodily injury claims, allowing parties to seek compensation for such injuries even in the context of an indirect damage waiver. This is an important consideration for any party entering into the agreement, as it highlights the potential for liability in cases of personal injury.",5

Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.
9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination.

Specifically, it addresses the waiver of liability for incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, which is relevant to your query about the personal or bodily injury exception to an indirect damage waiver.

Here’s how the clause relates to your query:

1. **Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**: This section explicitly states that neither party will be liable for incidental or consequential damages, which includes economic losses and damages resulting from breaches of the agreement. However, it does not mention personal injury or bodily injury, which are typically treated differently under the law. This suggests that while economic damages are waived, personal injury claims may not be subject to the same waiver.

2. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**: This section further clarifies that both parties waive the right to recover economic losses or damages under tort theories, including negligence, except for personal injury or damage to other tangible property. This indicates that personal injury claims are not waived and can still be pursued, even in the context of this agreement.

3. **Implications for Personal Injury Claims**: The language in Section 9.5 specifically states that economic losses and damages do not include personal injury. Therefore, if a party suffers a personal injury as a result of the other party's actions or negligence, they retain the right to seek damages for that injury, despite the broader waiver of liability for economic losses.

In summary, the clause establishes a framework that limits liability for certain types of damages while explicitly excluding personal or bodily injury claims from that limitation. This means that individuals can still pursue claims for personal injury even if other types of damages are waived under the agreement.",5

27.2 Indirect Damages. In no event will either PARTY be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages in any way related to a relevant

27.3 Acknowledged Direct Damages. Any damages resulting from breach of confidentiality, privacy or data security obligations pursuant to an applicable

1. **Personal or Bodily Injury Exception**: 
   - **Clause 27.1** explicitly states that the limitations of liability do not apply in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, death, or personal injuries caused by negligence or willful misconduct. This means that if a party causes personal or bodily injury due to their negligence or intentional wrongdoing, they cannot invoke the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for those damages. This is a critical exception to the general waiver of liability for indirect damages.

2. **Indirect Damages**: 
   - **Clause 27.2** establishes that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, or consequential damages related to a purchase order. However, the exception in Clause 27.1 indicates that this waiver does not extend to personal injuries, which are considered direct damages in this context.

3. **Acknowledged Direct Damages**: 
   - **Clause 27.3** clarifies that damages resulting from breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or data security obligations are acknowledged as direct damages. This reinforces the idea that certain types of damages, including personal injury, are treated differently than indirect damages.

4. **Limitation of Liability for Each Party**: 
   - Clauses 27.4 and 27.5 outline the limitations of liability for both parties, but they also include exceptions for indemnification obligations and breaches of confidentiality or data security. These exceptions further emphasize that personal injury claims are not subject to the same limitations as indirect damages.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query because it clearly delineates the exceptions to the indirect damage waiver, particularly concerning personal or bodily injury. It establishes that parties cannot limit their liability for such injuries, ensuring that victims of negligence or misconduct have recourse for their damages.",5

In any action or proceeding between the Parties (including any arbitration proceeding) arising under or with respect to this Agreement or in any manner pertaining to the Hyatt All-Inclusive Resorts or to the relationship of the Parties under this Agreement, each Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives and releases any right, power or privilege either may have to claim or receive from the other Party any punitive or exemplary damages, each Party acknowledging and agreeing that the remedies herein provided and other remedies at law or in equity will in all circumstances be adequate. Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The clause you provided, titled ""Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages,"" addresses the waiver of certain types of damages that one party may seek from the other in the event of a dispute arising from the agreement. Specifically, it states that both parties waive their rights to claim punitive or exemplary damages against each other. 

In the context of your query regarding a ""personal or bodily injury exception to indirect damage waiver,"" this clause is relevant because it outlines the limitations on the types of damages that can be claimed. While the clause specifically mentions the waiver of punitive or exemplary damages, it does not explicitly address personal or bodily injury claims. 

Typically, personal or bodily injury claims are treated differently from other types of damages, such as indirect or consequential damages. Many contracts include exceptions for personal injury or bodily injury claims, meaning that parties may still pursue compensation for such claims even if they have waived other types of damages. 

In this case, if the agreement does not include a specific exception for personal or bodily injury claims, it could be interpreted that the waiver of non-compensatory damages does not apply to those types of claims. Therefore, if a party were to suffer a personal or bodily injury as a result of the actions of the other party, they may still have the right to seek damages for that injury, despite the waiver of punitive or exemplary damages outlined in the clause.

In summary, while the clause waives certain types of damages, it does not explicitly address personal or bodily injury claims, which may allow for exceptions to the waiver in those specific circumstances. It is important to review the entire agreement and any applicable laws to fully understand the implications of this clause in relation to personal or bodily injury claims.",4

This is relevant to your query about confidentiality exceptions to the indirect damage waiver for several reasons:

1. **Scope of Liability Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that fall into these categories, they cannot seek compensation from the other party under the agreement.

2. **Indemnification Sections**: The clause notes that the limitation of liability does not apply to amounts payable to third parties under the indemnification provisions (Sections 16.1 and 16.2). This is significant because it implies that if a party is required to indemnify a third party for damages that may include indirect damages, the waiver of liability does not protect them from those obligations.

3. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause also specifies that the limitation of liability does not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that if a party's actions are deemed grossly negligent or intentionally harmful, they cannot rely on the waiver to avoid liability for consequential damages.

4. **Confidentiality Context**: While the clause does not directly address confidentiality, it is important to consider that breaches of confidentiality could potentially lead to indirect damages (e.g., reputational harm, loss of business opportunities). If a party were to breach confidentiality, the other party might argue that the waiver of indirect damages should not apply in such cases, especially if the breach involved gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations on liability for indirect damages while also indicating exceptions that could apply in cases of indemnification or serious misconduct. Understanding these nuances is crucial when considering the implications of confidentiality breaches and the potential for indirect damages arising from such breaches.",5

The relevance of this clause to your query about confidentiality exceptions to the indirect damage waiver lies in the specific exceptions mentioned in the clause itself.

1. **General Limitation of Liability**: The clause states that neither party can recover special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages from the other party in connection with the agreement. This is a standard limitation of liability clause that seeks to protect both parties from extensive financial exposure due to indirect damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Limitation**: Importantly, the clause includes two specific exceptions:
   - **Breach of Article 8 (Confidentiality)**: The first exception allows either party to recover special, incidental, or consequential damages if the other party breaches the confidentiality obligations outlined in Article 8. This means that if one party discloses confidential information in violation of the agreement, the other party can seek damages that would otherwise be waived under the limitation of liability.
   - **Indemnification Rights or Obligations**: The second exception pertains to indemnification rights or obligations under Article 11. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses or damages, the limitation of liability does not apply.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query because it explicitly states that breaches of confidentiality (Article 8) are an exception to the general waiver of indirect damages. This means that if a party breaches confidentiality, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for the resulting damages.",5

This waiver is a common provision in contracts to limit the potential liability of the parties involved.

In the context of your query regarding ""confidentiality exceptions to indirect damage waiver,"" the clause is relevant in the following ways:

1. **Scope of Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for indirect damages. This means that if one party suffers indirect damages as a result of a breach of confidentiality, they may not be able to claim those damages under this waiver.

2. **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**: The clause includes a provision that allows for indemnification against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties. This means that if a third party claims damages (including indirect damages) due to a breach of confidentiality, the party responsible for the breach may still have an obligation to indemnify the other party. This creates an exception to the general waiver of indirect damages, as it allows for liability in the context of third-party claims.

3. **Confidentiality Breaches**: If the breach of confidentiality leads to claims from third parties (for example, if confidential information is leaked and results in a lawsuit from a third party), the indemnification provision would apply, allowing the affected party to seek compensation for those claims, even if they are considered indirect damages.

4. **Limitations on Liability**: The clause emphasizes that the waiver of liability applies regardless of the circumstances, including negligence. However, the indemnification for third-party claims creates a critical exception that could allow for recovery in cases where confidentiality is breached and results in third-party claims.

In summary, while the clause generally waives liability for indirect damages, it provides an exception for indemnification related to third-party claims, which can be particularly relevant in cases involving breaches of confidentiality. This means that parties should be aware that while they may not recover for their own indirect damages, they may still have recourse if a breach of confidentiality leads to claims from third parties.",5

It establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. However, it includes specific exceptions related to breaches of confidentiality and indemnification obligations.

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **Breach of Confidentiality**: The clause explicitly states that damages arising from a party's breach of confidentiality (as outlined in Article 12) are not subject to the limitation of liability. This means that if one party fails to uphold their confidentiality obligations, they can be held liable for any resulting damages, including indirect or consequential damages. This is significant because it underscores the importance of confidentiality in the agreement and ensures that parties cannot evade responsibility for breaches that could lead to significant harm.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: Similarly, the clause notes that damages arising from indemnification obligations (also referenced in Article 11) are exempt from the limitation of liability. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses or claims, they cannot limit their liability for those specific damages.

3. **Overall Impact**: The inclusion of these exceptions indicates that while the parties generally agree to limit their liability for indirect damages, they recognize that breaches of confidentiality and indemnification obligations are serious matters that warrant full accountability. This creates a balance between limiting liability for less severe issues while ensuring that critical obligations, such as protecting confidential information, are taken seriously.

This means that if a party breaches its confidentiality obligations, the other party may still seek damages for that breach, even if those damages could be classified as indirect or consequential. 

In summary, while the clause limits liability for indirect damages in general, it makes an exception for breaches of confidentiality obligations, allowing a party to pursue claims for damages resulting from such breaches.

Here's how it relates to your query about the carveout for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct in the context of an indirect damage waiver:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**: This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, which include lost profits and other indirect damages. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for certain situations, including:
   - Breach of confidentiality (Article 10).
   - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct by either party.
   - Indemnification obligations under Article 12.

   This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the waiver of indirect damages to avoid liability for those actions. Essentially, this clause ensures that parties are held accountable for serious misconduct, regardless of the general limitation on liability for indirect damages.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**: Similar to Section 11.6, this section limits a party's aggregate liability to a specified amount, but it also includes exceptions for:
   - Breach of confidentiality.
   - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.
   - Indemnification obligations.

   Again, this reinforces that if a party commits fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they cannot invoke the liability cap to limit their responsibility for those actions.

3. **Indemnification (Sections 12.1 and 12.2)**: These sections outline the indemnification obligations of each party. They specify that a party will indemnify the other for claims arising from their own fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This further emphasizes the importance of accountability for serious misconduct, as it obligates the offending party to cover losses incurred by the other party due to such actions.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a clear framework that excludes fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from the general waivers of liability for indirect damages. This ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious wrongdoing, thereby promoting accountability and protecting the interests of the non-offending party.",5

Here's how it is relevant to your query about the carveout to the indirect damage waiver:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**: This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, which include lost profits and other indirect damages. However, there are exceptions to this waiver, specifically:
   - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: The clause explicitly states that damages arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct are not subject to the limitation on consequential damages. This means that if one party engages in such conduct, they can be held liable for indirect damages resulting from that conduct.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**: Similar to Section 11.6, this section limits a party's aggregate liability under the agreement. However, it also includes exceptions for:
   - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: Again, the liability limit does not apply to claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This reinforces the idea that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct, even if they would otherwise be protected by a liability cap.

3. **Indemnification (Sections 12.1 and 12.2)**: These sections outline the indemnification obligations of each party. They specify that a party will indemnify the other for claims arising from their own fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if one party's actions in these categories lead to a claim from a third party, they are responsible for covering the losses incurred by the other party.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a clear carveout from the general waiver of indirect damages and liability limits for cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This ensures that parties cannot avoid liability for serious wrongdoing, thereby providing a level of protection for the other party in the agreement.",5

Here's how it relates to your query about the fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct carveout to the indirect damage waiver:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**: This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, which include lost profits and other indirect damages. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions to this waiver, including damages arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if one party engages in such serious misconduct, they cannot rely on the waiver to avoid liability for the resulting damages.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**: This section further limits the aggregate liability of each party under the agreement. Similar to Section 11.6, it includes a carveout for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if a party is found to have acted with fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the limitation on liability does not apply, allowing the other party to seek full recovery for damages resulting from such actions.

3. **Overall Implications**: The inclusion of these carveouts is significant because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for their most egregious actions (fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct) by relying on the general waiver of indirect damages. This is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from being unfairly disadvantaged by the other party's serious misconduct.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the specific circumstances under which a party can be held liable for indirect damages, despite the general waiver of such damages, particularly in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.",5

Here's how it connects:

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause establishes that both parties (Bioamber and Cargill) agree to waive claims for various types of indirect damages, including consequential, punitive, incidental, and special losses. This means that, generally, neither party can hold the other liable for these types of damages arising from their contractual relationship.

2. **Carveout for Gross Negligence and Willful Misconduct**: The clause explicitly states that the waiver of claims does not apply if the claims are based on a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is a critical exception (or carveout) to the general waiver of indirect damages. It means that if one party engages in gross negligence (a severe degree of negligence) or willful misconduct (intentional wrongdoing), they cannot rely on the waiver to avoid liability for indirect damages resulting from those actions.

3. **Implications**: This carveout is significant because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct simply by invoking the waiver of indirect damages. It provides a level of protection for the parties against egregious behavior that could cause significant harm, even if that harm is classified as indirect.

In summary, the clause you provided effectively limits liability for indirect damages while simultaneously ensuring that parties remain accountable for serious misconduct, such as gross negligence or willful misconduct. This balance is crucial in legal contracts to protect the interests of both parties involved.",5

Here's how it connects:

1. **General Disclaimer of Liability**: The clause begins with a broad disclaimer of liability for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that, under normal circumstances, neither party will be held liable for these types of damages, regardless of how they arise (e.g., contract, tort, etc.).

2. **Carveout for Specific Circumstances**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply in cases of ""gross negligence or willful misconduct."" This is a critical carveout because it means that if one party engages in gross negligence or willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the waiver of liability for indirect damages. 

3. **Implications for Indemnification**: The clause also notes that the limitation of liability does not restrict amounts payable to third parties under indemnities provided in other sections of the agreement. This reinforces the idea that even if indirect damages are waived, there are still obligations to indemnify third parties, which may arise from actions that could be considered gross negligence or willful misconduct.

4. **Fraud Consideration**: While the clause does not explicitly mention fraud, it is often treated similarly to gross negligence and willful misconduct in legal contexts. Therefore, if fraud is involved, the party committing the fraud may also be held liable for indirect damages, despite the general waiver.

In summary, this clause establishes a framework where, while indirect damages are generally waived, parties can still be held accountable for serious misconduct, such as gross negligence or willful misconduct, thereby providing a safeguard against egregious behavior. This is crucial for ensuring that parties cannot escape liability for serious wrongdoing simply by invoking a waiver of indirect damages.",5

1. **No Consequential Damages (Clause 11.6)**: This clause explicitly states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for any lost profits, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the agreement. The exceptions to this waiver are critical to your query.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause lists specific circumstances under which the waiver of consequential damages does not apply:
   - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: The clause explicitly states that the waiver does not apply to a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if a party engages in fraudulent behavior or acts with gross negligence or willful misconduct, they can still be held liable for consequential damages arising from those actions.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: The waiver also does not apply in connection with a party's indemnification obligations, which may include claims related to personal injury or other liabilities.

3. **Liability Limit (Clause 11.7)**: This clause further limits a party's aggregate liability but also includes exceptions for fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct.

1. **No Consequential Damages (Clause 11.6)**: This clause explicitly states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for any lost profits, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the agreement. The exceptions listed in the clause include:
   - Breach of confidentiality (Article 10).
   - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct (subsection E).
   - Indemnification obligations (Article 12).

   This means that if a party commits fraud, is grossly negligent, or engages in willful misconduct, they are not protected by the waiver of consequential damages. Therefore, the waiver does not apply to these specific types of liability.

2. **Liability Limit (Clause 11.7)**: Similar to Clause 11.6, this clause sets a limit on a party's aggregate liability but also includes exceptions for fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct.

1. **Consequential Damages Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for ""any lost profits, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary or consequential damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with this Agreement."" This means that, generally, the parties are waiving their rights to claim indirect damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause lists specific exceptions where the waiver of consequential damages does not apply. Notably, it states that the waiver does not apply to:
   - A party's fraud
   - A party's gross negligence
   - A party's willful misconduct

   This indicates that if a party engages in fraudulent behavior, is grossly negligent, or acts with willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the waiver to avoid liability for consequential damages.

3. **Negligence and Personal Injury**: The clause also mentions that the limitations on liability apply ""even if a party has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy."" However, the exceptions for fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct suggest that if a party's negligence rises to the level of gross negligence, or if it results in personal injury, the waiver of indirect damages would not apply.

4. **Indemnification Obligations**: Additionally, the clause states that the limitations on liability do not apply to a party's indemnification obligations. This could be relevant in cases where personal injury claims arise, as indemnification may involve compensating for damages that include indirect or consequential damages.

In summary, the clause indicates that while there is a general waiver of indirect damages, this waiver does not apply in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. Therefore, if a party is found liable for such actions, they could still be held accountable for indirect damages, including those related to negligence or personal injury, depending on the circumstances.",5

1. **General Indirect Damages Waiver (27.2)**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, or consequential damages related to a purchase order, regardless of foreseeability or prior communication about the possibility of such damages. This indicates a broad waiver of indirect damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver (27.1)**: However, the first subsection (27.1) clarifies that the provisions regarding limitation of liability do not exclude or limit responsibility in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, death, or personal injuries caused by negligence or willful misconduct. This means that if a party engages in fraud or gross negligence, they cannot rely on the indirect damages waiver to avoid liability.

3. **Direct Damages Acknowledgment (27.3)**: The clause also specifies that damages resulting from breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or data security obligations are considered direct damages, not indirect. This further emphasizes that certain types of damages are treated differently and are not subject to the indirect damages waiver.

4. **Specific Limitations on Liability (27.4 and 27.5)**: The subsequent sections outline specific limitations on liability for both parties, indicating that while there are caps on liability for certain breaches, these caps do not apply in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breaches of confidentiality.

In summary, while the clause generally waives liability for indirect damages, it explicitly states that this waiver does not apply in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury. Therefore, a party cannot use the indirect damages waiver to escape liability for these serious offenses.",5

EXCEPT (I) IN THE EVENT OF THE FRAUD OF A PARTY OR OF A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 7 (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) OR ARTICLE 10 (CONFIDENTIALITY), OR (II) TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO A THIRD PARTY AS PART OF A CLAIM FOR WHICH A PARTY PROVIDES INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE 9, NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR SUBLICENSEES SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, REMOTE, EXEMPLARY OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES OR OTHER DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT PROBABLE AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THAT PARTY OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, OR OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED THE POSSIBILITY OF, ANY SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE; PROVIDED, FOR CLARITY, [***]. ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.5, addresses the limitation of liability between the parties involved in the contract. It outlines the circumstances under which one party may be held liable for damages, particularly focusing on the exclusion of certain types of damages, such as indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, remote, exemplary, or speculative damages.

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **Indirect Damages Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for indirect damages, which includes a broad range of damages that are not directly caused by a breach or wrongdoing. This waiver is significant because it limits the potential financial exposure of each party in the event of a dispute.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause includes specific exceptions where the limitation of liability does not apply:
   - **Fraud**: If a party commits fraud, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages resulting from that fraud.
   - **Breach of Intellectual Property or Confidentiality Obligations**: If a party breaches its obligations under Article 7 (Intellectual Property) or Article 10 (Confidentiality), the limitation does not apply.
   - **Indemnification**: If damages are required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification, the limitation does not apply.

3. **Negligence and Personal Injury**: The clause does not explicitly mention negligence or personal injury in the exceptions, but it does state that liability for indirect damages is waived in general. However, in many jurisdictions, liability for personal injury or gross negligence may not be waivable, depending on local laws. Therefore, while the clause limits liability for indirect damages, it may not fully protect a party from liability arising from negligence or personal injury claims, especially if those claims are severe or involve gross negligence.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the clause serves to limit liability for indirect damages while providing specific exceptions for fraud, breaches of certain obligations, and indemnification claims. It is crucial for parties to understand that while they may be protected from indirect damages, they could still be liable for direct damages resulting from fraud, breaches of key obligations, or potentially negligence and personal injury, depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances.",5

Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations between the parties involved in the agreement. It is particularly relevant to your query regarding the ""personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout"" for several reasons:

1. **Indemnification for Personal Injury**: The clause explicitly states that each party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party from any loss, damage, injury, or liability arising from claims related to personal injury or death. This indicates that personal or bodily injury claims are specifically covered under the indemnification provisions, which is crucial for understanding how these types of claims are treated in the context of the agreement.

2. **Direct vs. Indirect Damages**: The clause does not explicitly mention a waiver of indirect damages; however, it does provide a framework for indemnification that could be interpreted as a carveout for certain types of claims, including those related to personal injury. In many contracts, indemnification clauses are designed to ensure that parties are protected from direct claims arising from their own negligence or misconduct, which can include personal injury claims. This suggests that even if there is a general waiver of indirect damages, personal injury claims may not be subject to that waiver.

3. **Claims Procedure**: The detailed claims procedure outlined in the clause ensures that if a personal injury claim arises, the indemnified party (Indemnitee) must notify the indemnifying party (indemnifying party) and follow specific steps for handling the claim. This procedure is important for managing liability and ensuring that both parties are aware of potential claims, which can help mitigate risks associated with personal injury.

4. **Control of Defense**: The clause allows the indemnifying party to control the defense of any claims, including those related to personal injury, which can be significant in managing the legal and financial implications of such claims. This control can influence how personal injury claims are handled and settled, further emphasizing the importance of the indemnification framework in the context of bodily injury.

5. **Exclusions and Limitations**: While the clause does not explicitly state any exclusions or limitations regarding personal injury claims, the language suggests that these claims are treated with a level of importance that may not apply to other types of indirect damages. This could imply that personal injury claims are not subject to the same waivers or limitations that might apply to other indirect damages.

In summary, the indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it establishes the framework for how personal or bodily injury claims are treated in the context of indemnification, potentially serving as an exception to any general waivers of indirect damages. It highlights the parties' obligations to indemnify each other for such claims, the procedures for handling them, and the control over the defense of these claims, which are critical elements in understanding the legal implications of personal injury in the agreement.",4
personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout,469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The clause you provided outlines a general indemnification provision that includes specific language regarding personal or bodily injury and damage to tangible personal property. This is relevant to your query about the ""personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout"" for several reasons:

1. **Indemnification for Bodily Injury**: The clause explicitly states that each party shall indemnify the other for claims arising from bodily injury (including death). This indicates that, regardless of any general waiver of indirect damages, claims related to personal injury are carved out from that waiver. This means that if a party is held liable for bodily injury due to their negligence or intentional acts, they cannot rely on a waiver of indirect damages to avoid responsibility.

2. **Negligence and Intentional Acts**: The clause specifies that indemnification applies to claims arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors. This reinforces the idea that if a party's actions lead to bodily injury, they are responsible for indemnifying the other party, regardless of any general limitations on liability.

3. **Allocation of Fault**: The clause also includes a provision for the allocation of damages if the indemnified party or a third party contributed to the injury. This means that even if both parties share some responsibility, the indemnifying party is still obligated to indemnify the other party for the damages related to bodily injury, which further supports the exception to any waiver of indirect damages.

4. **Exclusivity of Defense**: The clause grants the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle claims. This is significant because it places the responsibility for handling claims related to bodily injury squarely on the indemnifying party, ensuring that they cannot escape liability through a waiver of indirect damages.

In summary, this indemnification clause creates a clear exception for personal or bodily injury claims, ensuring that such claims are not subject to any waivers of indirect damages. This is crucial for protecting the parties involved from potential liabilities arising from bodily injury, regardless of other contractual limitations.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout,eb935e4d2e,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits. This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided contains two key sections that are relevant to your query regarding the personal or bodily injury exception to the waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout.

1. **No Liability for Consequential Damages (Clause 12.3)**: This section establishes that neither party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. However, it explicitly states that this limitation does not apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses, the waiver of liability for indirect damages does not apply to those indemnification obligations. 

   In the context of personal or bodily injury, if such injuries are classified as ""Indemnifiable Loss,"" the indemnifying party would still be liable for those damages despite the general waiver of indirect damages. This creates a carveout for indemnification obligations, ensuring that parties cannot escape liability for personal or bodily injury claims through the general limitation on consequential damages.

2. **Limitation on Liability (Clause 12.4)**: This section further limits each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for all causes, regardless of the form of action (contract or tort) or whether the claim arises from indemnification provisions. However, it does not specifically address personal or bodily injury claims. 

   The relevance here is that while the limitation on liability applies broadly, the indemnification carveout in Clause 12.3 suggests that personal or bodily injury claims may not be subject to the same limitations as other types of damages. If a personal or bodily injury claim arises, it may fall under the indemnification obligations, thus allowing for recovery despite the limitations set forth in Clause 12.4.

In summary, the clauses together indicate that while there is a general waiver of liability for indirect damages, personal or bodily injury claims may still be recoverable through indemnification, thereby creating an exception to the waiver of indirect damages. This is crucial for parties to understand, as it affects their potential liability and the scope of indemnification in the event of personal or bodily injury.",5

However, it explicitly states that this limitation does not apply to obligations of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses, the waiver of liability for indirect damages does not apply. 

   In the context of personal or bodily injury, if such injuries are considered ""Indemnifiable Losses,"" the indemnification obligation would take precedence over the limitation on liability for consequential damages. Therefore, if a party suffers personal or bodily injury due to the actions of the other party, the injured party may seek indemnification, and the limitation on indirect damages would not prevent recovery for those specific losses.

2. **Limitation on Liability (Section 12.4)**: This section further limits each party's liability to a specified maximum amount for all causes of action, including those arising from contract or tort (which encompasses negligence). However, it does not negate the indemnification obligations outlined in Section 12.3. 

   If personal or bodily injury claims arise, they may not be subject to the same limitations as other types of claims, especially if they fall under the indemnification provisions. This means that while the parties may have agreed to limit their liability for certain types of damages, personal or bodily injury claims could still be pursued, potentially leading to liability beyond the stated maximum aggregate liability.

In summary, the clauses you provided indicate that while there is a general waiver of liability for indirect damages, this waiver does not apply to indemnification obligations, particularly in cases of personal or bodily injury. This creates a carveout that allows for recovery of damages related to such injuries, despite the broader limitations on liability.",5

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel.

Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause you provided outlines the indemnification obligations of one party (presumably the franchisee) to another party (presumably the franchisor and its affiliates) in the context of claims arising from the operation of the franchised business. Here’s how it relates to your query regarding a personal or bodily injury exception to a waiver of indirect damages via an indemnification carveout:

1. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause specifies that the indemnifying party (the franchisee) must indemnify the Indemnitees (the franchisor and its affiliates) for a wide range of losses and expenses incurred due to claims arising from the operation of the franchised business. This includes claims related to the maintenance and operation of vehicles, which could encompass personal or bodily injury claims.

2. **Exclusion of Gross Negligence**: The clause includes a provision that the indemnity does not apply to liabilities arising from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees. This is significant because it means that if a claim arises from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees, the indemnifying party is not responsible for indemnifying them for that claim. This could be relevant in cases of personal injury where the Indemnitees' actions (or lack thereof) could be deemed grossly negligent.

3. **Definition of Losses and Expenses**: The clause defines ""losses and expenses"" to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages, which could encompass damages awarded in personal injury cases. This broad definition indicates that the indemnifying party is responsible for a wide range of potential damages, including those that might arise from personal injury claims.

4. **No Waiver of Indirect Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention a waiver of indirect damages, the indemnification obligation itself implies that the indemnifying party is responsible for direct claims, which could include personal injury claims. If there were a specific carveout for personal or bodily injury claims, it would need to be explicitly stated in the clause. The absence of such a carveout suggests that personal injury claims are included within the scope of indemnification, unless they arise from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees.

5. **Legal Defense Obligations**: The clause also outlines the obligation of the indemnifying party to defend the Indemnitees against claims, which is particularly relevant in personal injury cases where legal defense can be costly and complex.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it establishes the framework for how personal or bodily injury claims are treated in the context of indemnification. It indicates that the indemnifying party is generally responsible for such claims unless they arise from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees, and it outlines the obligations related to legal defense and the types of damages covered. If there is a need for a specific exception for personal or bodily injury claims, it would need to be clearly articulated in the contract.",5

Here’s a breakdown of how this clause relates to your query:

1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that fall into these categories as a result of the other party's actions or breach of the agreement, they cannot claim compensation for those losses.

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**: The clause includes a significant exception: it states that the waiver of liability does not limit a party's obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties. This means that if a third party makes a claim against one of the parties for damages that could be classified as indirect or consequential, the party may still be responsible for indemnifying the other party.

3. **Implications for First Party Claims**: The clause primarily addresses the relationship between the two parties (the first party and the second party) and limits their liability to each other for indirect damages. However, it does not prevent either party from pursuing claims against the other for direct damages or for claims that do not fall under the categories of waived damages. 

4. **Negligence and Liability**: The clause also states that the waiver applies regardless of the negligence or fault of the party whose liability is being waived. This reinforces the strength of the waiver, indicating that even if one party is found to be negligent, they are still not liable for the specified types of damages.

In summary, this clause is crucial in defining the scope of liability between the parties, particularly concerning indirect damages. It establishes a clear boundary that protects both parties from claims for indirect damages while allowing for exceptions in the case of third-party claims. Understanding this clause is essential for assessing the risks and liabilities involved in the agreement.",5

It states that neither party can claim, nor will they be liable for, indirect damages and losses. This includes special or consequential losses, loss of anticipated profits or revenue, anticipated savings, and damage to goodwill or brand equity.

In the context of your query regarding a ""first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages,"" the clause is relevant because it establishes a baseline understanding of what types of damages are excluded from claims. 

1. **First Party Claims**: These typically refer to claims made by one party against the other for direct losses or damages resulting from a breach of contract or other obligations. The clause specifically excludes indirect damages, which means that if a party suffers losses that fall under the definition of indirect damages, they cannot seek compensation for those losses.

2. **Exception to Waiver**: If there is a discussion about a ""first party claim exception,"" it would imply that there may be circumstances under which a party could still seek compensation for certain types of damages that might otherwise be considered indirect. For example, if a party can demonstrate that their claim is for direct damages rather than indirect damages, they may argue that the waiver does not apply.

In summary, the clause sets a limitation on liability for indirect damages, and understanding this limitation is crucial when considering whether a first party claim could be an exception to this waiver. If a claim can be framed as a direct loss rather than an indirect one, it may not be subject to the waiver, allowing the claiming party to seek recovery for those damages.",5
first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages,6de4a6c172,"13.4 Limitation of Liability. Except for a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), and without limiting a Party's indemnification obligations hereunder, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party in any manner for any special, non- compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages of any kind, including lost profits and lost revenue, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability or otherwise, even if informed of or aware of the possibility of any such damages in advance, except to the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law or any such special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 13.4 on Limitation of Liability, is highly relevant to your query regarding the first party's claim exception to the waiver of indirect damages. Here’s how it connects:

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause establishes a general rule that neither party shall be liable for indirect damages, which include special, non-compensatory, consequential, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages. This means that, under normal circumstances, if one party suffers indirect damages due to the actions or omissions of the other party, they cannot claim compensation for those damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause outlines specific exceptions to this general waiver. Notably, it states that the limitation of liability does not apply in two scenarios:
   - **Breach of Confidentiality**: If there is a breach of Section 11 (""Confidentiality""), the waiver of indirect damages does not apply. This means that if a party breaches confidentiality, they could be held liable for indirect damages resulting from that breach.
   - **Third Party Claims**: The clause also provides an exception for situations where special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages have been awarded to a third party under a third-party claim. This means that if a third party successfully claims such damages against one party, the other party may not be able to rely on the waiver of indirect damages in their defense.

3. **Implications for First Party Claims**: In the context of a first-party claim (where one party is claiming against the other), the waiver of indirect damages would generally apply. However, if the claim involves a breach of confidentiality or results in a third-party claim that leads to such damages, the first party may have grounds to pursue those indirect damages despite the general waiver.

In summary, the clause provides a framework for understanding when indirect damages can be claimed and highlights the exceptions that allow for such claims, particularly in the context of breaches of confidentiality and third-party claims. This is crucial for parties to consider when assessing their potential liabilities and rights under the contract.",5

However, the phrase ""EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO OBLIGATIONS TO INDEMNIFY A PARTY FOR CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES"" indicates that there is an exception to this waiver. 

This means that if a party has an obligation to indemnify the other party for claims made by third parties, the waiver of indirect damages does not apply in that specific context. In other words, if a third party makes a claim that results in indirect damages, the party that is obligated to indemnify may still be liable for those damages, despite the general waiver of liability for indirect damages in the agreement.

In summary, the clause establishes a broad waiver of indirect damages but carves out an exception for indemnification obligations related to third-party claims, which is crucial for understanding the potential liability of the parties in such scenarios.",5

### Relevance to the Query: First Party Claim Exception to Waiver of Indirect Damages

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that a party's total liability is limited to direct damages proven, with specific exceptions for bodily injury, property damage, and willful misconduct. This means that, generally, indirect damages (such as consequential or incidental damages) are waived.

2. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause includes a clear waiver of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which encompasses losses such as loss of revenues or profits. This waiver is significant because it protects the provider from claims that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions or services.

3. **First Party Claims**: The term ""first party claim"" typically refers to claims made by one party against another under the terms of the contract. In this context, if the first party (the Company) were to claim indirect damages (like lost profits) against the second party (the Provider), the clause would serve as a defense for the Provider, as it explicitly states that they are not liable for such damages.

4. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause does not provide exceptions for indirect damages, meaning that unless the claim falls under the specific exceptions listed (like bodily injury or willful misconduct), the waiver stands firm. This is crucial for the Provider, as it limits their exposure to potentially large claims that could arise from indirect damages.

### Conclusion

In summary, the clause is relevant to the query because it establishes a framework that limits liability for indirect damages, thereby protecting the Provider from first party claims that seek to recover such damages. The explicit waiver of incidental and consequential damages means that the first party cannot successfully claim these types of damages under the terms of the agreement, unless they fall within the specified exceptions.",5

Here’s how it relates to your query:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**: This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, which include lost profits and other indirect damages. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions to this waiver. The exceptions include damages arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if one party engages in such conduct, they cannot rely on the waiver to avoid liability for consequential damages.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**: Similar to Section 11.6, this section limits a party's aggregate liability under the agreement. However, it also includes exceptions for breaches of confidentiality, fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, and indemnification obligations.

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**:
   - This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, including lost profits or indirect damages, arising from the agreement. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions to this waiver, which include:
     - Breach of confidentiality (Article 10).
     - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct by either party.
     - Indemnification obligations under Article 12.

   This means that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for consequential damages. This is significant because it ensures that parties are held accountable for serious misconduct, regardless of the general waiver of indirect damages.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**:
   - Similar to Section 11.6, this section limits a party's aggregate liability to a specified amount, but it also includes exceptions for:
     - Breach of confidentiality.
     - Fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.
     - Indemnification obligations.

   Again, this reinforces that if a party commits fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they cannot limit their liability to the agreed-upon cap. This is crucial for protecting the other party from significant harm that could arise from such serious breaches.

3. **Indemnification (Sections 12.1 and 12.2)**:
   - These sections outline the indemnification obligations of each party. They specify that a party must indemnify the other for claims arising from their own negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct. This means that if one party's misconduct leads to a claim from a third party, they are responsible for covering the losses incurred by the other party.

### Conclusion:
The clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a clear framework for how fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct are treated in the context of liability and indemnification. It ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct and that they are responsible for indemnifying the other party for losses arising from such actions. This creates a more equitable and accountable contractual relationship, particularly in scenarios where one party's actions could lead to significant harm to the other.",5

It specifically addresses exceptions to these limitations, which are highly relevant to your query about fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

### Key Points of the Clause:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**:
   - This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, which include lost profits, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising from the agreement.
   - However, it explicitly carves out exceptions to this waiver, including damages arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if one party engages in such conduct, they cannot rely on this clause to avoid liability for consequential damages.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**:
   - This section sets a cap on the aggregate liability of each party under the agreement, with specific exceptions.
   - Similar to Section 11.6, it states that the limitation on liability does not apply to claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This reinforces the idea that parties cannot limit their liability for serious misconduct.

### Relevance to Your Query:

- **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: The clause directly addresses your query by stating that if a party commits fraud, acts with gross negligence, or engages in willful misconduct, they cannot escape liability for consequential damages. This is crucial in legal contexts where one party may attempt to limit their exposure to damages through contractual provisions.
  
- **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also mentions that the limitations on liability do not apply to a party's indemnification obligations. This means that if a party is required to indemnify the other for losses arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they cannot limit their liability in this context either.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the exceptions to the waiver of indirect damages and liability limitations specifically for fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct. This ensures that parties cannot contractually shield themselves from liability for serious wrongful acts, thereby promoting accountability and protecting the interests of the aggrieved party.",5
"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout",469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The clause you provided outlines the general indemnification obligations between the parties involved in the contract. It specifies that each party must defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party and its affiliates from claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses arising from negligent or intentional acts or omissions. 

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause includes a provision for indemnification that is relevant to your query about exceptions to waivers of indirect damages. While the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect damages,"" it does establish a framework for indemnification that could be interpreted to include exceptions for certain types of misconduct, such as fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

2. **Negligent or Intentional Acts**: The clause specifically mentions that indemnification applies to claims arising from the ""negligent or intentional acts or omissions"" of the indemnifying party. This language suggests that if a party engages in gross negligence or willful misconduct, they may not be able to rely on a waiver of indirect damages, as their actions fall outside the standard of ordinary negligence.

3. **Allocation of Fault**: The clause also provides for the allocation of damages based on the relative fault of the parties involved. This means that if one party's gross negligence or willful misconduct contributed to the damages, they could be held fully or partially responsible, which would be an exception to any general waiver of indirect damages.

4. **Third-Party Claims**: The clause addresses claims brought by third parties, which is relevant in the context of indemnification. If a third party claims damages due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of one party, the indemnification obligations may come into play, potentially overriding any waivers of indirect damages.

5. **Prompt Notification and Cooperation**: The clause requires the indemnified party to promptly notify the indemnifying party of any claims. This is crucial in the context of fraud or misconduct, as timely communication can affect the ability to defend against claims and the overall liability of the parties.

### Conclusion:

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly mention exceptions for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, it establishes a framework for indemnification that could allow for such exceptions to apply. The language regarding negligent or intentional acts, allocation of fault, and the obligations of the parties suggests that if one party engages in serious misconduct, they may not be able to benefit from waivers of indirect damages. This makes the clause relevant to your query regarding the exceptions to the waiver of indirect damages through indemnification.",4
"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout",eb935e4d2e,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages.

### 1. **No Liability for Consequential Damages (Clause 12.3)**

This section establishes that neither party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. However, it explicitly states that this limitation does not apply to obligations related to indemnification for ""Indemnifiable Loss."" 

- **Relevance to Query**: The mention of indemnification indicates that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses, the limitation on liability for indirect damages does not apply. This means that if a party's actions involve fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, and those actions lead to an indemnifiable loss, the party may be liable for those indirect damages despite the general waiver. 

### 2. **Limitation on Liability (Clause 12.4)**

This section sets a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of each party to the other for all causes of action, regardless of whether they arise from contract or tort, including negligence. It also states that this limitation applies even if the party was notified of the possibility of damages.

- **Relevance to Query**: While this clause limits liability, it does not specifically address exceptions for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. However, in many legal contexts, such conduct is often treated as an exception to liability limitations. If a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they may not be able to rely on the limitation of liability to shield themselves from claims arising from such conduct. 

### Conclusion

In summary, the clauses you provided create a framework where indirect damages are generally waived, but this waiver does not apply to indemnification obligations. If a party's actions involve fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they may be held liable for indirect damages despite the limitations set forth in the agreement. Therefore, these clauses are relevant to your query as they outline the conditions under which liability for indirect damages may still be applicable, particularly in the context of indemnification and serious misconduct.",5
seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses,ff35aa7411,"9. Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties waive and relinquish any claims, demands, causes of action or recoveries for punitive damages, exemplary damages, or statutory damages. Seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the sale of the products, including any lost revenues or profits, consequential and/or incidental damages, business interruption or damage to business reputation, regardless of the theory upon which any claim may be based, including any statutory causes of action or claims. In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","The clause you provided is a ""Limitation of Liability"" clause that is designed to protect the seller from various types of damages that could arise from the sale of products under the agreement. This clause is particularly relevant to your query about seller-favorable waivers of indirect damages for several reasons:

1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the seller shall not be liable for ""indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages."" This is a seller-favorable provision because it limits the seller's exposure to claims that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions or products, such as lost profits or damage to business reputation. By waiving these types of damages, the seller reduces their potential liability significantly.

2. **Broad Scope of Waiver**: The clause includes a broad range of damages that are waived, including punitive, exemplary, and statutory damages. This comprehensive approach further protects the seller by ensuring that they are not held liable for a wide array of potential claims that could arise from the transaction.

3. **Limitation on Liability**: The clause also caps the seller's liability to the purchase price actually paid by the buyer for the products. This means that, regardless of the circumstances, the seller's maximum financial exposure is limited to the amount the buyer paid, which is a significant protection for the seller.

4. **Exclusivity of Remedies**: The clause mentions that even if the exclusive remedy fails of its essential purpose, the seller's liability is still limited to the purchase price. This reinforces the seller's position by ensuring that they cannot be held liable for more than the agreed-upon price, even in cases where the buyer may argue that the remedy provided in the agreement is insufficient.

In summary, this clause is highly relevant to your query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages, effectively limiting the seller's liability and protecting them from various claims that could arise from the sale of products.",5

This clause is relevant to your query about seller-favorable waivers of indirect damages for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a clear cap on the financial liability of both parties, which is a common practice in contracts to protect against excessive claims. This is particularly favorable to the seller, as it limits their exposure to financial risk.

2. **Exclusions from Liability Cap**: The clause specifies that the limitation of liability does not apply to claims arising from bad faith, intentional or willful misconduct, or third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. This exclusion is important because it means that while the seller is protected from indirect damages, they are still liable for serious misconduct or harm caused to third parties, which could be a significant risk.

3. **Indirect Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect damages,"" the limitation of liability inherently serves to protect the seller from such claims. Indirect damages often refer to consequential damages that are not directly caused by a breach but arise as a secondary effect. By capping liability, the seller is effectively waiving responsibility for these types of damages, which is favorable to them.

4. **Negotiation Leverage**: Including such a clause can be a point of negotiation in the contract. A seller may seek to include or strengthen this type of clause to ensure that they are not held liable for unforeseen or excessive indirect damages, thereby providing them with greater certainty and stability in their financial obligations.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it reflects a seller-favorable approach to limiting liability, particularly concerning indirect damages, while also outlining specific exclusions that maintain some level of accountability for serious breaches.",5

EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES UNDER SECTION 7.2 [Indemnity], NEITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL EXCEED [***].","The clause you provided contains two key components: a waiver of consequential damages (Clause 8.2) and a limitation of damages (Clause 8.3). Both of these components are relevant to the query regarding seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses.

1. **Waiver of Consequential Damages (Clause 8.2)**: This clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages. This is a seller-favorable provision because it limits the seller's liability for damages that are not directly caused by a breach of the contract. By excluding liability for consequential damages, the seller protects itself from claims for lost profits, revenue, or other indirect losses that the buyer might suffer as a result of a breach. This is particularly advantageous for sellers, as it reduces their potential exposure to large claims that could arise from unforeseen consequences of their actions or failures.

2. **Limitation of Damages (Clause 8.3)**: This clause further limits the seller's liability by capping the total amount that either party can claim in connection with the agreement. By specifying that neither party's aggregate liability shall exceed a certain amount (which is redacted in your clause), the seller can manage its risk and financial exposure. This limitation is also favorable to the seller, as it provides a clear boundary on potential liabilities, ensuring that they are not held responsible for excessive damages.

In summary, both clauses serve to protect the seller by limiting their liability for indirect damages and capping their overall exposure. This aligns with the query for seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses, as it demonstrates how the seller can mitigate risk through carefully crafted contractual language.",5

EXCLUSIVE OF ANY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES FOR INJURY OR DAMAGES TO PERSONS OR TANGIBLE PROPERTY DIRECTLY CAUSED BY ANY PRODUCT, NEITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ADVERTISING MATERIALS, IF ANY, WILL INCLUDE CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, EVEN IFTHE OTHER PARTY HAS KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages because it outlines the limitations of liability for both parties in the context of the agreement. Specifically, it addresses the exclusion of certain types of damages, which is a common practice in contracts to protect the interests of the seller.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause states that the liability of a party for direct damages is capped at fifteen million dollars. This is a seller-favorable provision because it limits the seller's financial exposure in the event of a claim.

2. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly waives liability for consequential, incidental, special, or other indirect damages, such as lost profits. This is particularly advantageous for the seller, as it protects them from claims that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions or products, even if they were aware of the potential for such damages.

3. **Exclusions**: The clause also specifies that the waiver of indirect damages does not apply to claims related to injury or damages to persons or tangible property directly caused by any product. This means that while the seller is protected from indirect damages in most scenarios, they still retain liability for direct harm caused by their products, which is a standard and reasonable limitation.

Overall, this clause serves to limit the seller's liability and protect them from potentially significant financial repercussions that could arise from indirect damages, making it a seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages.",5

THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY BUYER TO SUPPLIER UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM.","The clause you provided is a waiver of indirect damages, which is a common provision in contracts that limits the liability of the parties involved. In the context of your query regarding a seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages, this clause is particularly relevant for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. This is beneficial for the seller because it protects them from claims that could arise from unforeseen or indirect consequences of their actions or failures. For example, if a product fails and causes a business interruption for the buyer, the seller would not be liable for the resulting lost profits or other indirect damages.

2. **Cap on Total Liability**: The clause also includes a cap on total liability, stating that the maximum amount either party can be liable for is limited to the amounts paid or payable by the buyer to the supplier under the applicable order during the twelve-month period preceding the claim. This further protects the seller by ensuring that their financial exposure is limited to a specific amount, which is typically much lower than the potential damages that could arise from indirect claims.

3. **Seller's Risk Mitigation**: By including such a waiver, the seller mitigates their risk in the transaction. It allows them to operate with a clearer understanding of their potential liabilities, which can be crucial for financial planning and risk management.

4. **Negotiation Leverage**: In negotiations, a seller-favorable waiver of indirect damages can be a point of leverage. Sellers may be more willing to agree to other terms or concessions if they can secure a strong limitation on their liability.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable approach to limiting liability for indirect damages, thereby protecting the seller from potentially significant financial exposure while also providing a clear framework for liability in the event of a claim.",5

Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties waive and relinquish any claims, demands, causes of action or recoveries for punitive damages, exemplary damages, or statutory damages. Seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the sale of the products, including any lost revenues or profits, consequential and/or incidental damages, business interruption or damage to business reputation, regardless of the theory upon which any claim may be based, including any statutory causes of action or claims. In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","The clause you provided is a ""Limitation of Liability"" clause, which is designed to limit the liability of the seller in the event of certain types of damages arising from the sale of products under the agreement. This clause is particularly relevant to your query about ""buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses"" for several reasons:

1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that if the buyer suffers losses that are not directly caused by the seller's actions (such as lost profits or business interruption), the seller is not responsible for compensating those losses. This is a common practice in contracts to protect sellers from extensive liability.

2. **Buyer-Favorable Perspective**: From a buyer's perspective, a waiver of indirect damages can be unfavorable because it limits the buyer's ability to recover for significant losses that may arise from the seller's breach of contract or failure to deliver products as promised. Buyers typically prefer to negotiate terms that allow for some recovery of indirect damages, especially if those damages could be substantial.

3. **Limitation on Liability**: The clause also includes a cap on the seller's liability, stating that the total liability will not exceed the purchase price paid by the buyer. This further protects the seller and can be seen as a buyer-unfavorable term, as it restricts the buyer's potential recovery to a fixed amount, regardless of the actual damages incurred.

4. **Negotiation Considerations**: If a buyer is looking to negotiate a more favorable waiver of indirect damages clause, they may seek to limit the scope of the waiver, exclude certain types of damages from the waiver (such as those arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct), or negotiate a higher cap on liability. 

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it exemplifies a standard seller-favorable approach to limiting liability and waiving indirect damages, which may not align with the interests of a buyer seeking broader protections in a contract.",5

8.3 Limitation of Damages. EXCEPT FOR LIABILITIES UNDER SECTION 7.2 [Indemnity], NEITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL EXCEED [***].","The clause you provided contains two key components: **Section 8.2 (No Consequential Damages)** and **Section 8.3 (Limitation of Damages)**. Both sections are relevant to the query regarding buyer-favorable waivers of indirect damages.

### Relevance to Buyer-Favorable Waiver of Indirect Damages:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**:
   - This section explicitly states that neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages. This includes damages for loss of profit, revenue, business, or data. 
   - For a buyer, this clause is generally unfavorable because it limits the buyer's ability to recover damages that may arise from the seller's breach of contract. If the buyer suffers indirect losses due to the seller's actions (or inactions), they would not be able to claim those damages under this clause.

2. **Limitation of Damages (Section 8.3)**:
   - This section further limits the aggregate liability of either party to a specified amount (denoted as [***] in the clause). This means that even if the buyer has a valid claim, their recovery is capped at this predetermined amount.
   - Again, this is typically unfavorable for a buyer, as it restricts their potential recovery in the event of a breach or failure by the seller.

### Conclusion:
Both sections serve to protect the seller from extensive liability, particularly concerning indirect damages, which can often be significant in business transactions. For a buyer seeking a more favorable position, these clauses would need to be negotiated to allow for greater liability on the part of the seller, especially concerning indirect damages that could arise from a breach of contract. 

In summary, the clauses as they stand are not buyer-favorable; they limit the buyer's ability to recover consequential damages and cap the seller's liability, which could be detrimental to the buyer's interests in the event of a dispute.",5
buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses,f52cb3b7ad,"IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER’S OR SELLER’S LIABILITY, ONE TO THE OTHER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE RESPECTIVE OTHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD 13 MILLION; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BAD FAITH, INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause you provided outlines a limitation of liability between the buyer and seller in a contract, specifically capping the liability at USD 13 million for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, or other obligations. This clause is relevant to your query about buyer-favorable waivers of indirect damages for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a clear cap on the financial liability of both parties, which can be seen as a buyer-favorable provision if the buyer is confident that potential damages will not exceed this amount. It provides predictability regarding the maximum financial exposure.

2. **Exclusions from Limitation**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply to claims arising from bad faith, intentional or willful misconduct, or third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. This is important for the buyer because it ensures that the seller cannot escape liability for serious misconduct or harm caused to third parties, which could be critical in protecting the buyer's interests.

3. **Indirect Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect damages,"" the limitation of liability typically serves to exclude or limit liability for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages. If the clause is interpreted to limit liability to direct damages only, it could be seen as favorable to the buyer, as it protects them from potentially large claims that could arise from indirect damages.

4. **Negotiation Leverage**: If the buyer is negotiating the contract, having a clause that limits liability while excluding certain serious claims can be a strong position. It allows the buyer to mitigate risk while still holding the seller accountable for significant breaches.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines a framework for liability that can be interpreted as favorable to the buyer, particularly in terms of capping potential damages and ensuring accountability for serious misconduct. If the goal is to further enhance buyer-favorable terms, one might consider explicitly addressing indirect damages or further clarifying the scope of liability exclusions.",4

This clause is particularly relevant to your query about buyer-favorable waivers of indirect damages for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. This is a common provision in contracts to protect parties from extensive liability that could arise from unforeseen circumstances. However, it is typically more favorable to sellers or service providers, as it limits their exposure to significant financial losses.

2. **Buyer-Favorable Perspective**: From a buyer's perspective, a waiver of indirect damages can be concerning because it limits the buyer's ability to recover for losses that may arise from the seller's breach of contract. Indirect damages can include lost profits or other financial impacts that are not directly tied to the contract but are a result of the breach. A buyer-favorable waiver would ideally allow for some recovery of these types of damages, or at least not completely waive them.

3. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause includes a provision that allows for indemnification against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties. This means that while the parties waive their liability for indirect damages to each other, they still have an obligation to indemnify each other against third-party claims. This could be seen as a buyer-favorable aspect, as it provides some level of protection against external claims that could impact the buyer.

4. **Broad Applicability**: The clause states that it applies regardless of the negligence or fault of the party whose liability is being waived. This broad language can be particularly disadvantageous for buyers, as it means that even if the seller is at fault, they are still protected from liability for indirect damages.

In summary, while the clause serves to limit liability for both parties, it is generally more favorable to sellers. A buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages would ideally include provisions that allow for some recovery of indirect damages or limit the scope of the waiver to certain circumstances, rather than a blanket waiver as seen in this clause.",4

Specifically, it addresses the exclusion of certain types of damages, which is a critical aspect of liability clauses in contracts.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause states that, except for claims under Section 9 (which likely pertains to representations, warranties, and indemnification), the liability of either party for direct damages is capped at fifteen million dollars. This is a significant limitation that can be seen as favoring the seller or provider of goods/services, as it restricts the potential financial exposure.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party's liability will include consequential, incidental, special, or other indirect damages, such as lost profits. This is a common provision in contracts to protect parties from extensive liability that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions or failures. However, from a buyer's perspective, this can be unfavorable because it limits their ability to recover damages that may arise from the seller's breach or failure to perform.

3. **Knowledge of Likelihood of Damages**: The clause also notes that the exclusion of indirect damages applies even if the other party has knowledge of the likelihood of such damages. This further protects the seller from liability, as it means that even if they were aware that their actions could lead to indirect damages, they would still not be held liable.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query because it illustrates how the limitation of liability and the waiver of indirect damages can be structured in a way that may not favor the buyer. A buyer-favorable waiver would typically seek to limit the seller's ability to exclude liability for indirect damages, especially in cases where such damages could be significant and foreseeable. Therefore, a buyer may want to negotiate for more favorable terms that allow for the recovery of indirect damages under certain circumstances.",4
