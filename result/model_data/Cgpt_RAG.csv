England Governing Law,6a8b24fc6b,This Agreement is governed by English law.,"The clause ""This Agreement is governed by English law"" is directly relevant to the query regarding ""England Governing Law"" as it explicitly states that the legal framework applicable to the agreement is that of England. This means that any disputes arising from the agreement will be interpreted and enforced according to English law, and the courts in England will have jurisdiction over any legal matters related to the agreement.

In the context of the provided external information, while the excerpts discuss enforcement, jurisdiction, and remedies under different legal systems (specifically mentioning Delaware law and courts), the clause in question establishes a clear choice of law that is distinct from those references.

Clause with multiple governing laws,05ef7e7d77,"This Agreement and any and all matters arising directly or indirectly herefrom shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the [***] applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely in such state, including its statutes of limitation but without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.","The clause you provided outlines the governing law for the agreement, specifying that it will be governed by the internal laws of a particular state (indicated by [***]). This is relevant to the query about clauses with multiple governing laws because it establishes a clear legal framework for interpreting and enforcing the agreement.

In the context of multiple governing laws, this clause could be expanded or modified to address situations where different aspects of the agreement might be subject to different legal jurisdictions. For example, if certain provisions of the agreement are to be interpreted under the laws of one state while others are governed by the laws of another, the clause would need to explicitly state this.

The external information provided includes examples of clauses that discuss jurisdiction and the enforcement of rights, which can be relevant when considering how to structure a clause that incorporates multiple governing laws. For instance, the references to specific jurisdictions (like the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware) and the acknowledgment of irreparable harm and the right to seek equitable relief suggest that the parties may want to clarify which laws apply to which specific issues within the agreement.

In summary, the clause you provided is relevant as it sets the foundation for the governing law, and it can be adapted to incorporate multiple governing laws by specifying which laws apply to different parts of the agreement or different types of disputes. This ensures clarity and helps prevent conflicts that may arise from the application of different legal standards.",4

This is relevant to the query about clauses with multiple governing laws because it establishes a clear legal framework for interpreting and enforcing the agreement, while also indicating that the parties do not wish to incorporate conflicting laws from other jurisdictions.

In the context of the external information provided, which includes clauses discussing enforcement, jurisdiction, and remedies, the clause you provided serves to clarify which jurisdiction's laws will apply in the event of a dispute. This is particularly important in contracts where parties may be located in different jurisdictions or where the subject matter of the contract may involve multiple legal systems.

The relevance lies in the fact that while the clause specifies New York law as the governing law, it implicitly acknowledges the potential for multiple jurisdictions to be involved (hence the exclusion of laws directing the application of another jurisdiction's law). This aligns with the themes in the external clauses, which discuss the importance of jurisdiction and the remedies available in the event of a breach, emphasizing the need for clarity in legal agreements to avoid complications arising from conflicting laws. 

Overall, the clause is a critical component in ensuring that the parties have a mutual understanding of the legal framework that will govern their agreement, thereby reducing the risk of disputes related to jurisdictional issues.",5
Clause with multiple governing laws,135342ef61,"This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its principles regarding conflicts of law.

This means that any legal disputes arising from the Warrant will be interpreted and enforced according to New York law, regardless of any conflicting laws from other jurisdictions.

It clarifies that the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, which further reinforces the exclusivity of New York law in interpreting the Warrant.

In contrast, a clause with multiple governing laws would typically specify different jurisdictions or legal frameworks that could apply to different aspects of the agreement or in different circumstances. The provided clause does not reflect that complexity; instead, it simplifies the legal framework by designating a single governing law and jurisdiction, which can help avoid confusion and potential legal disputes over which laws apply. 

Overall, while the clause does not illustrate multiple governing laws, it serves as a clear example of how to establish a singular governing law and jurisdiction, which is a common practice in legal agreements to ensure clarity and consistency.",5

In the context of your query regarding clauses with multiple governing laws, this clause is relevant because it highlights the importance of clearly defining the governing law for the agreement. However, it does not explicitly mention multiple governing laws. 

To address the concept of multiple governing laws, a clause could be structured to specify different governing laws for different aspects of the agreement or for different parties involved. For example, it could state that New York law governs the interpretation of the agreement, while another jurisdiction's law governs specific transactions or obligations arising from the agreement.

The external information you provided includes examples of clauses that discuss jurisdiction and remedies, which may imply the application of different laws in specific contexts (e.g., Delaware courts for enforcement). These examples illustrate how parties can navigate complex legal landscapes by specifying different governing laws or jurisdictions for various aspects of their agreement, which is a key consideration when drafting contracts that may involve multiple legal frameworks. 

In summary, while the provided clause establishes a single governing law (New York), it serves as a foundation for understanding how to approach the inclusion of multiple governing laws in a contract, which can be crucial for ensuring clarity and enforceability in complex agreements.",3

However, it does not explicitly mention multiple governing laws; rather, it focuses solely on Delaware law. 

In the context of the external information provided, both excerpts discuss the enforcement of rights and remedies and the jurisdiction for legal actions, emphasizing the importance of specific jurisdictions (Delaware courts) for resolving disputes. The clause you provided aligns with this theme by designating Delaware law as the governing law, which is consistent with the jurisdictional focus seen in the external examples. 

If the intention is to incorporate multiple governing laws, the clause would need to explicitly state that different aspects of the agreement may be governed by different jurisdictions, which is not the case here. Therefore, while the clause is relevant in establishing a governing law, it does not address the concept of multiple governing laws directly.",4

3. **Clarity and Certainty**: The clause provides clarity and certainty to the parties involved by establishing a specific jurisdiction (California) and legal framework. This can help avoid disputes over which laws apply and can streamline the resolution of any legal issues that arise under the agreement.

4. **Potential for Equitable Remedies**: The external information you provided discusses the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctions and specific performance.

This means that any legal disputes arising from the agreement will be interpreted and enforced according to California's legal standards, rather than those of another jurisdiction.

2. **Exclusion of UCC**: By stating that the agreement is governed by California law without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws, the clause implicitly suggests that the parties do not intend to apply the UCC or similar regulatory frameworks that might typically govern commercial transactions. The UCC is a set of laws that standardizes transactions of goods and is often applicable in commercial agreements. By excluding it, the parties may be indicating that they want to avoid the complexities and specific provisions of the UCC, which may not align with their intentions for the agreement.

3. **Focus on State Law**: The clause emphasizes reliance on state law (California law) rather than federal law or uniform codes, which aligns with the request to exclude UCC or similar frameworks. This can be particularly important in contracts where the parties wish to have more control over the legal principles that apply to their agreement.

4. **Legal Certainty**: By specifying California law, the parties may seek to ensure that they are operating under a familiar legal framework, which can provide clarity and predictability in the enforcement of the agreement.

While it does not directly address the governing law or the exclusion of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or similar regulatory frameworks, it is relevant to the query in the following ways:

1. **Intellectual Property Rights**: The clause outlines the rights of the franchisor to use and license Proprietary Marks, which is a critical aspect of franchise agreements. Understanding how these rights are governed is essential, especially in jurisdictions where specific laws may apply to intellectual property.

2. **Governing Law Implications**: The governing law clause in a contract typically specifies which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the agreement. If the governing law excludes the UCC or similar frameworks, it may indicate that the parties intend to rely on common law principles or specific state laws that govern intellectual property and franchise agreements. This could affect how the rights and obligations outlined in the clause are interpreted and enforced.

3. **Non-Exclusive Rights**: The clause states that the rights granted are non-exclusive, which may have implications under the governing law. If the governing law does not recognize certain types of exclusivity or has specific requirements for licensing agreements, it could impact the enforceability of the rights described.

4. **Approval for Use**: The requirement for prior written approval for the use of concepts, methods, techniques, or products may also be influenced by the governing law. If the governing law excludes certain regulatory frameworks, it may affect how such approvals are managed and what constitutes a breach of the agreement.

In summary, while the clause itself does not explicitly mention governing law or the UCC, it is relevant because the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and obligations it describes will be influenced by the governing law specified in the contract, especially if that law excludes certain regulatory frameworks.

This means that any legal disputes arising from the Agreement will be interpreted and resolved according to California state law, rather than federal law or the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).

2. **Exclusion of UCC**: By specifying that the Agreement is governed by California law without reference to the UCC or similar regulatory frameworks, the clause indicates that the parties do not intend for the UCC to apply to their Agreement. This is significant because the UCC governs commercial transactions and could otherwise influence the interpretation of the Agreement if applicable.

3. **Conflict of Law Principles**: The clause also states that it is without reference to choice or conflict of law principles. This means that the parties are agreeing to apply California law directly, without considering any potential conflicts with laws from other jurisdictions that might otherwise apply. This further reinforces the intent to exclude the UCC and similar frameworks that could arise from such conflicts.

4. **Legal Certainty**: By clearly stating the governing law, the parties aim to provide legal certainty and predictability regarding how the Agreement will be enforced and interpreted, which is particularly important in contractual relationships.

While this clause does not directly address a Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause, it is relevant in the context of legal interpretation and enforcement of such clauses. An MFN clause typically ensures that a party receives terms that are at least as favorable as those offered to any other party in similar circumstances. The governing law clause indicates which jurisdiction's laws will apply to interpret and enforce the terms of the agreement, including any MFN provisions.

In the event of a dispute regarding the MFN clause, the laws of California will dictate how the clause is interpreted, what remedies are available, and how the parties can enforce their rights. This is particularly important because different jurisdictions may have varying interpretations and enforceability standards for MFN clauses. Therefore, understanding the governing law is crucial for the parties to know their rights and obligations under the MFN clause and the overall agreement.

While this clause does not directly address a Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause, it is relevant in the context of how the MFN clause would be interpreted and enforced. An MFN clause typically ensures that a party receives terms that are at least as favorable as those offered to any other party in similar circumstances. The governing law clause indicates that any disputes regarding the interpretation or enforcement of the MFN clause (or any other provisions of the agreement) will be resolved according to California law.

In practical terms, if a party were to invoke the MFN clause, the interpretation of what constitutes ""most favored"" terms, as well as the enforcement of those terms, would be subject to California's legal standards and precedents. This could affect how courts in California would handle disputes related to the MFN clause, including the remedies available for breaches of that clause.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly mention the MFN clause, it establishes the legal framework within which the MFN clause would be analyzed and enforced, making it relevant to the query.",3
Most Favored Nation Clause,829065c4f5,"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without reference to its conflict or choice of law rules or principles.

In the context of a Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause, which typically ensures that one party receives terms that are at least as favorable as those offered to any other party, the governing law is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Interpretation of the MFN Clause**: The governing law will dictate how the MFN clause is interpreted and enforced. Different jurisdictions may have varying legal standards and interpretations regarding contract terms, including MFN clauses. Therefore, specifying the governing law helps to establish a clear framework for how the MFN clause will be applied.

2. **Enforcement Mechanisms**: The clause also relates to the enforcement of the MFN provision. If a party believes that the MFN clause has been violated, the governing law will determine the available remedies and the process for seeking enforcement, such as whether the party can seek an injunction or specific performance.

3. **Jurisdictional Considerations**: The choice of governing law can affect which courts have jurisdiction over disputes arising from the agreement. This is particularly relevant if the parties are located in different states or countries, as it can influence where legal actions can be initiated and how they will be resolved.

4. **Conflict of Laws**: By excluding conflict of laws provisions, the clause aims to prevent complications that could arise from differing laws in various jurisdictions. This is particularly important for MFN clauses, as they may involve comparisons of terms across different agreements that could be governed by different laws.

In summary, while the clause itself does not directly mention a Most Favored Nation clause, it is relevant because it establishes the legal framework within which the MFN clause will be interpreted, enforced, and litigated, thereby impacting the rights and obligations of the parties involved.",4

If a dispute arises regarding the application or enforcement of an MFN clause, the jurisdiction and governing law specified in your clause would dictate where and how that dispute would be resolved.

Here’s how the clause is relevant:

1. **Jurisdiction**: The clause specifies that any legal action related to the agreement, including disputes over the MFN clause, must be brought in the federal and state courts of North Carolina. This means that if one party believes the other has violated the MFN clause, they would need to file their case in North Carolina.

2. **Governing Law**: The clause states that the agreement will be governed by the laws of North Carolina. This is important because the interpretation and enforcement of the MFN clause would be subject to North Carolina law, which may have specific legal precedents or statutes that affect how such clauses are treated.

3. **Dispute Resolution**: The clause indicates that any disputes will be resolved in accordance with the specified jurisdiction and governing law, which is crucial for parties to understand their rights and obligations under the MFN clause.

An MFN clause typically ensures that a party receives terms that are at least as favorable as those offered to any other party in similar circumstances. 

Here’s how the clause relates to the MFN concept:

1. **Governing Law**: The clause establishes that any disputes regarding the interpretation or enforcement of the MFN clause (if included in the agreement) will be governed by British Columbia law. This is important because the interpretation of what constitutes ""most favored"" terms can vary by jurisdiction.

2. **Jurisdiction**: By attorning to the courts of British Columbia, the parties agree that any legal challenges or enforcement actions related to the MFN clause will be handled in that jurisdiction. This can affect how the MFN clause is enforced, as different jurisdictions may have different precedents or interpretations regarding such clauses.

3. **Dispute Resolution**: If a dispute arises regarding whether one party has been granted more favorable terms than another, the jurisdiction specified in this clause will be where such disputes are resolved. This can impact the strategy and considerations of the parties involved in negotiations or potential litigation regarding the MFN clause.

1. **Termination by Customer**: The clause specifies that the Customer has the right to terminate the Agreement in whole or in part under certain sections (7.3, 7.4, 7.5, or 7.6). This aligns with the idea of ""Termination for Convenience,"" where one party can terminate the contract without cause, typically with prior notice.

2. **Inventory and Business Continuity**: Upon termination, the Manufacturer is required to provide sufficient inventory of the terminated Product to ensure business continuity. This provision is crucial as it allows the Customer to maintain operations while transitioning to a new supplier, which is a common concern in termination scenarios.

3. **Purchase of Work in Process and Product Materials**: The clause allows the Customer to purchase any work in process and Product Materials that were exclusively purchased for them. This is significant because it ensures that the Customer can retain necessary resources even after termination, which is a protective measure often included in termination clauses.

4. **Disposal of Quarantined Products**: The clause outlines the responsibilities regarding quarantined products, indicating that the Manufacturer may incur costs if the quarantine is due to their negligence. This aspect emphasizes the importance of accountability in the termination process.

5. **Technical Support and Transition**: The clause also mentions the provision of Technical Support during the transition period, which is essential for a smooth handover to a new supplier. This reflects a commitment to assist the Customer even after the termination of the Agreement.

1. **Termination by Customer**: The clause specifies that the Customer has the right to terminate the Agreement in whole or in part under certain sections (7.3, 7.4, 7.5, or 7.6). This aligns with the idea of ""Termination for Convenience,"" where one party can terminate the contract without cause, typically with prior notice.

2. **Inventory and Business Continuity**: Upon termination, the Manufacturer is required to provide sufficient inventory of the terminated Product to ensure business continuity. This provision is crucial for the Customer to maintain operations even after the termination, which is a common concern in termination for convenience scenarios.

3. **Purchase of Work in Process and Product Materials**: The clause allows the Customer to purchase any work in process and/or Product Materials that were exclusively purchased for them. This is significant because it ensures that the Customer can continue their operations without interruption, which is often a key consideration in termination for convenience clauses.

4. **Disposal of Quarantined Products**: The clause outlines the responsibilities regarding quarantined products upon termination, indicating that the Manufacturer may bear costs if the quarantine is due to their negligence. This aspect is important in termination scenarios as it addresses liability and cost implications.

5. **Technical Support and Transition**: The clause also mentions the provision of Technical Support during the transition period after termination, which is essential for the Customer to smoothly transfer production to another supplier or facility. This is a common requirement in termination for convenience clauses to ensure that the terminating party is not left without support.

6. **Notification of Facility Disposition**: The requirement for the Manufacturer to notify the Customer of any Facility Disposition and the Customer's rights to terminate the Facility Addendum for cause is relevant as it provides the Customer with options to protect their interests in the event of significant changes in the Manufacturer's operations.

Overall, this clause provides a comprehensive framework for the rights and obligations of both parties upon termination, particularly from the Customer's perspective, which is essential in the context of termination for convenience. It ensures that the Customer can mitigate risks and maintain continuity in their operations, which is a primary concern in such termination scenarios.",5

This is relevant to the query about ""Termination for Convenience"" because it explicitly defines the rights of the parties to terminate the agreement without cause, which is a key aspect of termination for convenience clauses.

Here’s how the clause relates to the concept of termination for convenience:

1. **Right to Terminate**: The clause grants the Company the right to terminate any Transition Service and RGHI the right to terminate any Reverse Transition Service for convenience, meaning they do not need to provide a specific reason for the termination.

2. **Notice Requirement**: It specifies that a 30-day prior written notice must be given before such termination can take effect. This is a common requirement in termination for convenience clauses to ensure that the other party has adequate time to prepare for the termination.

3. **Conditions and Exceptions**: The clause includes specific conditions regarding the termination of certain services (e.g., those described in Section G1 of Exhibit A), indicating that some services may have restrictions on termination. This is important because it clarifies that not all services can be terminated at will, which is a common limitation in termination for convenience clauses.

4. **Financial Implications**: The clause also addresses the financial aspect of termination, stating that any unamortized costs incurred specifically for providing the services will be passed through to the terminating party. This is relevant because it outlines the financial consequences of exercising the termination right, which is often a consideration in termination for convenience scenarios.

Overall, this clause provides a clear framework for how termination for convenience can be executed, including notice requirements, exceptions, and financial implications, making it a relevant and important part of the contract.",5
Termination for Convenience,494bebe771,"Customer acknowledges that the Termination for Convenience Fee and the Termination for Cause Fee are each a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty. If M&I terminates this Agreement following an Event of Default on the part of Customer, or if Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1 above without complying with the notification requirements set forth in Section 11.1, then Customer shall pay M&I a termination fee (""Termination for Cause Fee"") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value, payable as set forth in Section 11.1 above. Customer may terminate this Agreement during the Term upon at least one (1) years' written notice to M&I, provided that Customer pays M&I an early termination fee (""Termination for Convenience Fee"") in an amount equal to REDACTED of the Estimated Remaining Value.","The clause provided is directly relevant to the query regarding ""Termination for Convenience"" as it outlines the conditions and implications of such a termination within the context of the agreement.

1. **Definition of Termination for Convenience**: The clause specifies that the Customer has the right to terminate the agreement during the term by providing at least one year's written notice to M&I. This aligns with the concept of ""Termination for Convenience,"" which allows a party to exit a contract without cause, typically with prior notice.

2. **Termination for Convenience Fee**: The clause mentions a ""Termination for Convenience Fee,"" which the Customer must pay to M&I upon exercising this right. This fee is described as a reasonable approximation of damages and is categorized as liquidated damages rather than a penalty. This is important because it clarifies that the fee is pre-determined and agreed upon by both parties, which is a common practice in contracts to avoid disputes over damages.

3. **Comparison with Termination for Cause**: The clause also contrasts the ""Termination for Convenience Fee"" with the ""Termination for Cause Fee."" The latter applies if the Customer terminates the agreement following an Event of Default or fails to comply with notification requirements. This distinction is crucial as it highlights the different financial implications and conditions under which the agreement can be terminated.

4. **Implications of Early Termination**: By specifying the requirement of a fee for early termination, the clause serves to protect M&I's interests and provides a financial framework for the Customer's decision to terminate the agreement. This is a common feature in contracts to ensure that the terminating party compensates the other for the potential loss of expected benefits from the contract.

In summary, this clause provides a clear framework for how the Customer can terminate the agreement for convenience, the associated financial obligations, and the rationale behind these provisions, making it highly relevant to the query about termination for convenience.",5

1. **Time Restriction**: The clause specifies a non-competition period of two (2) years after the termination or expiration of the agreement. This aligns with the query's focus on the time aspect of non-compete agreements, indicating that the individual (and their principal owners and family members) must refrain from engaging in competitive business activities for a defined duration.

2. **Territory Restriction**: The clause also imposes a geographical limitation, stating that the non-compete applies within a radius of twenty-five (25) miles from the Franchise Premises or any other franchise location of The Joint Corp. This territorial restriction is a critical component of non-compete agreements, as it defines the area in which the individual is prohibited from competing.

3. **Scope of Activities**: The clause further clarifies the scope of the non-compete by stating that the individual cannot perform services for or have any interest in businesses that offer products or services similar to those of The Joint Corp.

This indicates that while the parties are restricted from competing globally, they are allowed to operate in India, thus defining the territorial limits of the non-compete agreement.

3. **Scope of Activities**: The clause details the specific activities that are prohibited during the Non-Compete Period, such as owning, managing, operating, or controlling any business that competes with the Combined Business, as well as being involved with any entity engaged in such business.

Here’s how it relates to the query regarding non-compete agreements:

1. **Time Bound**: The clause specifies a ""Restricted Period,"" which indicates a defined timeframe during which the individual is prohibited from engaging in competitive activities. This aligns with the query's focus on the temporal aspect of non-compete agreements, as it establishes a clear duration for the restrictions.

2. **Territory Bound**: The term ""Restricted Territory"" is used to define the geographical area where the individual is restricted from competing with the Company or any Group Company. This is a critical component of non-compete clauses, as it delineates the scope of the restriction in terms of location, ensuring that the individual cannot engage in competitive activities within a specified area.

3. **Scope of Competition**: The clause outlines specific activities that are prohibited during the Restricted Period and within the Restricted Territory, such as being employed by competitors, transacting business with certain customers, soliciting customers, and enticing away employees.

While it does not explicitly mention a non-compete agreement, it is relevant to the query about non-compete clauses bound by time and territory in the following ways:

1. **Territorial Exclusivity**: The clause indicates that if Hydraspin decides to enter a new territory, it must first offer the Distributor the opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for that territory. This implies a form of territorial restriction, which is a key element in non-compete agreements. Non-compete clauses often specify that a party cannot engage in certain activities (like distribution) in a defined geographic area for a certain period.

2. **Time Frame for Agreement**: The clause sets a time limit of ten (10) business days for the parties to reach an agreement on exclusivity. This time-bound aspect is also a common feature in non-compete agreements, which often specify a duration during which the restrictions apply.

3. **Implications of Non-Agreement**: The clause states that if the parties cannot agree within the specified time, Hydraspin has no obligation to contract with the Distributor for the new territory. This could imply that if the Distributor does not secure exclusivity, they may be at risk of competition from Hydraspin or other distributors in that territory, which aligns with the concerns typically addressed in non-compete clauses.

While it does not explicitly mention a non-compete agreement, it is relevant to the query about non-compete clauses bound by time and territory in the following ways:

1. **Territorial Scope**: The clause specifies that if Hydraspin wishes to enter a new territory in the United States, it must first offer the Distributor the opportunity to become the exclusive distributor for that territory. This implies a territorial limitation on the Distributor's rights and responsibilities, which is a common feature in non-compete agreements. It suggests that the Distributor may be restricted from competing in that specific territory unless they are granted exclusivity.

2. **Time Frame for Agreement**: The clause includes a time frame of ten (10) business days for the parties to reach an agreement on the terms of exclusivity. This time-bound aspect is also a characteristic of non-compete clauses, which often specify a duration during which the parties must adhere to the terms of the agreement. If an agreement is not reached within this time frame, Hydraspin is not obligated to contract with the Distributor, which could affect the Distributor's ability to compete in that territory.

3. **Implications for Non-Compete**: Although the clause does not directly state a non-compete obligation, the exclusivity offered to the Distributor can be seen as a form of non-compete arrangement. If the Distributor does not secure the exclusive rights, they may be limited in their ability to operate in that territory, which aligns with the principles of non-compete agreements that restrict competition within defined parameters.

This includes the remedies available in case of a breach, such as injunctions or specific performance, as highlighted in the external information.

3. **Conflict of Law Principles**: The clause explicitly states that it will not give effect to conflict of law principles. This means that the parties have agreed to adhere strictly to the laws of the chosen state, which can impact how exclusivity is treated, especially if the parties are located in different jurisdictions.

4. **Implications for Irreparable Harm**: The external information discusses the concept of irreparable harm and the right to seek equitable relief (like injunctions) in the event of a breach.

The reference to the termination of the Agreement and the immediate termination of the Tail Period if certain conditions are met indicates that the exclusivity is not indefinite but rather bound by specific time constraints.

3. **Territory**: The term ""Territory"" is explicitly mentioned, indicating that the exclusivity is geographically limited. This means that Valeant's rights and obligations under the Agreement are confined to a particular area, reinforcing the territorial aspect of the exclusivity.

No-Solicit of Customers,87addb8ad7,"Each of SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings agrees not to solicit or hire any employee of the other party during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed to employees of other party (or employment of applicants to such solicitations).","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding ""No-Solicit of Customers"" because it establishes a mutual agreement between two parties (SMBC/Nikko and Moelis Holdings) not to solicit or hire each other's employees. This is a form of non-solicitation agreement, which is a common provision in contracts to protect the interests of both parties by preventing the poaching of key personnel.

In the context of the broader topic of no-solicitation clauses, the clause serves to:

1. **Protect Human Resources**: By preventing either party from soliciting or hiring employees from the other, the clause helps maintain the stability and integrity of each party's workforce. This is particularly important in industries where talent is a critical asset.

4. **Time Frame**: The clause includes a defined time frame (during the term of the Agreement and for 12 months thereafter), which is a common practice in non-solicitation agreements to ensure that the restriction is not indefinite.

Overall, while the clause specifically addresses the solicitation of employees rather than customers, it reflects the same underlying principle of protecting business interests and maintaining fair practices in competitive environments. In the context of customer solicitation, similar principles would apply, where parties agree not to solicit each other's customers to prevent unfair competition and protect business relationships.",2
No-Solicit of Customers,77df66b5ca,"Each Party agrees that, during the [***] ([***]) [***] period starting from the Effective Date, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates or otherwise induce or attempt to induce such employees to terminate their employment with such other Party or such other Party's Affiliates; provided, however, that general public solicitations and advertisements not directed at employees of the other Party, and the extension of offers to persons who respond to such general solicitations and advertisements, will not be deemed violations of this provision.","The clause provided is relevant to the query regarding the ""No-Solicit of Customers"" because it outlines a specific agreement between the parties involved in the contract that restricts them from soliciting each other's employees. While the clause explicitly addresses employee solicitation, it reflects a broader principle of non-solicitation that can also apply to customers.

1. **Non-Solicitation Principle**: The clause establishes a framework where one party agrees not to solicit or induce the employees of the other party to leave their employment. This principle can be extended to customers, where a similar clause would prevent one party from soliciting the customers of the other party.

2. **Protection of Business Relationships**: Just as the clause aims to protect the workforce of each party, a ""No-Solicit of Customers"" clause would aim to protect the business relationships and customer bases of each party. It prevents one party from undermining the other’s business by enticing away its customers.

3. **Time Frame and Scope**: The clause specifies a time frame during which the non-solicitation obligation is in effect. This is a common feature in non-solicitation agreements, including those related to customers, ensuring that the parties are bound by these restrictions for a defined period.

4. **Exceptions**: The clause includes exceptions for general public solicitations and advertisements, which is a common feature in non-solicitation clauses. A similar exception could be included in a ""No-Solicit of Customers"" clause to allow for general marketing efforts that do not target the other party's customers directly.

In summary, while the clause specifically addresses employee solicitation, it embodies the same principles that would apply to a ""No-Solicit of Customers"" clause, emphasizing the importance of protecting business relationships and ensuring fair competition between the parties.",3
No-Solicit of Customers,0b81bda9eb,"Consultant will not, during the Term, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, directly or indirectly:<omitted>(ii) solicit, participate in or promote the solicitation of any of the Company's clients, customers, or prospective customers with whom Consultant had a Material Contact (hereinafter defined) and/or regarding whom Consultant received Confidential Information, for the purpose of providing products or services (""Competitive Products/Services"").","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding ""No-Solicit of Customers"" as it outlines specific restrictions placed on a consultant concerning the solicitation of the company's clients, customers, or prospective customers. Here’s how it connects to the query:

1. **Scope of Restriction**: The clause explicitly states that the consultant is prohibited from soliciting any of the company's clients, customers, or prospective customers during the term of the agreement and for one year thereafter. This aligns with the general purpose of a ""No-Solicit"" clause, which is to protect the company's business relationships and prevent the consultant from leveraging those relationships for competitive advantage after the termination of their engagement.

2. **Material Contact and Confidential Information**: The clause specifies that the restriction applies to clients, customers, or prospective customers with whom the consultant had ""Material Contact"" and regarding whom the consultant received ""Confidential Information."" This is significant because it narrows the scope of the restriction to those relationships that the consultant had a direct involvement with, thereby focusing on protecting the company's sensitive information and business interests.

3. **Competitive Products/Services**: The clause also mentions that the solicitation is specifically for the purpose of providing ""Competitive Products/Services."" This indicates that the restriction is not just a blanket prohibition on all solicitation but is specifically aimed at preventing the consultant from competing with the company in the same market or industry.

4. **Duration of Restriction**: The one-year duration after the term of the agreement is a common timeframe in non-solicitation clauses, providing a reasonable period for the company to protect its business interests without unduly restricting the consultant's future opportunities.

In summary, this clause serves to protect the company's customer relationships and confidential information from being exploited by the consultant after their engagement ends, which is the essence of a ""No-Solicit of Customers"" provision.",5
No-Solicit of Customers,34cf501a88,"Distributor shall be entitled to advertise, promote, market or<omitted>solicit any Customers that have a business presence outside the Territory, except that Distributor shall not conduct solicitation activities in any outside territory where Hydraspin is bound to an exclusive distributor agreement with a third party, provided that Hydraspin has notified Distributor in writing of its arrangements with the other distributor and of the territory which is subject to exclusivity in favor of the other distributor.","The clause you provided outlines the conditions under which a distributor is allowed to solicit customers, specifically focusing on the geographical limitations of such solicitation activities. Here’s how it relates to the query regarding ""No-Solicit of Customers"":

1. **Scope of Solicitation**: The clause specifies that the distributor can solicit customers outside a defined ""Territory."" This is relevant to the concept of ""No-Solicit"" because it establishes boundaries for solicitation activities, indicating that the distributor is restricted from soliciting customers in certain areas where exclusivity agreements exist.

2. **Exclusivity Agreements**: The clause mentions that the distributor cannot conduct solicitation activities in territories where Hydraspin (the company) has an exclusive distributor agreement with another party. This aligns with the principles of ""No-Solicit"" clauses, which often aim to protect existing business relationships and prevent competition in designated areas.

3. **Notification Requirement**: The requirement for Hydraspin to notify the distributor in writing about its exclusive arrangements is a common practice in ""No-Solicit"" agreements. It ensures that the distributor is aware of the limitations on its solicitation activities, thereby preventing unintentional breaches of exclusivity.

4. **Implications for Breach**: If the distributor were to solicit customers in a territory where it is prohibited due to an exclusive agreement, it could lead to a breach of contract. This is similar to the consequences outlined in ""No-Solicit"" clauses, where violations can result in legal repercussions.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the ""No-Solicit of Customers"" query as it establishes the framework for permissible solicitation activities, outlines restrictions based on exclusivity agreements, and emphasizes the importance of communication regarding those restrictions.",5
No-Solicit of Customers,ae1ddd57be,"Notwithstanding the above, Sellers shall not be restricted from (1) soliciting for employment or hiring former employees of Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) whose employment was terminated by Buyer or the Company (including their respective subsidiaries) at least six months prior to such initial solicitation by such Seller or (2) soliciting employees of the Combined Business by means of a general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing that is not specifically targeted at employees or former<omitted>employees of the Combined Business; provided, however, that this clause (2) shall not permit any Seller to hire any such employees during the Non-Solicit Period. Each Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending three years after the Closing Date (the ""Non-Solicit Period""), each Seller shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) induce, solicit, recruit or attempt to persuade any employee of the Combined Business to terminate his or her employment with the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) solicit the employment of any of the employees of the Combined Business.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding ""No-Solicit of Customers"" as it outlines the restrictions placed on Sellers concerning the solicitation of employees from the Combined Business, which includes the Buyer and its subsidiaries. While the query specifically mentions customers, the principles of non-solicitation can be similarly applied to employees, as both involve the protection of business interests and relationships.

Here’s how the clause relates to the query:

1. **Non-Solicitation Period**: The clause establishes a ""Non-Solicit Period"" of three years after the Closing Date during which Sellers are prohibited from soliciting employees of the Combined Business. This is akin to a no-solicitation agreement that aims to protect the business from losing key personnel to competitors or former partners.

2. **Scope of Restrictions**: The clause specifies that Sellers cannot induce or solicit employees to leave their employment with the Buyer or its subsidiaries. This mirrors the intent behind no-solicitation clauses for customers, which is to prevent one party from poaching the other’s business relationships.

3. **Exceptions**: The clause provides exceptions for soliciting former employees who were terminated at least six months prior, and for general solicitations that are not targeted. This is similar to how no-solicitation clauses for customers might allow for certain types of outreach that do not directly target the customers of the other party.

4. **Protection of Business Interests**: Both the employee and customer no-solicitation clauses serve to protect the business interests of the Buyer and the Combined Business. By restricting solicitation, the clause aims to maintain stability and continuity within the workforce and customer base, which is crucial for the success of the business post-transaction.

In summary, while the clause specifically addresses the solicitation of employees, the underlying principles of protecting business relationships and interests are directly relevant to the concept of no-solicitation of customers. Both types of clauses are designed to prevent competitive harm and ensure that the parties involved respect each other's business operations during and after the term of the agreement.",3

1. **Duration of the No-Solicitation Clause**: The clause specifies a time period during which the parties agree not to solicit each other's employees. Your query mentions a desire for a no-solicitation clause that is ""not bound by time or longer than 12 months."" The clause you provided, however, explicitly states a defined period (indicated by ""[***]"") during which the no-solicitation obligation is in effect. This is contrary to your request for a clause that is not bound by time.

2. **Scope of the Clause**: The clause prohibits direct or indirect solicitation of employees, which aligns with the general purpose of no-solicitation agreements. It aims to protect each party's workforce from being poached by the other. This is relevant to your query as it highlights the common elements found in no-solicitation clauses.

3. **Exceptions**: The clause includes exceptions for general public solicitations and advertisements, which is a common feature in no-solicitation agreements. This means that if a party advertises for employees in a general manner (not targeting the other party's employees), it would not be considered a violation of the no-solicitation provision. This aspect may be important to consider if you are looking for flexibility in how the no-solicitation clause is structured.

In summary, while the clause you provided serves as a standard no-solicitation agreement, it does not meet your specific request for a clause that is not bound by time or is longer than 12 months. If you are looking to draft or negotiate a no-solicitation clause, you may want to consider removing the time limitation or specifying a longer duration to align with your requirements.",3

Here’s how this clause is relevant to your query regarding a ""No-Solicit Of Employees"" provision that is not bound by time or longer than 12 months:

1. **Duration of Non-Solicit Period**: The clause establishes a Non-Solicit Period of three years, which exceeds the 12-month limit you mentioned. This indicates that the clause does not align with your query's requirement for a shorter duration.

2. **Scope of Solicitation**: The clause allows Sellers to solicit former employees of the Buyer or the Company if their employment was terminated at least six months prior to the solicitation. This provision provides some flexibility but still imposes restrictions on soliciting current employees during the Non-Solicit Period.

3. **General Solicitation Exception**: The clause includes an exception for general solicitations through public mediums, which means that Sellers can still reach out to potential employees broadly, as long as it is not targeted specifically at employees of the Combined Business. This aspect could be relevant if you are considering how to structure a no-solicitation clause that allows for some level of recruitment without direct targeting.

4. **Comparison to Your Query**: Your query seeks a no-solicit clause that is not bound by time or is limited to 12 months. The clause provided is significantly longer (three years) and includes specific conditions that may not meet your needs for flexibility or duration.

In summary, while the clause provides a framework for employee solicitation restrictions, it does not align with your query's specifications regarding duration and flexibility. If you are looking for a no-solicit clause that is not bound by time or is limited to 12 months, you may need to draft a new clause that reflects those requirements.",3

Here’s how it relates to the query:

1. **Time Limitation**: The clause explicitly states that the no-solicitation agreement is in effect during the term of the agreement and for a period of 12 months thereafter. This aligns with the query's mention of a time-bound restriction, as it specifies a clear duration (12 months) for which the parties are prohibited from soliciting each other's employees.

2. **Scope of Restriction**: The clause also clarifies that the restriction does not apply to general solicitations to the public that are not specifically directed at the employees of the other party. This is an important aspect of no-solicitation clauses, as it allows for some flexibility in hiring practices while still protecting the interests of both parties.

3. **Comparison to Query**: The query suggests a desire for a no-solicitation clause that is either not bound by time or longer than 12 months. The provided clause, however, imposes a specific 12-month limit, which may not fully align with the query's intent if the goal is to have no time limitation at all.

In summary, while the clause provides a clear example of a no-solicitation agreement with a defined time frame, it does not meet the criteria of being ""not bound by time"" as requested in the query. Instead, it serves as a standard reference for how such clauses are typically structured, including the duration and exceptions.",3

1. **Duration of the Non-Solicit Period**: The clause specifies a Non-Solicit Period of three years, which exceeds the 12-month limit you mentioned in your query. This indicates that the clause does not align with your request for a restriction that is not longer than 12 months.

2. **Scope of Restrictions**: The clause prohibits Sellers from inducing or soliciting employees of the Combined Business to leave their employment for a significant duration.

3. **Exceptions to the No-Solicit Clause**: The clause does provide exceptions, allowing Sellers to solicit former employees who were terminated at least six months prior to the solicitation or to engage in general solicitations that are not specifically targeted. This could be relevant if you are considering a more flexible approach to the no-solicit terms.

In summary, the clause you provided is relevant to your query as it exemplifies a no-solicit agreement that is significantly longer than the 12-month period you are interested in.

1. **Duration of Non-Solicitation**: The clause specifies a non-solicitation period of five years, which exceeds the 12-month limit mentioned in your query. This indicates that the clause is not compliant with the request for a non-solicitation period that is not longer than 12 months.

2. **Scope of Restriction**: The clause restricts both direct and indirect solicitation of current or previous employees, which aligns with the general intent of a no-solicitation clause. However, the extended duration makes it potentially more burdensome than what you are seeking.

3. **Consent Requirement**: The clause also includes a provision that allows for solicitation if a certain period (in this case, sixty months) has elapsed since the employee was last employed.

1. **Scope of Non-Disparagement**: The clause explicitly states that neither party, nor their representatives, shall publicly disparage or defame the other party or its representatives. This includes a wide range of communication methods, such as written, oral, or electronic statements, and covers various platforms like media interviews or reports filed with regulatory bodies (e.g., the SEC).

2. **Protection of Reputation**: The clause aims to protect the business and reputation of both parties by prohibiting any statements that could reasonably be construed as damaging. This is crucial in maintaining a positive public image and avoiding potential harm to business relationships.

3. **Exceptions**: The clause includes a provision that allows for disclosures related to litigation or arbitration proceedings. This means that while the parties are restricted from disparaging each other in general, they are permitted to discuss facts related to legal disputes, which is a common exception in non-disparagement clauses.

4. **Broad Definition of Representatives**: The clause defines ""Representatives"" broadly, encompassing not just the parties themselves but also their subsidiaries, affiliates, and key personnel. This ensures that the non-disparagement obligation extends to a wide network of individuals associated with the parties, further reinforcing the intent to protect reputations.

5. **Legal Compliance**: The clause is subject to applicable law, indicating that the non-disparagement obligations must comply with legal standards, which is important for enforceability.

2. **Scope of Communication**: The clause specifies that the prohibition on disparaging comments applies to all forms of communication, whether written or oral, and extends to third parties, including customers, suppliers, and competitors. This broad scope is typical in non-disparagement agreements to ensure that any potential negative impact on the other party's reputation is minimized.

3. **Duration of Obligation**: The clause states that the non-disparagement obligation lasts during the term of the agreement and for two years thereafter. This is a common practice in non-disparagement clauses, as it provides a defined period during which the parties must adhere to these obligations.

4. **Preventive Measures**: The clause also includes a provision that requires each party to use reasonable commercial efforts to prevent their employees from making disparaging communications. This adds an additional layer of responsibility, ensuring that the obligation is not only personal but also extends to the actions of employees.

This type of clause is designed to prevent the parties involved—in this case, the Client and the Designer—from making negative statements about each other.

1. **Mutual Agreement**: The clause establishes a mutual commitment between the Client and the Designer not to disparage each other. This is a key element of non-disparagement agreements, which typically require both parties to refrain from negative comments.

2. **Scope of Disparagement**: The clause specifies that disparagement includes speaking ill of the other party and posting negative comments online. This broad definition ensures that both parties understand the extent of the non-disparagement obligation, covering various forms of communication.

3. **Prevention of Disparagement by Agents**: The clause also includes a provision that requires both parties to take reasonable steps to prevent their employees or agents from making disparaging remarks. This is important because it extends the non-disparagement obligation beyond just the parties involved to include their representatives.

4. **Prohibition on Defamatory Posts**: The clause explicitly prohibits posting negative comments on defamatory or review websites, which reinforces the commitment to maintain a positive public image and avoid damaging statements.

The clause you provided emphasizes the need for mutual consent when it comes to assignments or transfers of the agreement. This implies that both parties are expected to maintain a level of respect and cooperation, which aligns with the spirit of non-disparagement.

2. **Reasonableness of Consent**: The clause states that consent for assignment should not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This principle of reasonableness can also apply to non-disparagement, suggesting that both parties should act in good faith and avoid actions that could harm the other party's reputation.

3. **Protection Against Competitors**: The provision that withholding consent for assignment to a competitor is deemed reasonable reinforces the idea that parties should protect their interests and reputations. This is relevant to non-disparagement as it highlights the importance of maintaining a positive image and avoiding actions that could be detrimental to the other party.

In summary, while the clause does not directly address non-disparagement, it establishes a framework of mutual respect and cooperation that is essential for upholding a non-disparagement agreement. It underscores the importance of consent and reasonableness in interactions between the parties, which is a key aspect of non-disparagement principles.",3

By including this clause, the parties are essentially agreeing to uphold a standard of conduct that avoids disparagement, particularly concerning their intellectual property.

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - **ROFR Sale Notice**: This is a notice that the Farids Group must provide to the Company when they intend to transfer shares, giving the Company the right to purchase those shares before they are offered to third parties.
   - **ROFO Sale Notice**: Similar to the ROFR, this notice is provided when the Farids Group intends to sell shares, allowing the Company the first opportunity to purchase those shares.

2. **Procedural Requirements**:
   - The clause specifies that the Farids Group can only deliver one ROFR Sale Notice or ROFO Sale Notice within a 30-day period, which establishes a limit on how frequently they can propose share transfers.
   - It details the necessary contents of the ROFR Sale Notice and ROFO Sale Notice, including information about the proposed transferee, the number of shares, the sale price, and the proposed date of transfer.

3. **Transfer Conditions**:
   - The clause outlines the conditions under which the Farids Group can transfer shares if the Company does not respond in a timely manner. If the Company fails to deliver a ROFR Purchase Notice or ROFO Purchase Notice within the specified timeframes, it waives its rights to purchase the shares, allowing the Farids Group to proceed with the transfer to the proposed third-party transferee.

4. **Implications for Shareholders**:
   - This clause is significant for shareholders as it protects their interests by ensuring they have the first opportunity to purchase shares before they are sold to outside parties, particularly competitors. It also establishes a clear process for notifications and responses, which is crucial for maintaining transparency and fairness in share transactions.

In summary, the clause is directly related to the concepts of ROFR and ROFO by defining the procedures, limitations, and rights associated with the transfer of shares, thereby ensuring that the Farids Group and the Company adhere to agreed-upon protocols in share transactions. ROFN is not explicitly mentioned in the clause, but it generally refers to a similar concept of negotiation rights that could be inferred in the context of these transfer rights.",5

Here's how the clause connects to the query:

1. **Definition of ROFR**: The clause defines Calm's right of first refusal (ROFR) in relation to any offers XSPA receives to sell or promote products outside the designated territory. This aligns with the concept of ROFR, which allows a party the opportunity to enter into a business transaction before the offer is made available to others.

2. **ROFR Notice**: The clause specifies that XSPA must provide a ""ROFR Notice"" to Calm whenever it receives an offer or proposes to make an offer related to the products in question. This notice is a critical component of the ROFR process, as it formally informs Calm of the opportunity to exercise its rights.

3. **ROFR Period**: The clause establishes a specific timeframe (the ""ROFR Period"") during which Calm can exercise its right of first refusal after receiving the ROFR Notice. This timeframe is essential for ensuring that Calm has a fair opportunity to consider the offer before XSPA can engage with third parties.

4. **Conditions for Exercising ROFR**: The clause outlines the conditions under which Calm can exercise its ROFR, including the requirement that any agreement XSPA enters into with a third party must be on the same terms as those offered to Calm. If XSPA modifies the terms, it must issue a new ROFR Notice, ensuring that Calm is kept informed of any changes.

5. **Post-Term Rights**: The clause also mentions that Calm retains its ROFR for six months after the expiration or termination of the agreement, which extends the relevance of the ROFR beyond the active term of the contract.

In summary, this clause is a clear articulation of the ROFR mechanism, detailing how and when Calm can exercise its rights in relation to offers made by XSPA, thus directly addressing the query about ROFR/Rofo/Rofn.",5

In relation to the query regarding Rofr (Right of First Refusal), Rofo (Right of First Offer), and Rofn (Right of First Negotiation), this clause is relevant because it highlights the exclusivity of the relationship and communication between PFHOF and the NFL. 

1. **Rofr (Right of First Refusal)**: If there were any opportunities for investment or collaboration that the NFL might consider, PFHOF would likely have the right to refuse or accept those opportunities first, as indicated by the exclusivity of the relationship.

2. **Rofo (Right of First Offer)**: The clause implies that PFHOF would be the first entity to be approached regarding any opportunities or projects involving the NFL, which aligns with the concept of a right of first offer.

3. **Rofn (Right of First Negotiation)**: The provision that allows the Village Media Company to present opportunities for approval by PFHOF suggests that PFHOF has the right to negotiate terms before any other parties are involved, which is consistent with the right of first negotiation.

Overall, the exclusivity and communication protocols established in the clause could impact how rights like Rofr, Rofo, and Rofn are exercised or enforced in relation to any dealings with the NFL and its associated entities.",5

However, it is relevant in the context of contractual relationships and communication protocols, which are often critical in agreements involving rights of first refusal, first offer, or first negotiation.

In the context of Rofr/Rofo/Rofn, these rights typically pertain to the obligations and procedures that parties must follow when negotiating or offering opportunities related to investments or projects. The clause emphasizes that all communications regarding certain activities must go through PFHOF, establishing a clear protocol for how negotiations and offers should be handled. This could imply that any potential investment opportunities or negotiations involving the NFL and the Village Media Company would need to adhere to this communication structure, which could be relevant if any Rofr/Rofo/Rofn rights were to be exercised.

Key points of relevance include:

1. **ROFR Notice**: The clause specifies that XSPA must provide a ""ROFR Notice"" to Calm whenever it offers or receives an offer to enter into an agreement for the sale or marketing of products outside the designated territory. This aligns with the concept of a right of first refusal, where the holder (Calm) is given the first opportunity to accept the terms before the offering party (XSPA) can proceed with a third party.

2. **ROFR Period**: The clause defines a specific time frame (the ""ROFR Period"") during which Calm can exercise its right. This is a critical aspect of ROFR agreements, as it establishes the timeline for the holder to respond to the offer.

3. **Terms of Agreement**: The clause stipulates that if Calm does not exercise its ROFR within the specified period, XSPA is free to enter into an agreement with a third party, but only on the same terms initially offered to Calm. This ensures that Calm is not disadvantaged by any changes in the offer after it has had the opportunity to respond.

4. **Post-Term Rights**: The clause also extends Calm's right of first refusal for six months after the expiration or termination of the agreement, which is an important consideration for ongoing business relationships and potential future opportunities.

Overall, this clause exemplifies the mechanics of a right of first refusal, making it a practical application of the ROFR concept in a contractual setting.",5

Here’s how it aligns with your request:

1. **General Anti-Assignment Provision**: The clause begins with a general prohibition against assigning rights or obligations under the agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. This establishes the baseline for the anti-assignment rule.

2. **Exceptions for Affiliates**: The clause explicitly allows either party to assign the agreement to an affiliate without needing the other party's consent. This directly addresses your query by indicating that assignments to affiliates are treated differently from other types of assignments.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause stipulates that the assigning party must provide notice to the other party when an assignment to an affiliate occurs.

4. **Non-voiding of Assignment**: Importantly, the clause states that failure to provide notice does not render the assignment void. This means that while notice is required, the lack of it does not invalidate the assignment, which is a nuanced approach that balances the need for communication with the flexibility of assignments to affiliates.

5. **Additional Provisions for Third Parties**: The clause also includes provisions for assignments to third parties, which are more stringent and require the assignee to assume obligations and provide documentation.

Here’s how it aligns with your request:

1. **General Anti-Assignment Provision**: The clause begins with a general prohibition against assigning rights or obligations under the agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. This establishes the baseline for the anti-assignment rule.

2. **Exceptions for Affiliates**: The clause explicitly allows either party to assign the agreement to an affiliate without needing the other party's consent. This directly addresses your query by indicating that assignments to affiliates are treated differently from other types of assignments.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause stipulates that the assigning party must provide notice to the other party when an assignment to an affiliate occurs. This aligns with your request for a notice requirement specifically for assignments to affiliates.

4. **Non-voiding of Assignment**: Importantly, the clause states that failure to provide notice does not render the assignment void. This means that while notice is required, the lack of it does not invalidate the assignment, which may be a crucial aspect for parties concerned about the enforceability of such assignments.

5. **Additional Provisions for Third-Party Assignments**: The clause also outlines conditions for assignments to third parties, which are more stringent than those for affiliates. This further emphasizes the distinction between the two types of assignments, reinforcing the idea that assignments to affiliates are subject to a lighter regulatory burden (i.e., just notice).

In summary, this clause effectively captures the essence of your query by allowing assignments to affiliates with a notice requirement, while maintaining a more restrictive approach for other types of assignments.",5
Anti-Assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates,437f5ab14e,"Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 11.1 shall be void. Neither this Agreement nor any interest hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as follows: (a) such Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, provided that the assignee shall expressly agree to be bound by such Party's obligations under this Agreement and that such Party shall remain liable for all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (b) either Party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a Third Party in connection with a permitted assignment or other permitted transfer of the License Agreement. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1.","The provided clause is relevant to your query regarding an anti-assignment clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates. Here's how it aligns with your request:

1. **Assignment Restrictions**: The clause establishes that neither party can assign their rights and obligations under the agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. This is a typical feature of anti-assignment clauses, which aim to maintain control over who can assume the rights and responsibilities under the contract.

2. **Affiliate Assignments**: The clause specifically allows a party to assign its rights and obligations to its affiliates without needing the other party's consent, provided that the affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations of the original party. This directly addresses your query by indicating that assignments to affiliates are permitted without prior consent, which is a common practice in contracts to facilitate internal business operations.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause includes a requirement for each party to ""promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer"" under the specified provisions. This means that while consent is not required for assignments to affiliates, there is still an obligation to inform the other party about such assignments. This aligns with your request for a notice requirement specifically for assignments to affiliates.

4. **Liability Retention**: The clause also states that the original party remains liable for its obligations even after assigning them to an affiliate. This is important as it ensures that the original party does not escape its responsibilities under the agreement, which is a common concern in anti-assignment clauses.

In summary, the clause effectively balances the need for control over assignments with the flexibility to assign to affiliates, while also incorporating a notice requirement, making it relevant to your query about an anti-assignment clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates.",5

2. **Exceptions for Affiliates**: The clause includes a specific exception that allows a party to assign its rights and obligations to its affiliates without needing prior consent, as long as the affiliate agrees to be bound by the obligations of the agreement. This directly addresses your query by indicating that assignments to affiliates are permitted without prior consent, which is a common practice in contracts to allow for flexibility within corporate structures.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause also includes a requirement for each party to promptly notify the other of any assignment or transfer under this section. This means that while consent is not required for assignments to affiliates, there is still a notice obligation, which aligns with your interest in a clause that requires notice specifically for assignments to affiliates.

4. **Liability Retention**: The clause stipulates that the original party remains liable for its obligations even after assigning to an affiliate. This is an important aspect of the assignment process, ensuring that the original party cannot escape its responsibilities.

Anti-Assignment clause that requires notice only for assignment to affiliates,922bd67793,"Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be void. This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party unless the assignee expressly assumes in writing the obligations of the assignor hereunder. Network Affiliate may not assign or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any of its rights under this Agreement or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any third party without NCM's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.","The clause you provided contains an anti-assignment provision that outlines the conditions under which one party (in this case, ""Network Affiliate"") may assign or transfer its rights and obligations under the agreement. Here’s how it relates to your query about requiring notice only for assignments to affiliates:

1. **General Anti-Assignment Language**: The clause states that any attempted assignment in violation of the section shall be void, indicating a strong restriction on assignments. This is a common feature in contracts to protect the interests of the parties involved.

2. **Consent Requirement**: The clause specifies that Network Affiliate cannot assign or transfer its rights or delegate its duties to any third party without obtaining prior written consent from NCM. This requirement for consent is a typical element of anti-assignment clauses, ensuring that the original party retains control over who may assume the contractual obligations.

3. **Absence of Affiliate Exception**: The clause does not explicitly mention any exceptions for assignments to affiliates. In your query, you are looking for a clause that requires notice only for assignments to affiliates, which would imply that assignments to affiliates could occur without the need for prior consent, provided that notice is given. The current clause, however, does not allow for any assignments without prior consent, regardless of whether the assignee is an affiliate or not.

4. **Implication of Unreasonableness**: The clause states that consent from NCM shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. This could imply that if the assignment is to an affiliate, NCM may be more inclined to grant consent, but the clause does not explicitly state that assignments to affiliates are treated differently from other assignments.

In summary, while the clause establishes a general anti-assignment rule requiring consent for any assignment, it does not specifically address the scenario of assignments to affiliates, which is the focus of your query. If you want to include a provision that allows assignments to affiliates with only notice required, you would need to modify the clause to reflect that exception explicitly.",3

3. **Performance Conditions**: The clause also includes conditions that must be met by HSNS, such as training requirements for its staff, which are tied to the fulfillment of the minimum commitment. This indicates that the commitment is not just a flat payment but is contingent upon certain actions being taken.

4. **Incremental Increases**: The clause outlines that the minimum commitment will increase in Years 2 and 3, which reflects a structured approach to minimum commitments over time, rather than a static obligation.

It states that a failure by the Investor to maintain a minimum committed capital amount of $5,000,000, minus any Required Capital Contributions made, will constitute a default under the agreement. 

This clause is relevant to the query about ""Minimum Commitment"" because it establishes a clear financial threshold that the Investor must meet to avoid defaulting on their obligations. The term ""Minimum Commitment"" in this context refers to the minimum amount of capital that the Investor is required to have committed at any given time during the term of the agreement. 

The clause also specifies the process for verifying this commitment, requiring the Investor to provide evidence (such as a sworn affidavit) to the Agent to confirm that they meet the minimum capital requirement. This ensures that the parties involved have a clear understanding of the financial commitments required and the consequences of failing to meet those commitments, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the agreement and protecting the interests of all parties involved. 

In summary, the clause directly addresses the concept of ""Minimum Commitment"" by defining the required capital amount and the implications of not meeting that requirement, thereby establishing a critical condition for the Investor's ongoing obligations under the agreement.",5
IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,838dcfbc11,"Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may transfer or assign its rights under this IP Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, on condition that it provides the <omitted> other Party with notice of the transfer or assignment.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding IP (Intellectual Property) ownership assignment or transfer because it outlines the conditions under which a party may transfer or assign its rights under the IP Agreement. Specifically, it states that a party is permitted to transfer or assign its rights in the context of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all of its assets.

Here are the key points of relevance:

1. **Transfer Conditions**: The clause specifies that the transfer or assignment of rights is permissible only in connection with major corporate events. This is important for ensuring that the rights to the intellectual property are not transferred arbitrarily or without proper context.

2. **Notice Requirement**: The clause includes a requirement for the transferring party to provide notice to the other party involved in the agreement. This ensures transparency and allows the other party to be aware of changes in ownership or rights related to the intellectual property, which can be crucial for maintaining the integrity of the agreement and for any future dealings.

3. **Protection of Rights**: By allowing transfers only under specific conditions and requiring notice, the clause helps protect the rights of both parties involved in the IP Agreement.

IP Ownership Assignment or Transfer,adb92d0221,"If and to the extent that, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any of the Assigned IP cannot be assigned as provided in Section 2.1(b)(i), (A) the Seller irrevocably agrees to (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to) assign and transfer, and the Seller hereby assigns and transfers (and shall cause the other Seller Parties to assign and transfer) to the Purchaser Assignees all rights (including all economic and commercialization rights) that can be assigned pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(i) to the fullest extent permissible, and (B) the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser Assignees, and hereby agrees to cause the other Seller Parties to grant to the Purchaser Assignees, an unlimited, exclusive, irrevocable, assignable, transferable, sublicenseable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, fully-paid up license to use, exploit, and commercialize in any manner now known or in the future discovered and for whatever purpose, any and all rights to Assigned IP that cannot be assigned as contemplated by Section 2.1(b)(i).","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query regarding IP (Intellectual Property) ownership assignment or transfer. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Assignment of Rights**: The clause outlines the process by which the Seller agrees to assign and transfer ownership of certain intellectual property (referred to as ""Assigned IP"") to the Purchaser Assignees. This is a critical aspect of IP ownership transfer, as it specifies the Seller's obligations to ensure that the rights to the IP are conveyed to the Purchaser.

2. **Legal Limitations**: The clause acknowledges that there may be legal limitations in certain jurisdictions that could prevent the full assignment of ownership, title, or rights to the Assigned IP. This is important because it recognizes that not all rights may be transferable due to local laws, which is a common issue in IP transactions.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**: In the event that full ownership cannot be assigned, the clause provides a fallback mechanism. It states that the Seller will grant the Purchaser Assignees a comprehensive license to use, exploit, and commercialize the Assigned IP that cannot be assigned. This ensures that the Purchaser still has the ability to utilize the IP even if full ownership cannot be transferred, thereby protecting their interests.

4. **Scope of License**: The license granted is described as ""unlimited, exclusive, irrevocable, assignable, transferable, sublicenseable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, fully-paid up."" This extensive scope ensures that the Purchaser Assignees have significant rights to the Assigned IP, allowing them to fully exploit the IP without ongoing financial obligations to the Seller.

5. **Compliance with Section 2.1(b)(i)**: The clause references Section 2.1(b)(i), indicating that the assignment and licensing are to be conducted in accordance with the terms outlined in that section. This ties the clause back to the overall agreement and ensures that the parties are aligned on the specific terms of the IP transfer.

In summary, this clause is crucial for establishing how IP ownership will be transferred, addressing potential legal limitations, and ensuring that the Purchaser retains the ability to use the IP effectively, even if full ownership cannot be assigned. It provides clarity and protection for both parties involved in the transaction.",5

1. **Binding Nature**: The clause states that the IP Agreement will be binding upon the parties and their successors and permitted assigns. This means that any rights or obligations under the agreement can be inherited by future parties, which is important for IP ownership as it often involves long-term rights.

2. **Restrictions on Assignment**: The clause explicitly states that the agreement is not assignable or delegable by any party without the prior written consent of the other party. This is crucial in IP agreements because it ensures that the ownership and control of the intellectual property cannot be transferred without mutual agreement, protecting the interests of both parties.

3. **Consequences of Unauthorized Transfer**: The clause further specifies that any attempted transfer that contravenes this section will be null and void. This reinforces the importance of adhering to the assignment restrictions, as any unauthorized transfer would not be legally recognized, thereby maintaining the integrity of the IP ownership.

1. **Conditions on Assignment or Transfer**: The clause specifies that if a Seller Party assigns or transfers any Licensed IP, it must condition that assignment or transfer on the assignee or transferee's acknowledgment and agreement that the Licensed IP remains bound by the existing license grants. This ensures that the rights and obligations associated with the Licensed IP are preserved even after the transfer, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the licensing agreements.

2. **Reciprocal Obligations for Purchaser**: Similarly, if the Purchaser or a Purchaser Assignee assigns or transfers any Intellectual Property licensed to the Seller Parties, they must also condition that transfer on the acknowledgment that the Intellectual Property is bound by the license grants. This reciprocal requirement reinforces the importance of maintaining the terms of the original licensing agreements during any transfer of IP rights.

3. **Restrictions on Assignment**: The clause outlines that neither party can assign the IP Agreement or any of its rights and obligations without the prior written consent of the other party. This restriction is significant as it prevents unauthorized transfers that could disrupt the contractual relationship and the intended use of the IP.

4. **Permitted Assignments**: The clause also provides exceptions to the general rule against assignment, allowing for certain types of assignments (e.g., to affiliates, lenders, or in the event of a merger) without prior consent, provided that the other party is notified. This flexibility is important for business operations, especially in scenarios involving corporate restructuring or financing.

5. **Legal Framework**: The clause implicitly acknowledges the legal framework surrounding IP ownership and licensing, emphasizing the need for clear agreements and conditions to protect the interests of both parties involved in the transaction.

2. **Full Title Guarantee**: The phrase ""with full title guarantee"" indicates that the Executive is assuring the Company that they have the right to assign the IP and that the Company will receive clear and unencumbered ownership. This is important in legal terms as it protects the Company from any future claims or disputes regarding the ownership of the IP.

3. **Present Assignment of Future Rights**: The clause mentions a ""present assignment of all future rights,"" which means that any future developments or enhancements related to the Company IP will also automatically belong to the Company.

License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,41ab1a244e,"Licensee may extend the rights granted herein to register, import, export, store, handle, commercialize, promote, distribute and sell to its Affiliates and to its Distributors, provided that Licensee shall first provide to Licensor a written assurance from each of such Affiliate or Distributor to agree to be bound by, and to strictly comply with, all applicable terms, conditions, and obligations in this Agreement towards Licensor.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query regarding a license clause covering affiliates of the licensor and/or licensee. Here's how it connects:

1. **Extension of Rights**: The clause explicitly states that the Licensee has the right to extend the granted rights (such as registration, import, export, storage, handling, commercialization, promotion, distribution, and sale) to its Affiliates and Distributors. This is crucial because it clarifies that the Licensee can involve its related entities in the licensed activities, which is a common practice in licensing agreements.

2. **Written Assurance Requirement**: The clause includes a stipulation that the Licensee must provide a written assurance from each Affiliate or Distributor. This assurance is that they will agree to be bound by the terms, conditions, and obligations of the original licensing agreement. This requirement ensures that the Licensor's interests are protected, as it holds the Licensee accountable for the actions of its Affiliates and Distributors.

3. **Compliance with Agreement**: By mandating that Affiliates and Distributors comply with the terms of the Agreement, the clause ensures that the Licensor maintains control over how the licensed rights are utilized, even when they are extended to third parties. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the licensing arrangement and ensuring that all parties adhere to the same standards and obligations.

Overall, this clause effectively addresses the relationship between the Licensee and its Affiliates/Distributors, ensuring that the Licensor's rights and interests are safeguarded while allowing for the flexibility of extending the license to related entities.",5
License clause covering affiliates of licensor and/or licensee,6c03a4a6cd,"Licensee shall not be entitled to assign the License or any of its rights under this Agreement or to grant any sub-licenses.

1. **Assignment Rights**: The clause states that the licensee cannot assign the license or grant sub-licenses without the prior written consent of the licensor. This establishes a clear boundary for the licensee regarding the transfer of rights, ensuring that the licensor maintains control over who can use the licensed product.

2. **Licensor's Flexibility**: In contrast, the clause allows the licensor to assign the agreement and its rights and obligations to an affiliate without needing the licensee's consent. This provision is significant because it enables the licensor to maintain operational flexibility, particularly in scenarios such as mergers, consolidations, or asset transfers. 

3. **Protection of Interests**: By allowing the licensor to assign rights to affiliates, the clause ensures that the licensor can adapt to changes in its corporate structure or business strategy while still protecting the licensee's interests by requiring consent for any assignment by the licensee.

Overall, this clause effectively balances the rights of both parties while specifically addressing the role of affiliates in the context of the license agreement, which is central to the query about covering affiliates of the licensor and/or licensee.",5

Liquidated Damages,78643f2042,"The amounts contemplated under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is not a penalty and is intended by the parties only as a compensatory remedy for past breaches and not as a preventative remedy to deter future breaches. Nevertheless, the parties agree that the lump-sum payment provided under Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above is reasonable in light of the damages for premature termination that may reasonably be expected to occur in such event. If this Agreement is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum payment in an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your Royalty fees and Advertising Contributions due for the last 60 months before our delivery of notice of default (or, if lesser, the months you had been operating before our delivery of notice of default), (b) multiplied by the lesser of 60 or the number of months remaining in the term of this Agreement. The payments called for in Section 16.4 [Liquidated Damages] above constitute liquidated damages for causing the premature termination of this Agreement and not a penalty.","The clause you provided is directly relevant to the query about liquidated damages as it outlines the specific terms and conditions under which liquidated damages are assessed in the context of a contractual agreement. Here’s how it relates:

1. **Definition of Liquidated Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the amounts specified under Section 16.4 are not considered a penalty but rather a compensatory remedy for past breaches. This distinction is crucial because liquidated damages are intended to provide a pre-agreed amount that reflects the anticipated damages resulting from a breach, rather than serving as a punitive measure.

2. **Calculation Method**: The clause details the method for calculating the liquidated damages, which involves taking the average of royalty fees and advertising contributions over the last 60 months and multiplying that by the lesser of 60 months or the remaining term of the agreement. This calculation provides a clear and objective basis for determining the amount owed in the event of a default, which is a key characteristic of liquidated damages.

3. **Reasonableness of the Amount**: The clause asserts that the lump-sum payment is reasonable in light of the damages that may be expected from premature termination. This is important because, for liquidated damages to be enforceable, they must be reasonable and not excessively disproportionate to the actual harm caused by the breach.

4. **Context of Default**: The clause specifies that the obligation to pay liquidated damages arises if the agreement is terminated due to the default of one party. This establishes a clear trigger for the application of liquidated damages, aligning with the general principles of contract law regarding breaches and remedies.

5. **Compensatory Nature**: By emphasizing that the liquidated damages are intended as compensation for past breaches rather than a deterrent for future breaches, the clause reinforces the purpose of liquidated damages in contracts, which is to provide a fair estimate of damages rather than to punish the breaching party.

This clause specifies that upon termination of the agreement for cause, the party terminating the agreement is entitled to a specific calculation of damages.

It states that the amount owed will be based on the average monthly fees (Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee) paid during the twelve months preceding termination, multiplied by either twenty-four months or the number of months remaining in the agreement, whichever is lower. This method provides a clear formula for determining the damages, which is a key characteristic of liquidated damages provisions.

3. **Reasonableness and Good Faith**: The clause emphasizes that the parties consider the liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable and good faith pre-estimate of potential damages. This is important because, for a liquidated damages clause to be enforceable, it must be shown that the amount is not punitive but rather a fair estimate of the anticipated loss due to the breach.

4. **Limitation of Remedies**: The clause also indicates that the liquidated damages provision does not provide an adequate remedy at law for other defaults under the agreement, which reinforces the idea that the liquidated damages are specifically tailored to address the consequences of termination and are not a blanket remedy for all breaches.

1. **Definition of Liquidated Damages**: The clause specifies that upon termination of the agreement, the party (referred to as ""you"") agrees to pay a predetermined amount as liquidated damages. This amount is calculated based on the average monthly fees paid during the previous twelve months, multiplied by either twenty-four months or the number of months remaining in the agreement, whichever is lower.

2. **Reasonableness and Good Faith**: The clause states that the parties consider the liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable and good faith pre-estimate of damages.

3. **Limitation of Remedies**: The clause also indicates that the liquidated damages provision does not provide an adequate remedy at law for any default under the agreement, except for the specified Royalty Fee sections.

1. **Definition of Liquidated Damages**: Liquidated damages are pre-determined amounts that one party agrees to pay to the other in the event of a breach of contract or failure to perform certain obligations. They are intended to provide a measure of compensation that is agreed upon in advance, rather than leaving it to the courts to determine damages after a breach occurs.

2. **Application in the Clause**:
   - The clause specifies that if Party B terminates the agreement without the consent of Party A, Party B is required to pay one month's freight as liquidated damages. This establishes a clear financial consequence for terminating the agreement without proper authorization.
   - Additionally, the clause outlines a tiered structure for liquidated damages related to delays in parcel transfer due to Party B's vehicle issues. The escalating amounts (RMB500, RMB1,000, and RMB2,000) for each day of delay provide a clear framework for calculating damages based on the duration of the delay. This structure serves to incentivize timely performance and provides Party A with a predictable means of compensation for the inconvenience caused by Party B's delays.

3. **Relevance to the Query**: The clause exemplifies how liquidated damages can be structured within a contract to address specific scenarios, such as unauthorized termination and delays in performance. It highlights the importance of having clear terms in a contract that define the consequences of certain actions (or inactions) by the parties involved. This aligns with the broader legal principle of liquidated damages, which aims to provide certainty and avoid disputes over damages after a breach occurs.

Service Provider shall provide and maintain commercial general liability insurance with combined single policy limits not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for bodily injury or property damage for each occurrence and in the aggregate, including broad form contractual liability insurance, broad form property damage, personal injury, products and completed operations insurance.
(b) Automobile Liability. Service Provider shall provide and maintain business auto liability insurance covering owned, non-owned and hired automobiles in the amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined<omitted>single policy limit for bodily injury and property damage for each accident.","The clause provided outlines the insurance requirements that a Service Provider must adhere to in relation to the services they provide. This is highly relevant to the query about insurance for several reasons:

1. **Types of Insurance Required**: The clause specifies various types of insurance that the Service Provider must maintain, including excess liability insurance, commercial general liability insurance, business automobile liability insurance, and worker's compensation insurance. This directly addresses the need for comprehensive coverage to protect against potential liabilities arising from the services performed.

2. **Coverage Amounts**: It details the specific coverage limits required for each type of insurance, such as $5,000,000 for excess liability and $2,000,000 for commercial general liability. This is crucial for understanding the financial protection that the Service Provider must have in place.

3. **Additional Insureds**: The clause mandates that certain parties (Owner, User, and potentially others) be included as additional insureds on the policies. This is important for ensuring that these parties are protected under the Service Provider's insurance in the event of a claim.

4. **Primary Insurance**: It specifies that the insurance policies must be primary and not excess to any other insurance maintained by the Owner or related parties. This ensures that the Service Provider's insurance will respond first in the event of a claim, which is a critical aspect of risk management.

5. **Compliance with Laws**: The requirement for worker's compensation insurance to comply with applicable laws highlights the legal obligations that the Service Provider must meet, which is a fundamental aspect of insurance in business operations.

6. **Certificate of Insurance**: The clause requires the Service Provider to provide a certificate of insurance within a specified timeframe, ensuring that the Owner has proof of the required coverage. This is a common practice in contractual agreements to verify compliance with insurance obligations.

Overall, this clause is a comprehensive outline of the insurance obligations of the Service Provider, ensuring that adequate protections are in place for both the Service Provider and the Owner against potential liabilities arising from the services provided. It reflects the importance of insurance in managing risk in contractual relationships.",5
Covenant Not To Sue,f3ceb882eb,"There are no representations, warranties or covenants other than those set forth herein.","The clause ""There are no representations, warranties or covenants other than those set forth herein"" is relevant to the query about a ""Covenant Not To Sue"" because it establishes the scope and limitations of the agreements made between the parties involved in the contract. 

In the context of a Covenant Not To Sue, this clause implies that the parties are agreeing that the only obligations, promises, or assurances they have are those explicitly stated in the contract. This means that neither party can rely on any external representations, warranties, or covenants that are not included in the contract. 

This is significant because if a party were to attempt to bring a lawsuit based on a claim that is not covered by the representations or warranties in the contract, the other party could invoke this clause to argue that such claims are invalid. Essentially, it reinforces the idea that the parties are bound only by what is written in the contract, thereby limiting potential legal disputes and claims that could arise from misunderstandings or assumptions about additional obligations. 

In summary, this clause supports the enforceability of a Covenant Not To Sue by clarifying that the parties have no other legal recourse based on representations or warranties outside of what is explicitly stated in the agreement.",5
Covenant Not To Sue,5963bd4697,"Each party covenants that it shall not, under any circumstances, sue the other party (or its officers, directors, successors and assigns) or any of that parties' licensees, customers, or distributors (""Protected Entities"") for patent infringment under any future patents or future patent rights relating to said Developments, that either party owns or controls, so long as that Protected Entity has a license from Commerce One or Corio to the Software, or to a product that is a modification of, derivative work based on, or replacement for the Software.","The clause you provided is a ""Covenant Not To Sue"" specifically related to patent infringement. This type of covenant is relevant to the query because it outlines the agreement between the parties regarding their rights and obligations concerning potential patent disputes.

Here's how the clause is relevant:

1. **Prohibition of Legal Action**: The clause explicitly states that each party agrees not to sue the other party or its associated entities (referred to as ""Protected Entities"") for patent infringement. This aligns with the concept of a covenant not to sue, which is designed to prevent litigation between the parties over specified issues—in this case, patent rights.

2. **Scope of Protection**: The clause specifies that the covenant applies to future patents or patent rights related to certain developments owned or controlled by either party. This indicates that the parties are preemptively addressing potential future disputes, which is a common purpose of a covenant not to sue.

3. **Conditions for the Covenant**: The clause includes a condition that the covenant is valid as long as the Protected Entities have a license from either Commerce One or Corio to use the Software or related products. This condition ensures that the covenant is tied to the licensing agreements, which is important for maintaining the legal framework within which the parties operate.

4. **Legal and Business Implications**: By including this covenant, the parties are likely aiming to foster a collaborative relationship and reduce the risk of litigation, which can be costly and time-consuming. This is particularly relevant in industries where intellectual property rights are critical, such as technology and software.

In summary, the clause serves as a clear example of a covenant not to sue, addressing potential patent infringement issues while establishing a framework for cooperation between the parties involved. It is relevant to the query as it encapsulates the essence of what a covenant not to sue entails in a legal context.",5
Covenant Not To Sue,58ba4b99f7,"In the event that Party B breaches this covenant, Party A has the right to terminate this Agreement at any time and require Party B to pay 30% of Party A's share of revenues as liquidated damages.","The clause you provided relates to a covenant not to sue in that it establishes a specific consequence for a breach of the covenant by Party B. In the context of a covenant not to sue, the parties typically agree not to initiate legal action against each other regarding certain matters. However, if one party breaches this agreement, the other party must have a remedy or consequence outlined in the contract.

In this case, the clause specifies that if Party B breaches the covenant, Party A has the right to terminate the Agreement and requires Party B to pay a specified amount (30% of Party A's share of revenues) as liquidated damages. This serves as a deterrent against breaching the covenant and provides Party A with a clear remedy in the event of such a breach.

The relevance to the query about a covenant not to sue lies in the enforcement of the covenant and the consequences of its breach. The clause ensures that there are defined repercussions for failing to adhere to the covenant, which aligns with the principles of specific performance and remedies discussed in the external information provided. Specifically, it highlights the importance of having enforceable terms in a covenant not to sue, as well as the potential for liquidated damages as a remedy for breach.",5
Covenant Not To Sue,f7185926a7,"7) All covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the parties contained in this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties; but nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied is intended to confer on any party the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder.","The clause you provided states that all covenants, promises, and agreements made by the parties in the agreement are binding and will benefit their successors and assigns. However, it also clarifies that no party has the right to assign its rights or obligations under the agreement without the consent of the other parties.

In the context of a ""Covenant Not To Sue,"" this clause is relevant because it establishes the binding nature of the agreements made by the parties, including any covenants not to sue. A covenant not to sue is a promise by one party not to initiate legal action against another party regarding certain matters covered by the agreement. 

The binding nature of the covenants ensures that if one party agrees not to sue, that promise is enforceable against them and will also benefit their successors or assigns. This means that if the original parties to the agreement were to transfer their rights or obligations to another entity, that entity would also be bound by the covenant not to sue, provided that the agreement allows for such a transfer (which, according to this clause, it does not unless consent is given).

Thus, this clause reinforces the enforceability of the covenant not to sue by ensuring that it is a binding commitment that extends to successors and assigns, while also highlighting the limitation on the assignment of rights and obligations, which could impact the ability of parties to enforce or rely on the covenant in the future.",5
Covenant Not To Sue,fb064df507,"There are no covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions or understandings, either oral or written, between the Parties other than as are set forth herein and therein. No subsequent alteration, amendment, change or addition to this Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties unless reduced to writing and signed by an authorized officer of each Party.","The clause provided is relevant to the query about a ""Covenant Not To Sue"" because it establishes the framework for the enforceability and validity of agreements between the parties involved. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Exclusivity of Agreements**: The clause states that there are no other covenants, promises, or agreements between the parties except those explicitly outlined in the agreement. This is significant in the context of a ""Covenant Not To Sue"" because it implies that if such a covenant is not included in the written agreement, it does not exist. This reinforces the importance of having all agreements documented to avoid misunderstandings or disputes.

2. **Modification Requirements**: The clause also specifies that any alterations or amendments to the agreement must be in writing and signed by authorized officers of each party. This means that if the parties wish to include a ""Covenant Not To Sue"" after the initial agreement is made, they must formally document this change. This requirement helps ensure that all parties are aware of and agree to any limitations on their rights to sue, which is the essence of a ""Covenant Not To Sue.""

3. **Legal Certainty**: By emphasizing that no oral or informal agreements are recognized, the clause provides legal certainty. This is particularly important in the context of a ""Covenant Not To Sue,"" as it protects the parties from claims that might arise from informal discussions or understandings that are not captured in the written agreement.

In summary, this clause underlines the necessity for clarity and formality in contractual agreements, particularly regarding any covenants, including a ""Covenant Not To Sue."" It ensures that all parties are bound only by what is explicitly stated in the written agreement, thereby preventing any potential legal disputes over unrecorded agreements.",5
Third Party Beneficiary,5be233053b,"There are no Third Party beneficiaries under this Agreement, except to the extent a Third Party is indemnified pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance); provided that, in no event will any Third Party entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance) be allowed to enforce the terms thereof against a Party.","The clause you provided explicitly addresses the concept of third-party beneficiaries in the context of the agreement. It states that there are no third-party beneficiaries under the agreement, which means that only the parties directly involved in the contract have rights and obligations under it. 

However, it makes an exception for third parties who may be indemnified under Article 12 (Indemnification; Insurance). This means that while third parties cannot generally enforce the terms of the agreement, they may still receive certain protections or benefits related to indemnification. Importantly, the clause clarifies that even those third parties who are entitled to indemnification cannot enforce the terms of the indemnification against any party to the agreement.

This is relevant to the query about third-party beneficiaries because it outlines the limitations on the rights of third parties in relation to the agreement. It emphasizes that, aside from the specific indemnification provisions, third parties do not have the ability to claim rights or enforce terms of the contract, which is a key aspect of understanding the legal standing of third parties in contractual relationships.",5

A third-party beneficiary is a person or entity that, while not a party to a contract, may still have rights or benefits under that contract due to its terms. 

In the clause, it explicitly states that ""no person or entity not a Party to this Agreement... shall be a third-party beneficiary of any provision of this Agreement."" This means that only the parties to the contract (the signatories of the agreement) have rights and benefits under the contract, and no other individuals or entities, including employees or affiliates of the parties, can claim any rights or benefits from the agreement. 

This clause serves to limit the scope of who can enforce the contract or claim benefits from it, thereby protecting the parties from potential claims by third parties who might otherwise argue that they have rights under the agreement. It reinforces the principle that the contract is intended solely for the benefit of the parties involved and not for any external parties. 

In summary, this clause is a clear statement that aims to prevent any third-party claims, aligning with the legal understanding of third-party beneficiaries and ensuring that the rights and obligations under the contract are confined to the parties who have entered into it.",5
Third Party Beneficiary,c0b9f75e32,"Ehave shall be a third party beneficiary hereunder, but shall not have any obligations to the End User thereunder.","The clause you provided states that ""Ehave shall be a third party beneficiary hereunder, but shall not have any obligations to the End User thereunder."" This is directly relevant to the concept of a third-party beneficiary in contract law.

### Explanation:

1. **Third Party Beneficiary**: A third-party beneficiary is a person or entity that is not a party to a contract but stands to benefit from its execution. In this case, ""Ehave"" is identified as a third-party beneficiary, meaning that the contract is intended to benefit Ehave in some way.

2. **No Obligations**: The clause specifies that while Ehave is a beneficiary, it does not have any obligations to the ""End User."" This is significant because it clarifies the nature of Ehave's involvement in the contract. Ehave can benefit from the contract's provisions without being held responsible for fulfilling any duties or obligations towards the End User.

3. **Legal Implications**: This clause helps delineate the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved. It protects Ehave by ensuring that it cannot be held liable for any obligations that may arise from the contract, while still allowing it to enjoy the benefits that the contract provides.

In summary, this clause is a clear articulation of Ehave's status as a third-party beneficiary, which is a key aspect of understanding the rights and responsibilities in contractual relationships. It highlights the distinction between benefiting from a contract and being bound by its obligations, which is central to the concept of third-party beneficiaries.",5
Third Party Beneficiary,da102888a8,Lessor and Lessee expressly agree that bw-3 is a third party beneficiary of this Addendum.<omitted>Other System franchisees shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of such.,"The clause you provided explicitly identifies ""bw-3"" and ""Other System franchisees"" as third party beneficiaries of the Addendum. This is directly relevant to the concept of a third party beneficiary in contract law, which refers to a person or entity that is not a party to a contract but stands to benefit from its execution.

In this context, the clause indicates that the parties to the Addendum (the Lessor and Lessee) have agreed that certain third parties (bw-3 and Other System franchisees) will have rights or benefits under the contract. This means that these third parties may have the ability to enforce certain provisions of the Addendum or claim benefits that arise from it, even though they are not directly involved in the agreement between the Lessor and Lessee.

This clause is significant because it clarifies the intention of the contracting parties to extend certain rights to third parties, which can affect how the contract is interpreted and enforced. It also highlights the importance of clearly defining who the third party beneficiaries are, as this can impact their legal standing and ability to seek remedies if the terms of the contract are not fulfilled.",5
Third Party Beneficiary,3a665eb6e6,"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, both the Owner and Servicer agree that the Agent shall be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and has the authority to enforce the provisions hereof.","The clause you provided explicitly designates the Agent as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement between the Owner and Servicer. This is relevant to the concept of a third-party beneficiary in contract law, which refers to a person or entity that, while not a party to the contract, is intended to benefit from its provisions and has the right to enforce those provisions.

In this case, the clause states that the Agent has the authority to enforce the terms of the Agreement, which means that the Agent can take legal action to ensure compliance with the Agreement's provisions, even though the Agent is not one of the primary parties (Owner or Servicer) involved in the contract. This aligns with the general principles of third-party beneficiary rights, where such beneficiaries can seek remedies if the contract is breached in a way that affects their interests.

The relevance of this clause to the query about third-party beneficiaries is that it illustrates how a contract can explicitly confer rights to a third party, allowing them to enforce the contract and seek remedies, such as injunctions or specific performance, as mentioned in the external information. This is particularly important in ensuring that the interests of the Agent are protected and that they can act if the Owner or Servicer fails to fulfill their obligations under the Agreement.",5

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause specifies a ""Liability Cap,"" which is the maximum amount one party can be held liable to the other party and its affiliates in relation to the agreement. This establishes a clear limit on potential financial exposure, which is a common practice in contracts to manage risk.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause also outlines specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply:
   - **Material Breach of Confidentiality**: If there is a significant breach of confidentiality as defined in Section 5, the cap does not limit liability. This emphasizes the importance of confidentiality in the agreement.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: The cap does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1, meaning that if one party is required to indemnify the other, the cap does not limit the amount they may have to pay.
   - **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: The Liability Cap does not apply in cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, which are serious breaches of duty that warrant full liability.

3. **Broad Definition of Liability**: The clause defines ""liability"" broadly to include various claims and damages, whether arising from contract, tort, equity, or statute. This comprehensive definition ensures that all potential liabilities are considered under the cap, except for the specified exceptions.

This establishes a clear limit on potential financial exposure, which is a key aspect of a cap on liability.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause includes specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply. These exceptions are critical because they outline circumstances under which a party can be held liable beyond the established cap. For instance:
   - Breaches of confidentiality (Section 5) are excluded from the cap, meaning that if one party discloses confidential information, they could be liable for damages without the limitation.
   - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1) are also excluded, indicating that if one party is required to indemnify the other, the cap does not limit that obligation.
   - Intentional misconduct and gross negligence are also excluded, meaning that if a party acts with intent to harm or shows a severe lack of care, they can be held liable beyond the cap.

3. **Broad Definition of Liability**: The clause defines ""liability"" broadly, encompassing various claims and damages, whether arising from contract, tort, or other legal theories. This comprehensive definition ensures that the cap applies to a wide range of potential liabilities, but also clarifies the scope of what is covered.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it explicitly sets a limit on liability (the Liability Cap) while also detailing exceptions that allow for greater liability in specific situations.

This amount is defined as the total purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for products over the twelve months preceding the claim notification.

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the aggregate liability of Fiserv and the Merchant to each other for losses arising from any cause in connection with the agreement is limited to AUD 50,000.

This means that even if one party suffers significant losses as a result of the other party's actions or failures, they cannot claim these types of damages. This is a common way to limit liability and protect parties from extensive financial exposure.

3. **Comparison to Purchase Price**: While the clause does not explicitly state that the liability cap is based on the purchase price, it does set a fixed monetary limit (AUD 50,000). In many contracts, liability caps can be tied to the purchase price or the value of the contract. If the purchase price were significantly higher than the liability cap, it could raise questions about the adequacy of the cap in relation to the overall value of the transaction.

In summary, this clause is relevant because it defines the limits of liability between the parties, which is a critical aspect of risk management in contractual agreements. Understanding how this cap relates to the overall transaction value (such as the purchase price) is essential for assessing the adequacy of the liability protection provided in the agreement.",4
liability cap is based on purchase price,178516ef09,"Dealer's aggregate liability to Vendor for any and all claims of any kind relating to the Products, will not exceed the unpaid price of those Products which directly give rise to, or are related to, the claims whether based on contract, negligence, strict liability, tort or otherwise​​.","The clause you provided establishes a liability cap for the Dealer's aggregate liability to the Vendor, specifically stating that this liability will not exceed the unpaid price of the Products that are directly related to the claims. This is directly relevant to your query about a liability cap being based on the purchase price.

Here's how the clause aligns with the concept of a liability cap based on purchase price:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly limits the Dealer's liability to the amount that is unpaid for the Products in question. This means that regardless of the nature of the claims (contractual, negligence, etc.), the maximum amount the Dealer could be held liable for is capped at the purchase price of the Products that are the subject of the claims.

2. **Scope of Claims**: The clause covers ""any and all claims of any kind"" related to the Products, which indicates a broad application of the liability cap. This reinforces the idea that the liability is not only limited to specific types of claims but encompasses all potential claims arising from the transaction.

3. **Direct Relation to Purchase Price**: By tying the liability cap directly to the unpaid price of the Products, the clause ensures that the financial exposure of the Dealer is predictable and limited, which is a common practice in commercial agreements to manage risk.

In summary, this clause effectively implements a liability cap based on the purchase price of the Products, aligning with your query about how such a cap is structured in legal agreements.",5

This amount is typically negotiated and can often be tied to the purchase price of the transaction, although the exact relationship to the purchase price is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

2. **Exclusions from Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific circumstances under which the Liability Cap does not apply, such as breaches of confidentiality and indemnification obligations. This means that even if the Liability Cap is based on the purchase price, certain serious breaches or misconduct can lead to liabilities that exceed this cap.

3. **Broad Definition of Liability**: The clause defines ""liability"" broadly, encompassing various claims and damages arising from the agreement. This broad definition is important because it clarifies what types of claims may be subject to the Liability Cap, which could include claims related to the purchase price.

4. **Implications for Parties**: By establishing a Liability Cap, the clause limits the financial exposure of the parties involved in the agreement. If the cap is indeed based on the purchase price, it serves to protect the parties from excessive liability that could arise from various claims related to the agreement.

1. **Scope of Liability**: The clause explicitly limits the liability of the parties to the agreement by excluding certain types of damages, such as consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or enhanced damages. This limitation is significant because it establishes a clear boundary on the financial exposure of each party in the event of a breach of the agreement.

2. **Insurance Coverage Considerations**: In many contractual agreements, parties may seek to mitigate their risk through insurance. The limitation of liability clause can influence the type and amount of insurance coverage that parties choose to obtain. For instance, if a party knows that its liability is capped under the agreement, it may opt for a lower level of insurance coverage, as the potential financial exposure is reduced. Conversely, if the limitation of liability is more lenient (i.e., allowing for more types of damages), parties may seek higher coverage to protect against greater risks.

3. **Precedents and Case Law**: The clause may also reflect or be influenced by legal precedents regarding the enforceability of limitation of liability clauses in the context of insurance. Courts often examine whether such clauses are reasonable and whether they align with public policy, especially in cases involving negligence or gross misconduct. If a party's liability is limited, it may affect the insurance claims process, as insurers may be less willing to cover claims that arise from excluded damages.

4. **Negotiation and Risk Allocation**: The presence of a limitation of liability clause can be a point of negotiation between parties. If one party has significant insurance coverage, it may be more amenable to accepting a broader limitation of liability, knowing that its insurance will cover potential claims. This dynamic can influence how parties structure their agreements and the extent to which they rely on insurance to manage risk.

5. **Legal Remedies**: The references in the external information to irreparable damage and the right to seek equitable relief (such as injunctions) suggest that while the limitation of liability clause caps certain types of damages, it does not eliminate the possibility of seeking other forms of legal remedy. This interplay between limitation of liability and available remedies can further influence how parties approach insurance coverage.

In summary, the ""Limitation of Liability"" clause is relevant to the query as it establishes the framework for financial responsibility in the event of a breach, which directly impacts how parties assess their insurance needs and the potential legal precedents that may arise in disputes regarding liability and coverage.",5

11. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.","The clause you provided, titled ""LIMITATION ON LIABILITY,"" is relevant to the query regarding precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability in several ways:

1. **Scope of Liability**: The clause explicitly limits the liability of the parties to the agreement, stating that neither party shall be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages or lost profits, except in the event of a breach of a specific section (Section 11, which pertains to Confidential Information). This limitation is a common practice in contracts to manage risk and exposure to potential claims.

2. **Insurance Coverage Considerations**: In the context of insurance, parties often seek to align their liability limitations with the coverage provided by their insurance policies. For instance, if a party has insurance that covers certain types of damages, they may be more willing to accept a limitation of liability for those damages, knowing they have coverage. Conversely, if a party is not insured for certain risks, they may negotiate for broader liability to ensure they are not left exposed.

3. **Precedents and Negotiation**: The clause reflects a negotiation between the parties regarding risk allocation. Precedents in similar agreements may show how insurance coverage has influenced the terms of liability limitations. For example, if one party has a robust insurance policy that covers consequential damages, they might agree to a more stringent limitation on liability, while a party without such coverage may seek to limit their exposure differently.

4. **Legal Framework**: The enforceability of limitation of liability clauses can be influenced by the presence of insurance. Courts may consider whether a party had insurance coverage when determining the fairness and reasonableness of a limitation of liability clause. If a party can demonstrate that they have adequate insurance to cover potential liabilities, it may support the enforceability of such clauses.

In summary, the ""LIMITATION ON LIABILITY"" clause is relevant to the query as it encapsulates the principles of risk management and liability allocation that are often influenced by the parties' insurance coverage. Understanding how insurance interacts with liability limitations can provide insights into the negotiation and drafting of such clauses in contracts.",5

Nothing in this Section ​8.7 shall operate to limit or exclude any liability under Section ​8.5 [Indemnification] with respect to a Claim, or for fraud, or for breach by a Party of the provisions of Article ​7 [Confidential Information].","The clause you provided, Section 8.7 on Limitation of Liability, is relevant to the query regarding precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability in several ways:

1. **Scope of Liability**: The clause explicitly limits the liability of each party for certain types of losses, such as indirect, incidental, special, or consequential losses. This limitation is crucial in understanding how insurance coverage might influence the extent to which parties can seek recovery for losses. If a party has insurance that covers certain types of losses, they may be less inclined to pursue claims against the other party, knowing that their insurance will cover those losses.

2. **Exclusions from Limitation**: The clause specifies that certain liabilities are not limited, such as those arising from indemnification claims, fraud, or breaches of confidentiality. This indicates that while there is a general limitation on liability, there are exceptions that could be influenced by insurance coverage. For example, if a party is liable for fraud, their insurance may not cover that liability, thus making the limitation of liability clause less relevant in that context.

3. **Influence of Insurance on Risk Allocation**: The limitation of liability clause reflects a negotiated allocation of risk between the parties. Insurance coverage can play a significant role in this allocation. For instance, if one party has robust insurance coverage for certain risks, they may agree to a more limited liability clause, knowing that their insurance will cover potential claims. Conversely, if a party lacks insurance, they may seek to negotiate a broader liability clause to protect themselves.

4. **Precedents and Legal Framework**: The references to irreparable damage and the right to seek equitable relief in the external information provided suggest that courts may consider the availability of insurance coverage when interpreting and enforcing limitation of liability clauses. Courts often look at the overall fairness of the agreement and the parties' ability to bear risks, which can be influenced by their insurance arrangements.

In summary, Section 8.7 on Limitation of Liability is relevant to the query as it outlines how liability is limited between the parties and highlights the potential influence of insurance coverage on the extent of that liability. It also underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between contractual limitations and the parties' insurance policies when assessing risk and liability in legal agreements.",5

This is relevant to the query regarding precedents for insurance coverage influencing limitation of liability for several reasons:

1. **Insurance as a Risk Mitigation Tool**: The clause specifies the types and amounts of insurance that the Service Provider must maintain, which serves to mitigate risks associated with potential liabilities arising from their services. By requiring substantial coverage (e.g., $5 million for excess liability and $2 million for commercial general liability), the clause indicates that the parties recognize the importance of insurance in managing liability risks.

2. **Primary vs. Excess Coverage**: The clause includes a provision that the insurance policies must be primary and not excess to any other insurance maintained by the Owner or related parties. This is significant because it establishes that the Service Provider's insurance will respond first in the event of a claim, which can influence how liability is allocated and potentially limit the Service Provider's exposure to claims.

3. **Additional Insureds**: By requiring that the Owner and other related parties be named as additional insureds on the Service Provider's policies, the clause provides an additional layer of protection for the Owner. This can influence the limitation of liability by ensuring that the Owner can directly access the Service Provider's insurance coverage in the event of a claim, thereby potentially limiting the Owner's own liability exposure.

4. **Severability of Interests Clause**: The inclusion of a severability of interests clause means that the insurance coverage will apply separately to each insured party, which can prevent exclusions from being applied in a way that would disadvantage one party over another. This can influence how liability is assessed and limited among the parties involved.

5. **Compliance with Applicable Laws**: The requirement for the Service Provider to maintain worker's compensation insurance as required by law indicates that compliance with legal insurance requirements is a factor in determining liability. This can influence the limitation of liability by ensuring that the Service Provider is adequately insured against statutory claims, which can limit their exposure to other types of claims.

In summary, the insurance requirements outlined in the clause directly relate to the concept of limitation of liability by establishing a framework for how risks are managed and how liability is allocated among the parties. The presence of adequate insurance coverage can serve to limit the financial exposure of the Service Provider and the Owner in the event of claims arising from the services provided.",5

1. **Scope of Liability**: The clause establishes a cap on the liability of the parties involved in the agreement, limiting recoverable damages to the amount of payments made under the agreement. This limitation is significant because it sets a clear boundary on financial exposure, which can be influenced by the parties' insurance coverage.

2. **Insurance as a Risk Management Tool**: In many contracts, parties may negotiate limitations of liability based on the extent of their insurance coverage. If a party has substantial insurance coverage, they may be more willing to accept a higher limit of liability, knowing that their insurance will cover potential claims. Conversely, if a party has limited insurance, they may seek to negotiate a lower limit of liability to mitigate their risk.

3. **Legal Precedents**: The clause reflects a common practice in contractual agreements where limitations of liability are often influenced by the parties' insurance arrangements. Courts may look at the insurance coverage in determining whether the limitation of liability is reasonable and enforceable. For instance, if a party has insurance that covers certain risks, a court may uphold a limitation of liability that reflects that coverage.

4. **Exclusions from Liability**: The clause explicitly states that limitations do not apply in cases of personal injury or death caused by negligence. This aligns with legal principles that often require parties to maintain certain levels of liability insurance for such risks, thereby influencing how limitations of liability are structured in contracts.

5. **Negotiation Leverage**: The presence of insurance can serve as a negotiation tool. Parties may agree to a limitation of liability that reflects their respective insurance policies, which can lead to more favorable terms for both sides. This is particularly relevant in industries where risks are high, and insurance plays a critical role in managing those risks.

In summary, Section 28.2 on limitations of liability is directly relevant to the query as it encapsulates how insurance coverage can influence the terms of liability in a contract, reflecting both risk management practices and legal precedents in contractual negotiations.",5

This is directly relevant to your query about fixing a fee liability cap because it establishes the parameters within which one party can be held liable to the other.

Here are the key points from the clause that relate to your query:

1. **Definition of Maximum Liability**: The clause defines ""Maximum Liability"" for both the Operator and the Owner, setting a specific monetary cap for liability. For the Owner, this cap is set at One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). This directly addresses the need for a fixed fee liability cap.

2. **Aggregate Limit of Liability**: Section 7.1(a) states that no party shall be liable for an amount exceeding the Maximum Liability, which is crucial for limiting exposure to financial claims. This means that even if a party were to incur damages, their liability would not exceed the defined cap.

3. **Exclusions from Liability Cap**: The clause specifies certain exceptions where the limitation of liability does not apply, such as in cases of gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct. This is important for understanding the boundaries of the liability cap and ensuring that it does not shield a party from all forms of liability.

4. **Direct Damages Limitation**: The clause also limits recoverable damages to direct damages, explicitly excluding indirect, punitive, special, or consequential damages. This further clarifies the nature of claims that can be made and reinforces the fixed nature of the liability cap.

5. **No Duplication of Claims**: Section 7.2 emphasizes that the limitations of liability are to be calculated on an aggregate basis, meaning that claims under this agreement and any related agreements (like the MESPA) will be considered together, preventing multiple claims from exceeding the Maximum Liability.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a clear framework for liability caps, defines the maximum amounts for which parties can be held liable, and outlines the conditions under which these caps apply or may be exceeded. This is essential for managing risk and ensuring that both parties understand their financial exposure under the agreement.",5

2. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, such as breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. This is important because it clarifies the circumstances under which the liability cap is effective and when it can be exceeded.

3. **Relevance to Fixed Fee Arrangements**: In the context of fixed fee agreements, a liability cap is crucial as it provides predictability and limits the financial exposure of the parties involved. It ensures that parties can assess their risk and manage their financial commitments effectively.

4. **Claims Definition**: The clause defines what constitutes a ""Claim,"" which is essential for understanding the scope of liability that is being capped. This definition helps in determining which breaches or issues fall under the liability cap.

In summary, the ""11.3. Liability Cap"" clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations on liability between the parties, which is a fundamental aspect of managing risk in contractual agreements, particularly in fixed fee arrangements.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that a Party's liability for damages is limited to specific amounts and events. It mentions that for certain types of damages (like direct damage to physical goods or damages resulting from a material breach), the liability is capped at a maximum amount for each event and a further maximum for all events within a 12-month period.

Instead, it outlines payment obligations following the termination of the agreement, specifically detailing how payments are structured over a period of eight quarters based on Net Sales. 

However, the relevance to the query can be inferred in a few ways:

1. **Payment Structure**: The clause specifies a payment obligation that continues for a defined period (eight quarters) after termination. While it does not explicitly state a cap on liability, it does establish a framework for financial obligations that could be interpreted as a limitation on the total amount payable over time.

2. **Insurance Requirements**: The clause also mentions the requirement for maintaining commercial general liability and product liability insurance. This could indirectly relate to liability caps, as having adequate insurance coverage is often a way to manage potential liabilities arising from the agreement.

3. **Comparison to Cap on Liability**: The query mentions a cap on liability equal to 12 months' payment, which suggests a desire for a clear limit on financial exposure. The clause's structured payment over multiple quarters could be seen as a more complex approach to liability, where the total amount owed is spread out rather than capped at a single year's payment.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly establish a cap on liability equal to 12 months' payment, it does outline a payment structure that could be relevant in discussions about liability limits and financial obligations following termination of the agreement.",3

1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for ""consequential, incidental, exemplary or punitive damages,"" which are typically considered indirect damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that are not a direct result of the other party's actions (such as lost profits or lost savings), they cannot claim compensation for those losses.

2. **Cap on Direct Damages**: The clause also includes a limitation on direct damages, stating that a party's liability under the agreement cannot exceed the total amounts paid under the agreement in the twelve months preceding the event that gave rise to the claim. This establishes a clear cap on the liability for direct damages, which is relevant when considering the overall liability framework of the agreement.

3. **Legal Protection**: By limiting liability for both indirect and direct damages, the clause provides legal protection to both parties, ensuring that they are not exposed to potentially unlimited financial liability.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party's liability will include consequential, incidental, special, or other indirect damages, such as lost profits. This means that even if one party is aware that such indirect damages could occur, they cannot claim them under this agreement.

This aligns with the concept of capping liability for indirect damages, as it effectively sets a limit by stating that such damages will not be compensated at all.

2. **Types of Damages Covered**: The clause specifies that liability is limited to direct damages only. This is significant because it clarifies that the parties have agreed to restrict their potential exposure to only those damages that are directly attributable to a breach or failure to perform under the contract, thereby capping liability for any indirect or consequential damages.

3. **Awareness of Potential Damages**: The clause also notes that this limitation applies regardless of whether the parties were advised of the possibility of such indirect damages.

4. **Overall Liability Cap**: Additionally, the clause states that either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party. This serves as a further cap on liability, ensuring that the maximum exposure for either party is confined to the actual payments made under the agreement, which is a common practice in contractual agreements to manage risk.

In summary, this clause effectively caps liability for indirect damages by excluding them from recoverable damages and limiting overall liability to direct damages and actual payments made, which is crucial for managing risk in contractual relationships.",5

Here's how it connects:

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause specifies a ""Liability Cap,"" which is the maximum amount one party can be held liable to the other under the agreement. This is a key aspect of a liability cap, as it limits the financial exposure of one party in the event of a breach or other claims.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to certain situations, such as:
   - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).
   - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).
   - Intentional misconduct and gross negligence.

   This means that in cases of serious wrongdoing or specific breaches, the party may be liable for amounts exceeding the Liability Cap. This is significant because it indicates that while there is a cap on liability, it is not absolute and does not protect a party from all forms of liability.

3. **Scope of Liability**: The clause defines ""liability"" broadly, encompassing various claims and damages that may arise from the agreement. This broad definition is important in understanding the potential implications of the liability cap and the circumstances under which it applies.

4. **Unilateral Nature**: The term ""unilateral"" in your query suggests that the liability cap may apply to one party but not the other. In this clause, it appears that the cap is set for one party's liability to the other, which aligns with the concept of unilateral liability caps. However, the exclusions indicate that the protection is not absolute and can be challenged under certain conditions.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query about unilateral liability caps as it establishes a framework for limiting liability between the parties while also outlining specific exceptions where the cap does not apply, thereby affecting the overall risk and exposure of the parties involved in the agreement.",5

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause specifies a ""Liability Cap,"" which is the maximum amount one party can be held liable to the other under the agreement. This is a key aspect of a unilateral liability cap, as it limits the extent of financial responsibility one party has towards the other.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause includes specific exclusions where the Liability Cap does not apply. These exclusions are significant because they indicate circumstances under which a party can be held liable beyond the cap. For instance:
   - Breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).

A unilateral liability cap is a provision in a contract that limits the amount one party can be held liable to the other party for certain claims or breaches of the agreement.

In this clause, the liability of one party (in this case, the Distributor) to the other party (Accuray) is capped at the total amount of purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for products over the twelve months preceding the notification of the claim. This means that regardless of the nature of the claim, as long as it does not fall under the exceptions listed (such as breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional breaches, or non-compliance with mandatory laws), the maximum liability is limited to a specific financial amount.

The relevance to the query about unilateral liability caps lies in the fact that this clause effectively establishes a limit on liability for one party (the Distributor) in favor of the other (Accuray). It protects the Distributor from potentially unlimited financial exposure due to claims arising from breaches of the agreement, which is a common feature in contracts to manage risk and liability. 

Overall, this clause exemplifies how a unilateral liability cap operates within a contractual framework, providing a clear boundary on the financial responsibilities of one party in relation to the other.",5

proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause provided, specifically Section 11.4 on ""Limitation of Liability,"" is relevant to the query about ""unilateral liability cap"" because it outlines the limitations on liability for both parties involved in the agreement—Fiserv and the Merchant. 

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a specific monetary limit (AUD 50,000) on the aggregate liability of both parties for losses arising from any cause in connection with the agreement. This is essentially a cap on the amount that either party can be held liable for, which aligns with the concept of a liability cap.

2. **Unilateral Nature**: While the clause sets a cap on liability for both parties, the term ""unilateral liability cap"" typically refers to a situation where only one party's liability is limited, while the other party may not have a similar limitation. In this case, the clause does not specify a unilateral cap, as it applies equally to both Fiserv and the Merchant. However, it does highlight the importance of understanding how liability is limited in contractual agreements.

3. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause also specifies exceptions to the liability cap, indicating that certain obligations (like remitting transaction proceeds and payment obligations related to services) are not subject to this limitation. This is crucial because it means that even though there is a cap, there are significant obligations that can lead to liability beyond that cap.

In summary, while the clause does not represent a unilateral liability cap, it is relevant to the concept as it defines the limits of liability for both parties and outlines exceptions where those limits do not apply. Understanding this clause is essential for assessing the risk and potential financial exposure in the context of the agreement.",4

1. **Definition of Liability Cap**: A liability cap is a contractual provision that limits the amount of damages one party can recover from another party in the event of a breach of contract or other claims. In this case, the clause specifies that the total aggregate liability of one party to another for any claims related to breaches of the agreement is limited to a specific amount.

2. **Scope of the Cap**: The clause outlines exceptions to the liability cap, indicating that it does not apply to:
   - Breaches associated with unauthorized use of intellectual property.
   - Intentional breaches or willful misconduct.
   - Non-compliance with mandatory applicable laws or regulations.

3. **Calculation of the Cap**: The liability cap is quantified as the total amount of purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for products over the twelve months preceding the claim notification. This establishes a clear financial limit on potential liability, which is a key aspect of a unilateral liability cap.

4. **Unilateral Nature**: The term ""unilateral"" suggests that the liability cap may apply to one party's liability to the other, rather than mutual liability. In this clause, it appears that the cap is set for one party's liability (the Distributor's liability to Accuray) while also outlining specific exceptions where the cap does not apply.

5. **Relevance to Risk Management**: Such clauses are often included in contracts to manage risk and provide predictability regarding potential financial exposure. This is particularly important in commercial agreements where the parties want to limit their liability for unforeseen damages.

In summary, the clause you provided is a clear example of a liability cap that limits the financial exposure of one party to another in the context of breaches of the agreement, while also specifying exceptions where this cap does not apply.

Here’s how the clause relates to the query:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause specifies that the total aggregate liability of one party to another for any claims related to breaches of the agreement is capped at a certain amount. In this case, it is limited to the total purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for products over the twelve months preceding the claim notification. This establishes a clear financial limit on potential liabilities, which is a key characteristic of a mutual liability cap.

2. **Exclusions**: The clause also outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, such as breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. This is important because it clarifies the boundaries of the liability cap, indicating that certain serious breaches may still expose a party to unlimited liability.

3. **Mutuality**: While the clause specifically mentions the liability of one party to another, it implies a mutual understanding that both parties are subject to similar limitations on liability. This mutuality is a common feature in liability cap clauses, ensuring that both parties have a clear understanding of their potential exposure in the event of a breach.

In summary, the ""11.3. Liability Cap"" clause serves to limit the financial exposure of the parties involved in the agreement, which is the essence of a mutual liability cap.

This is referred to as the ""Liability Cap,"" which is set at AUD 50,000. This means that neither party can claim damages exceeding this amount for losses related to the agreement.

2. **Mutuality**: The term ""mutual liability cap"" implies that both parties agree to limit their liabilities to each other to a specified amount. In this clause, the limitation is mutual because it applies equally to both Fiserv and the Merchant, thereby protecting both parties from excessive financial exposure.

3. **Exceptions to the Cap**: The clause also outlines specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply. These exceptions include obligations related to the remittance of transaction proceeds and payment obligations for services and fees. This is important because it clarifies that while there is a cap on general liability, certain critical financial obligations are not limited by this cap, ensuring that both parties fulfill their essential financial responsibilities.

4. **Legal Framework**: The clause is structured to provide a clear legal framework for liability, which is a common practice in contracts to manage risk and expectations. It helps both parties understand the extent of their financial exposure and the limits of their liability, which is crucial in any contractual relationship.

1. **Liability Insurance**: The clause specifies that each party must maintain certain types of insurance, including commercial general liability insurance with a significant coverage limit of at least $5,000,000 per occurrence. This requirement indicates that each party is expected to have financial protection against potential liabilities that may arise from their actions or failures under the agreement.

2. **Risk Mitigation**: By requiring both parties to carry insurance, the clause serves to mitigate the financial risks associated with potential liabilities. This is particularly important in contracts where the parties may be exposed to significant risks, as it ensures that there are resources available to cover claims or damages that may arise.

3. **Additional Insured**: The clause also states that each party must name the other as an additional insured under their liability insurance policies. This further emphasizes the mutual nature of the liability coverage, as both parties are protected under each other's insurance policies.

4. **Context of Liability Cap**: In the context of a mutual liability cap, this clause indirectly supports the idea that both parties are responsible for their actions and have a financial safety net in place. A mutual liability cap would typically limit the amount one party can claim from the other in the event of a breach or other liability. The insurance requirements in this clause could be seen as a way to ensure that, even if a liability cap is in place, there are sufficient resources to cover claims up to the limits specified.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly establish a mutual liability cap, it is relevant because it outlines the insurance obligations that help manage and mitigate liability risks between the parties, which is a key consideration when discussing liability caps in a contract.",4

Here's how it connects:

1. **Liability Caps**: The clause explicitly states that ""IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT."" This establishes a specific cap on D2's liability, which is a critical aspect of liability limitations in contracts. If the other party (the Licensee) has a different liability cap, this creates a situation where the two parties have different limits on their potential liabilities.

2. **Carveouts**: The clause also mentions that neither party shall be liable for ""lost profits or any consequential, special, incidental, or indirect damages."" This indicates that certain types of damages are excluded from liability, which can be considered a carveout. If the Licensee has different carveouts or exclusions for liability, this further illustrates the differences in how each party's liability is treated under the agreement.

3. **Implications for Enforcement**: The limitations and carveouts outlined in this clause can affect how each party enforces their rights and remedies under the agreement. For instance, if one party has a broader scope of liability or fewer exclusions, they may have more avenues for recourse in the event of a breach.

4. **Negotiation and Risk Allocation**: The presence of different liability caps and carveouts reflects the negotiation dynamics between the parties and how they allocate risk. Each party may have different risk tolerances and business considerations that lead to these differences.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for certain types of damages, such as lost profits, lost revenues, or any incidental, indirect, punitive, special, or consequential damages. This sets a baseline for liability, indicating that there are limits to what one party can claim against the other in the event of a breach or performance issue.

2. **Different Liability Caps**: If the parties have different liability caps, this clause would need to be tailored to reflect those differences. For example, one party might agree to a lower cap on liability for direct damages, while the other party might have a higher cap or different exclusions. The clause as it stands does not specify different caps, but it could be modified to include specific caps for each party.

3. **Carveouts**: The clause does not currently include any carveouts, which are exceptions to the limitations on liability. For instance, parties might agree that certain types of breaches (e.g., breaches of confidentiality or intellectual property rights) are not subject to the limitations outlined in this clause. If the parties have different carveouts, this would need to be clearly articulated in the agreement to avoid ambiguity.

4. **Relevance to Specific Performance**: The external information provided discusses the right to specific performance and equitable relief, which may not be limited by the liability clause. This means that even if the liability for damages is capped or limited, the parties may still seek specific performance or injunctions to enforce the terms of the agreement, which could be a significant consideration in negotiations.

In summary, the ""Limitation of Liability"" clause is a critical component of the agreement that addresses how liability is handled between the parties.

Here’s how it connects to the query:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable to the other for certain types of damages, specifically special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages. This sets a baseline for liability that both parties agree upon, which is crucial when discussing different liability caps.

2. **Scope of Liability**: By defining what types of damages are excluded from liability, the clause creates a clear understanding of the risks each party is willing to accept. This is particularly important if one party has a higher risk tolerance or a different business model that may expose them to greater potential damages.

3. **Carveouts**: While the clause does not explicitly mention different caps or carveouts, it does imply that there may be specific circumstances under which liability could be limited differently for each party. For example, if one party has a higher cap on liability for certain breaches (like gross negligence or willful misconduct), that would need to be clearly articulated in the agreement, potentially as a carveout to the general limitation of liability.

4. **Negotiation of Terms**: The existence of this clause suggests that the parties have negotiated their respective liabilities and have agreed to limit their exposure to certain types of damages. If one party has a different liability cap or specific carveouts, those would need to be detailed in the agreement to ensure clarity and enforceability.

5. **Legal Remedies**: The references to waiving rights to recover certain damages and the acknowledgment of negligence indicate that the parties are aware of the legal implications of their agreement. This is relevant when considering how different liability caps might interact with the legal remedies available to each party.

In summary, the ""Limitation of Liability"" clause is a foundational element that sets the stage for understanding how liability is managed between the parties.

Here's how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages, which is a common limitation in contracts. This indicates that both parties have agreed to cap their liability in certain circumstances, which is a key aspect of liability caps.

2. **Exclusions (Carveouts)**: The clause mentions exceptions under Sections 13(a) and 13(b). This implies that there are specific situations or types of damages for which the limitation does not apply, effectively creating carveouts. These carveouts are important because they allow for certain liabilities to be excluded from the general limitation, which can lead to different liability caps for each party depending on the nature of the damages or breaches.

3. **Different Liability Caps**: While the clause does not explicitly state different caps for each party, the presence of exceptions suggests that the parties may have negotiated different terms regarding liability. For instance, one party might have a higher cap or different exclusions than the other, depending on the specifics of Sections 13(a) and 13(b).

4. **Legal Framework**: The clause aligns with the legal principles discussed in the external information, which emphasizes the importance of equitable remedies and the acknowledgment of irreparable harm. This context reinforces the idea that liability limitations and carveouts are critical in managing risks and expectations in contractual relationships.

In summary, the ""LIMITATION OF LIABILITY"" clause is relevant as it outlines the framework for liability between the parties, indicating that there are caps and exceptions that could lead to different liability exposures for each party, which is central to your query about differing liability caps and carveouts.",5

In no event will either party be liable to the other for any special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
b) Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party.","The clause provided, titled ""LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,"" is relevant to the query regarding two parties having different liability caps and/or carveouts because it outlines the limitations and exclusions of liability for both parties involved in the agreement. Here’s how it connects to the query:

1. **Liability Caps**: The clause specifies that each party's liability is limited to ""the amounts actually paid by the other party."" This indicates a cap on liability, meaning that neither party can claim damages beyond the amount they have paid to the other. If the parties have different amounts paid, this could lead to different liability caps for each party, depending on their respective financial transactions under the agreement.

2. **Carveouts**: The clause also references specific sections (19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2), and (b)(iii)(3)) that may provide exceptions to the general limitation of liability. These carveouts could allow for certain types of damages or liabilities to be excluded from the limitation, potentially leading to different liability exposures for each party based on the circumstances outlined in those sections.

3. **Direct vs. Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages, which is a common limitation in contracts. This further emphasizes the need for clarity on what constitutes direct damages and how they are calculated, which could differ between the parties based on their specific situations.

In summary, this clause is crucial in understanding how liability is structured between the two parties, particularly in terms of caps and exceptions, which is central to the query about differing liability caps and carveouts.",5

proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,

failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause you provided, ""11.4 Limitation of liability,"" is directly relevant to your query about a cap on liability without carveouts. 

1. **Cap on Liability**: The clause establishes a clear cap on the aggregate liability of both parties (Fiserv and the Merchant) to AUD 50,000. This means that, regardless of the circumstances or legal theories involved, neither party can be held liable for more than this specified amount.

2. **Carveouts**: The clause includes specific exceptions (or carveouts) to the liability cap. It states that the cap does not apply to:
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit proceeds from the Merchant’s transactions processed under the agreement.
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations related to services, network security fees, and other amounts it is liable for under the agreement, including regulatory obligations due to a party's failure to perform.

If you are looking for a cap on liability without any carveouts, this clause would not meet that criterion, as it explicitly lists exceptions where the cap does not apply.

2. **No Carveouts**: The clause does not include any exceptions or carveouts that would allow for higher liability in certain circumstances (e.g., gross negligence, willful misconduct, etc.). This means that regardless of the nature of the claim (contractual, tortious, etc.), the liability remains capped.

3. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause also specifies that CarMax will not be liable for certain types of damages, such as lost profits or consequential damages, further reinforcing the limitation on liability.

1. **Cap on Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the amount recoverable by one party is limited to the total payments made under the agreement. This is a clear cap on liability, meaning that regardless of the circumstances, the maximum amount one party can claim from the other is predetermined and does not exceed the total payments made.

2. **No Carveouts**: The clause does not provide any exceptions or ""carveouts"" that would allow for higher liability in certain situations (except for personal injury or death caused by negligence, which is a standard legal requirement). This means that the cap applies uniformly to all claims arising from the agreement, regardless of the nature of the claim (negligence, willful misconduct, etc.), thus reinforcing the idea of a strict limitation on liability.

3. **Legal Context**: The clause aligns with the general legal principle that parties can agree to limit their liability in contracts, provided that such limitations are clear and unambiguous. The absence of carveouts indicates that the parties intended to maintain a strict limit on liability, which can be beneficial for risk management.

In legal contracts, a liability cap is a provision that limits the amount one party can be held liable for damages arising from the contract. However, parties often include carveouts to this cap, which are exceptions where the cap does not apply. 

In the clause you shared, the Liability Cap is set at AUD 50,000.00, but there are specific carveouts where this cap does not apply:

1. **Obligation to remit proceeds**: The first carveout states that Fiserv's obligation to remit the proceeds of the Merchant's transactions processed under the agreement is not subject to the liability cap. This means that if Fiserv fails to remit these proceeds, it can be liable for more than AUD 50,000.00.

2. **Merchant's payment obligations**: The second carveout indicates that the Merchant's payment obligations related to services, network security fees, and other amounts for which it is liable under the agreement are also exempt from the liability cap. This includes amounts due to regulatory authorities resulting from the Merchant's failure to perform its obligations.

These carveouts are significant because they ensure that certain critical obligations are not limited by the liability cap, allowing for greater accountability and protection for the parties involved in those specific areas. This is a common practice in contracts to balance the interests of both parties while still providing a level of risk management through the liability cap.",5

This means that if a claim arises, the maximum amount CarMax would be liable for is limited to the cost of those products or services. Additionally, the clause explicitly states that CarMax will not be liable for certain types of damages, such as loss of profits, incidental damages, or punitive damages.

In the context of liability cap carveouts, this clause could be analyzed to determine if there are any exceptions to the liability cap.

The provided external information discusses specific performance and equitable remedies, which may also be relevant in situations where a party seeks to enforce the agreement despite the liability cap.

This is relevant to the query about ""liability cap carveouts"" because it establishes a general cap on the amount recoverable by one party from the other in the event of a breach or nonperformance of obligations under the agreement.

### Key Points of Relevance:

1. **General Limitation of Liability**: The clause states that, except for personal injury or death caused by negligence (where no limit applies), the liability of either party is capped at the total amount of payments made under the agreement. This is a typical limitation of liability clause that seeks to protect parties from excessive claims.

2. **Carveouts**: The mention of exceptions (or carveouts) is crucial. The clause explicitly states that the limitation does not apply to personal injury or death caused by negligence. This means that while the parties have agreed to limit their liability in most circumstances, there are specific situations (like negligence leading to personal injury or death) where the cap does not apply. This is a common practice in contracts to ensure that parties remain accountable for serious breaches that could cause significant harm.

3. **Risk Management**: By including such carveouts, the parties are managing their risk exposure. They acknowledge that certain types of liability (like those resulting in personal injury) are too significant to be limited by a cap, thus ensuring that they can be held fully accountable in those scenarios.

4. **Legal Context**: The clause aligns with the legal principles discussed in the external information provided, which emphasizes the importance of specific performance and equitable remedies in cases of breach. While the limitation of liability seeks to cap financial exposure, the right to seek specific performance or equitable relief remains intact, particularly in cases where monetary damages are deemed inadequate.

In summary, Section 28.2 is relevant to the query about liability cap carveouts as it establishes a framework for limiting liability while also recognizing specific exceptions where such limitations do not apply, thereby balancing the interests of both parties in the agreement.",5

   - Non-compliance with mandatory applicable laws or regulations.

   These exclusions indicate that while there is a cap on liability, certain serious breaches or legal obligations are not subject to this limitation. This aligns with the legal principle that parties cannot contractually limit liability for violations of mandatory laws or regulations, which is often upheld in legal contexts.

3. **Compliance with Law**: The reference to non-compliance with mandatory applicable law or regulation suggests that the parties acknowledge the importance of adhering to legal standards. This is crucial because any attempt to limit liability for such non-compliance would likely be unenforceable under the law.

In summary, the clause outlines a structured approach to liability, providing a cap while also recognizing the necessity of compliance with legal obligations. This balance is essential in contractual agreements to protect both parties while ensuring adherence to the law.",5
cap on liability subject to law,d087a6993d,"11.4 Limitation of liability
Fiserv’s and the Merchant’s aggregate liability to the other for losses arising from any cause
(regardless of the form of action or legal theory) in connection with this Agreement will be limited to
AUD 50,000.00 (Liability Cap). The Liability Cap will not apply to: (1) Fiserv’s obligation to remit the
proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause you provided, titled ""11.4 Limitation of liability,"" is directly relevant to the query regarding a cap on liability subject to law. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Cap on Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the aggregate liability of Fiserv and the Merchant is limited to AUD 50,000. This establishes a clear cap on the amount that either party can be held liable for losses arising from the agreement, which is a common practice in contracts to manage risk.

2. **Exceptions to the Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply. These exceptions include:
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit proceeds from transactions processed under the agreement.
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations related to services and fees, including regulatory obligations due to a party's failure to perform.

3. **Subject to Law**: While the clause does not explicitly mention that the cap is subject to law, it is generally understood in legal contexts that any limitation of liability must comply with applicable laws and regulations. For instance, certain jurisdictions may have laws that prevent parties from limiting liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Therefore, the enforceability of the liability cap may be subject to legal scrutiny based on the governing law of the agreement.

4. **Legal Framework**: The reference to ""subject to law"" in the query implies that while the parties agree to a limitation of liability, they must also consider the legal framework that governs the agreement. This means that if the law prohibits such limitations in certain circumstances, the cap may not be enforceable.

In summary, the clause establishes a liability cap while also implicitly acknowledging that its enforceability is subject to applicable laws, which aligns with the query regarding a cap on liability subject to law.",5

IN NO EVENT SHALL D2'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR OWED BY LICENSEE TO D2 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause you provided, titled ""LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,"" is directly relevant to the query regarding a cap on liability subject to law. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for lost profits or any consequential, special, incidental, or indirect damages. This establishes a clear limitation on the types of damages that can be claimed, which is a common practice in contracts to manage risk.

2. **Cap on Liability**: The clause further specifies that D2's liability is capped at the total amount paid or owed by the Licensee to D2 under the agreement. This is a direct application of a cap on liability, meaning that regardless of the circumstances, D2 cannot be held liable for more than this specified amount.

3. **Subject to Law**: While the clause does not explicitly mention that these limitations are subject to law, it is generally understood in legal contexts that any contractual limitations must comply with applicable laws. This means that if a jurisdiction has laws that invalidate certain limitations or caps on liability (for example, in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct), those laws would take precedence over the contractual terms.

4. **Relevance to Legal Remedies**: The external information provided discusses the right to seek specific performance and injunctions, indicating that certain legal remedies may be available despite the limitations on liability. This aligns with the idea that while parties may limit their liability in a contract, they cannot completely waive their obligations under the law, especially in cases where irreparable harm is claimed.

In summary, the ""LIMITATION OF LIABILITY"" clause is relevant to the query as it outlines the specific limitations and caps on liability between the parties, while also implicitly acknowledging that such limitations must be compliant with applicable laws.",5

proceeds of the Merchant’s transactions that are processed under this Agreement (after accounting
for all offsetting obligations); or (2) the Merchant’s payment obligations related to the Services,
Network Security Fees and other amounts for which it is liable under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, amounts imposed by a regulatory authority that are specifically due to a party’s
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement).","The clause provided, specifically Section 11.4 on Limitation of Liability, is relevant to the query regarding a compliance with law carveout to the cap on liability because it outlines the circumstances under which the liability cap does not apply. 

In this clause, the Liability Cap of AUD 50,000 is established as the maximum amount that either party (Fiserv or the Merchant) can be held liable for losses arising from the agreement. However, there are specific exceptions to this cap, which are critical in the context of compliance with laws:

1. **Fiserv’s obligation to remit proceeds**: This exception indicates that Fiserv is still liable for the proceeds of the Merchant's transactions processed under the agreement, regardless of the liability cap. This is important for compliance with financial regulations and ensures that Fiserv cannot limit its liability in this area, which is often governed by law.

2. **Merchant’s payment obligations**: The second exception states that the Merchant's payment obligations related to services, network security fees, and other amounts for which it is liable under the agreement are not subject to the liability cap. This includes amounts imposed by regulatory authorities due to a party's failure to perform its obligations. This is particularly relevant for compliance with laws, as it ensures that the Merchant cannot limit its liability for regulatory fines or penalties that arise from non-compliance with applicable laws.

In summary, the clause establishes a framework where certain obligations, particularly those related to compliance with laws and regulations, are exempt from the liability cap. This ensures that both parties remain accountable for their legal obligations, which is crucial for maintaining compliance with applicable laws.",5

Specifically, it establishes a ""Liability Cap,"" which is the maximum amount one party can be held liable to the other under the terms of the agreement. However, there are specific exceptions to this cap, which are crucial in the context of your query regarding compliance with law carveouts.

1. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: 
   - The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to (1) material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5) and (2) indemnification obligations (Section 7.1). This means that if a party breaches confidentiality or fails to meet indemnification obligations, they can be held liable beyond the established cap.
   - Additionally, the Liability Cap does not apply to cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This is significant because it indicates that if a party acts in bad faith or with extreme carelessness, they can be held liable for damages that exceed the cap.

2. **Compliance with Law Carveout**: 
   - While the provided clause does not explicitly mention compliance with law as a carveout, it is common in legal agreements to include such provisions. A compliance with law carveout would typically mean that if a party fails to comply with applicable laws or regulations, they would not be protected by the Liability Cap. This is important because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for legal violations simply by relying on the cap.
   - In practice, if a party's actions or omissions result in a violation of law, they could be held liable for damages that exceed the Liability Cap, similar to the exceptions already outlined in the clause.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a framework for liability limitations while also indicating that certain serious breaches (like confidentiality and indemnification) and potentially unlawful actions can lead to liability beyond the cap. If a compliance with law carveout were to be included, it would further reinforce the principle that parties must adhere to legal standards and could be held accountable for violations without the protection of the Liability Cap.",4

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states exceptions to the Liability Cap in subsections 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. These exceptions include:
   - **Material Breach of Confidentiality**: This indicates that if a party breaches confidentiality obligations, they can be held liable beyond the cap.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: If a party has indemnification obligations under Section 7.1, those obligations are also exempt from the Liability Cap.
   - **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: If a party acts with intentional misconduct or gross negligence, they can be held liable beyond the cap.

3. **Compliance with Law Carveout**: While the provided clause does not explicitly mention a ""compliance with law"" carveout, it is common in contracts to include such carveouts to ensure that parties are held accountable for violations of applicable laws and regulations. If a compliance with law carveout were to be included, it would typically state that the Liability Cap does not apply to liabilities arising from a party's failure to comply with applicable laws.

4. **Relevance to Compliance**: If the parties are required to comply with certain laws and regulations, and a breach of those laws results in liability, a compliance with law carveout would ensure that the Liability Cap does not limit the parties' exposure to such liabilities. This is important for protecting the parties from legal repercussions that could arise from non-compliance.

In summary, while the clause does not directly address a compliance with law carveout, it establishes a framework for liability that could be expanded to include such a carveout.

In the context of your query regarding a ""compliance with law carveout to cap on liability,"" this clause is relevant because it establishes a framework for liability limitations while also suggesting that there may be exceptions to these limitations. A ""carveout"" typically refers to specific exceptions to a general rule or limitation. In this case, the clause mentions that the limitation of liability does not apply to obligations to indemnify a party for claims made by third parties. 

To incorporate a compliance with law carveout, the clause could be modified to explicitly state that the limitations on liability do not apply in cases where a party is found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations. This would mean that if a party's actions or failures to act result in legal non-compliance, they could still be held liable for damages, despite the general limitations outlined in the clause.

In summary, while the current clause limits liability for certain types of damages, a compliance with law carveout would ensure that parties remain accountable for legal compliance, thereby allowing for liability in cases of legal violations, which is an important consideration in contractual agreements.",4

In the context of your query regarding a ""compliance with law carveout to cap on liability,"" this clause is relevant because it establishes a framework for liability limitations while also implicitly suggesting that there may be exceptions to this cap. A ""compliance with law carveout"" would typically mean that if a party's actions or omissions violate applicable laws or regulations, they may not be able to rely on the liability cap as a defense. 

In other words, if a party's liability arises from a breach of law (for example, regulatory noncompliance), the cap on liability may not apply, allowing the injured party to seek damages beyond the specified limit. This is important for ensuring that parties remain accountable for legal compliance, even when they have agreed to limit their financial exposure under the contract.

To summarize, while Section 28.2 sets a cap on liability, a compliance with law carveout would clarify that this cap does not apply in cases of legal violations, ensuring that parties cannot escape liability for unlawful conduct simply by invoking the limitation of liability clause.",4

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This is a common provision in contracts to protect parties from excessive financial exposure.

2. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause specifically states that the Liability Cap does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.

3. **Other Exceptions**: Additionally, the clause mentions that the Liability Cap does not apply to material breaches of confidentiality or to claims arising from intentional misconduct or gross negligence. These exceptions further illustrate the intent to allow for full accountability in serious situations, regardless of the cap.

Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause provided, specifically Section 14.4 on Indemnification, is relevant to the query regarding an indemnification carveout to a cap on liability because it outlines the obligations of one party (the indemnitor) to indemnify and hold harmless another party (the indemnitee) from various losses and expenses arising from specific events related to the operation of a franchised business.

### Key Points of Relevance:

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause establishes a broad indemnification obligation where the indemnitor agrees to cover losses and expenses incurred by the indemnitees due to claims arising from the indemnitor's operations. This is a critical aspect of indemnification agreements, as it defines the scope of protection provided to the indemnitees.

2. **Exclusions from Indemnification**: The clause includes a specific carveout stating that indemnification does not apply to liabilities arising from the gross negligence of the indemnitees. This is an important limitation that can be seen as a carveout to the general indemnification obligation, which is relevant when considering caps on liability. It indicates that the indemnitor is not responsible for certain types of claims, thus potentially affecting the overall liability exposure.

3. **Definition of Losses and Expenses**: The clause provides a comprehensive definition of what constitutes ""losses and expenses,"" including compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and other costs. This detailed definition is crucial when discussing caps on liability, as it clarifies what types of damages may be subject to indemnification and whether they fall within any agreed-upon limits.

4. **Defense and Settlement**: The clause also outlines the process for defense and settlement of claims, indicating that the indemnitee may assume the defense but is not obligated to do so. This aspect can influence the overall liability exposure and the effectiveness of the indemnification, especially if the indemnitee incurs significant legal costs.

5. **Potential Impact on Liability Caps**: If there is a cap on liability in the overall agreement, the indemnification clause may need to be carefully reviewed to determine how it interacts with that cap. For instance, if indemnification obligations are not capped, the indemnitor could face unlimited liability for certain claims, which may not align with the overall intent of capping liability in other sections of the agreement.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the indemnification clause is relevant to the query about an indemnification carveout to a cap on liability because it defines the indemnitor's responsibilities, outlines exclusions, and specifies the types of losses covered. Understanding these elements is essential for assessing how indemnification interacts with any liability caps established in the broader contractual framework.",5

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum liability (referred to as ""Liability Cap"") that one party can owe to the other in relation to the agreement. This is a common provision in contracts to limit potential financial exposure.

2. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause specifically states that the Liability Cap does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1. This means that any claims or liabilities arising from indemnification (which typically involves one party agreeing to compensate the other for certain damages or losses) are excluded from the cap. This is a critical carveout because it allows for full recovery of indemnification claims without being limited by the Liability Cap.

3. **Other Exceptions**: Additionally, the clause mentions that the Liability Cap does not apply to material breaches of confidentiality or to claims arising from intentional misconduct or gross negligence. These exceptions further illustrate the intent to ensure that certain serious breaches or obligations (like indemnification) are not limited by the overall cap on liability.

It explicitly states that, with the exception of liability arising from Section 9.3 (which pertains to Intellectual Property Infringement), neither party shall be liable for indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages. Additionally, it limits the liability of each party to the amount they have earned under the revenue-sharing provisions in the twelve months preceding the claim.

This clause is relevant to your query regarding the ""IP infringement exception to cap on liability"" for the following reasons:

1. **Explicit Exception for IP Infringement**: The clause clearly states that any liability arising from intellectual property infringement (as referenced in Section 9.3) is exempt from the limitations imposed in Section 9.4. This means that if one party infringes on the intellectual property rights of the other, they cannot rely on the limitations of liability set forth in this section to avoid or reduce their responsibility for damages.

2. **Protection of IP Rights**: By carving out an exception for IP infringement, the clause emphasizes the importance of intellectual property rights and acknowledges that breaches in this area can lead to significant harm that may not be adequately addressed by the standard limitations on liability. This aligns with the general legal principle that IP infringement can cause irreparable harm, which may necessitate remedies beyond mere monetary compensation.

3. **Encouragement of Compliance**: The exception serves as a deterrent against potential infringement, as parties are aware that they could face full liability for any damages resulting from such actions, rather than being limited by the cap on liability that applies to other types of claims.

In summary, this clause is crucial in establishing that while there are general limitations on liability, any claims related to intellectual property infringement are treated with greater seriousness and are not subject to those same limitations, thereby providing a safeguard for the parties' intellectual property rights.",5

Here's how it connects:

1. **Liability Cap Overview**: The clause establishes a general limitation on the total aggregate liability of one party to another for claims arising from breaches of the agreement. This cap is set to the amount of purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for products in the twelve months preceding the claim notification.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states exceptions to this liability cap. One of these exceptions is for any liability relating to ""any breach associated with the unauthorized use of Intellectual Property."" This means that if a party is found to have infringed upon or improperly used the intellectual property of the other party, this specific type of liability is not subject to the cap. 

3. **Implications**: By including this exception, the clause ensures that parties cannot limit their liability for serious breaches involving IP infringement. This is significant because IP rights are often critical to a business's value and operations, and allowing a cap on liability in such cases could undermine the protection of those rights.

4. **Legal Protection**: The inclusion of this exception serves to protect the intellectual property rights of the parties involved, ensuring that if one party infringes on the other's IP, they can be held fully accountable without the limitation imposed by the liability cap.

In summary, Section 11.3 is relevant to your query as it outlines the specific exception to the liability cap for claims related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, thereby emphasizing the importance of protecting IP rights in the context of the agreement.",5

1. **Explicit Exception for IP Infringement**: The clause specifically states that there is an exception for breaches associated with the unauthorized use of intellectual property. This means that if one party infringes on the other party's intellectual property rights, the liability cap that typically limits damages will not apply. This is significant because it allows the injured party to seek remedies beyond the standard limitations set forth in the agreement.

2. **Liability Cap**: The clause outlines a general liability cap that limits the total aggregate liability of one party to another for claims related to breaches of the agreement. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for certain types of liability, including those related to IP infringement. This indicates that the parties recognize the importance of protecting intellectual property rights and are willing to allow for greater liability in cases of infringement.

3. **Protection of Rights**: By including this exception, the clause underscores the importance of intellectual property rights in the context of the agreement. It acknowledges that breaches involving IP can cause significant harm that may not be adequately compensated by the standard liability cap, thus justifying the need for a different treatment of such claims.

4. **Legal Remedies**: The clause also aligns with the legal principles mentioned in the external information, which discuss the availability of equitable remedies (like injunctions) in cases of irreparable harm due to breaches of the agreement. This further emphasizes that IP infringement is taken seriously and that the parties may seek immediate legal remedies to prevent or address such breaches.

In summary, this clause is crucial as it establishes that claims related to unauthorized use of intellectual property are exempt from the liability cap, allowing for potentially greater damages and legal remedies in the event of such breaches. This reflects a common practice in contracts to ensure that parties are held accountable for protecting intellectual property rights.",5

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,"" is directly relevant to your query regarding the exception to the cap on liability for intellectual property (IP) infringement. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Exemption for IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply to claims or liabilities arising from the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if either party infringes on someone else's IP rights, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages that may arise from that infringement.

2. **Scope of Liability**: By excluding IP infringement from the limitation of liability, the clause acknowledges the seriousness of IP rights and the potential for significant damages that can result from such infringements. This is important because IP infringement can lead to substantial financial losses, reputational harm, and legal consequences, which the parties agree should not be capped.

3. **Legal Remedies**: The external information you provided discusses the availability of equitable remedies (like injunctions) in the event of breaches of the agreement. This aligns with the idea that IP infringement is a serious matter that may require immediate legal action to prevent further harm, reinforcing the notion that liability for such claims should not be limited.

4. **Survival of the Clause**: The clause also states that it shall survive the termination or expiration of the agreement. This means that even after the agreement ends, the parties remain liable for any IP infringement claims, ensuring ongoing protection for third-party IP rights.

In summary, this clause is relevant because it establishes a clear exception to the general limitation of liability, emphasizing the importance of protecting intellectual property rights and ensuring that parties cannot evade responsibility for IP infringement through contractual limitations.",5

1. **Exemption for IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that there are exceptions to the general limitation of liability.

This means that if one party infringes on the other party's intellectual property rights, they can be held liable for damages without being limited by the cap that would otherwise apply to other types of claims.

2. **Broader Context of Liability**: The clause also outlines that the total aggregate liability for claims related to breaches of the agreement is generally limited to the amount paid for products in the preceding twelve months. However, this limitation does not apply to claims related to IP infringement, intentional breaches, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. This reinforces the importance of protecting intellectual property rights, as the parties recognize that such breaches can cause significant harm that may not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone.

3. **Legal Remedies**: The external information you provided highlights the parties' agreement on the potential for irreparable damage and the right to seek injunctive relief in the event of a breach.

Here's how it connects:

1. **Exemption for IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that liability arising from Section 9.3, which pertains to intellectual property infringement, is exempt from the limitations imposed in the rest of Section 9.4. This means that if a party is found liable for infringing on a third party's intellectual property rights, the usual caps on liability (both in terms of types of damages and the maximum amount recoverable) do not apply.

2. **Scope of Liability**: The clause outlines that, aside from the exceptions for IP infringement, neither party can be held liable for indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages. This limitation is significant because it protects both parties from extensive financial exposure, except in cases of IP infringement, where the potential damages could be substantial.

3. **Cap on Liability**: The clause also sets a cap on liability for other claims, limiting it to the amount earned under the revenue-sharing provisions in the preceding twelve months. However, since IP infringement claims are excluded from this cap, a party could potentially face liability that exceeds this limit if they infringe on a third party's IP rights.

In summary, this clause establishes a clear exception for liability related to intellectual property infringement, allowing for greater exposure and potential damages in such cases, which is crucial for parties to understand when entering into the agreement.

2. **Exception for Third Party IP Infringement**: The clause specifically states that this limitation does not apply to claims or liabilities arising from the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if one party's actions lead to a claim of IP infringement by a third party, the other party can seek damages without being subject to the limitations outlined in the first part of the clause.

3. **Implications**: This exception is significant because it acknowledges the serious nature of intellectual property rights and the potential for substantial damages that can arise from infringement claims. By excluding these claims from the cap on liability, the parties are recognizing that such situations may warrant full accountability and potential damages beyond the usual limitations.

This is crucial for protecting the rights of third parties and ensuring that parties cannot escape liability for significant breaches related to IP infringement simply by relying on a liability cap.

4. **Overall Implications**: This clause serves to balance the interests of the parties by allowing for a cap on liability for most claims while ensuring that serious issues, such as IP infringement, are treated with the gravity they deserve.

1. **Exclusion of IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that liability arising from Section 9.3, which pertains to intellectual property infringement, is not subject to the limitations outlined in the clause. This means that if a party is found liable for infringing on a third party's intellectual property rights, they cannot rely on the liability cap to limit their damages. This aligns with your request for a liability cap clause that excludes third-party IP infringement.

2. **Limitation on Other Damages**: The clause limits liability for indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages, as well as for losses such as loss of use, profits, or goodwill. This is a common feature in liability cap clauses, which aim to protect parties from extensive financial exposure due to unforeseen or indirect consequences of a breach.

3. **Cap on Liability**: The clause also establishes a cap on liability, stating that neither party shall be liable for an amount greater than what they have earned under the revenue-sharing provisions in the preceding twelve months. This is a typical approach in contracts to provide a predictable limit on potential financial exposure.

4. **Exclusion of Other Serious Misconduct**: While the clause does not explicitly mention fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, it is common for liability cap clauses to exclude such serious forms of misconduct from limitations. If the contract includes other sections that address fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, those would typically be excluded from the liability cap as well.

In summary, this clause effectively addresses your query by excluding liability for third-party IP infringement from the limitations on liability, while also providing a framework for capping other types of liability.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause also limits the liability of the parties for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages.

3. **Exclusion of Certain Misconduct**: While the clause does not explicitly mention fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, it is common in legal agreements to have separate provisions that address these types of misconduct. Typically, liability caps do not apply to such egregious actions, as they are considered serious breaches of duty or trust. Therefore, while the clause does not directly state this exclusion, it is often implied in the context of liability limitations.

3. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause outlines a specific limitation of liability, capping the total aggregate liability to the amount of purchase prices paid by one party to the other in the twelve months preceding a claim.

4. **Overall Structure**: The structure of the clause demonstrates a clear intention to balance risk management through a liability cap while also ensuring that serious breaches, particularly those involving IP infringement and misconduct, are not shielded by that cap. This aligns with the legal principle that parties should be held accountable for significant breaches of contract or law.

This aligns with your request to exclude liability for willful misconduct, ensuring that if a party acts with intent to harm or in a grossly negligent manner, they cannot rely on the liability cap as a defense.

3. **General Liability Cap**: The clause outlines a general liability cap that limits the total aggregate liability of one party to another for claims related to breaches of the agreement. However, it makes clear that this cap does not apply in cases of unauthorized use of IP, willful misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. This structure is typical in contracts to balance risk while ensuring that serious breaches (like IP infringement and willful misconduct) are adequately addressed.

4. **Scope of Liability**: The clause also mentions that the liability cap applies to claims arising from breaches of the agreement or related agreements, which is a common practice in contracts to define the scope of liability clearly. However, the exclusions ensure that significant breaches are not shielded by the cap.

In summary, this clause effectively addresses your query by outlining specific exclusions from the liability cap for unauthorized use of intellectual property and willful misconduct, thereby ensuring that parties cannot evade responsibility for serious breaches.",5

ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.5 titled ""Limitation of Liability,"" is relevant to your query regarding liability cap clauses that exclude third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement and fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct for several reasons:

1. **Exclusions for Fraud and Breach of IP Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that there are exceptions to the limitation of liability in cases of fraud by a party or a breach of obligations under Article 7 (Intellectual Property) and Article 10 (Confidentiality). This means that if a party commits fraud or breaches its IP obligations, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to cap their exposure to damages. This aligns with your query's focus on excluding certain types of liability from caps.

2. **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**: The clause also mentions that liability is not capped to the extent that damages are required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification. This indicates that if a party is required to indemnify another party for third-party claims (which could include IP infringement claims), the limitation of liability does not apply. This is particularly relevant to your query about third-party IP infringement.

3. **General Limitation of Liability**: The clause outlines that, except for the specified exclusions, neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or other types of damages that are not foreseeable. This is a common feature in liability cap clauses, which aim to limit the scope of liability while still allowing for certain critical exceptions.

In summary, this clause effectively addresses your query by outlining specific exclusions from liability caps related to fraud, breaches of IP obligations, and third-party claims, thereby ensuring that parties remain accountable for significant misconduct and obligations, while still attempting to limit liability for other types of damages.",5

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum liability amount (referred to as the ""Liability Cap"") that one party can owe to the other in relation to the agreement. This is a common provision in contracts to limit potential financial exposure.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to certain situations:
   - **Material Breach of Confidentiality**: Section 5 addresses confidentiality breaches, indicating that if one party fails to uphold confidentiality obligations, they can be held liable beyond the cap.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: Section 7.1 refers to indemnification, which typically involves one party agreeing to compensate the other for certain damages or losses. This obligation is also exempt from the Liability Cap.
   - **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: The clause further states that if a party engages in intentional misconduct or gross negligence, they cannot rely on the Liability Cap to limit their liability.

3. **Relevance to Personal or Bodily Injury**: While the clause does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury, it is important to note that many jurisdictions do not allow liability caps to limit claims arising from personal injury or bodily harm. The exceptions outlined (material breaches, indemnification, intentional misconduct, and gross negligence) could potentially encompass situations involving personal injury, especially if the injury results from gross negligence or intentional actions.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations on liability while also specifying exceptions that could apply in cases of personal or bodily injury, particularly through the lens of gross negligence or intentional misconduct. If a personal injury claim arises from such actions, the Liability Cap would not apply, allowing for full recovery of damages.",5

9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause you provided outlines a ""Limitation of Liability"" section in a legal agreement, which is relevant to your query regarding a personal or bodily injury exception to a liability cap. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This means that, generally, the parties agree that their financial responsibility for claims arising from the agreement is capped at a certain amount.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly lists exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply. These exceptions include:
   - **Material confidentiality breaches** (Section 5)
   - **Indemnification obligations** (Section 7.1)
   - **Intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence** (Section 9.1.2)

3. **Relevance to Personal or Bodily Injury**: While the clause does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury, it is important to note that many legal agreements typically exclude personal injury claims from liability caps. This is because personal injury claims often involve serious consequences that cannot be adequately addressed by monetary limits. The inclusion of exceptions for intentional misconduct and gross negligence suggests that the parties recognize that certain types of harm, particularly those that could lead to personal or bodily injury, may warrant liability beyond the cap.

4. **Interpretation**: In practice, if a claim arises from personal or bodily injury, it is likely that a court would interpret the exceptions in this clause to allow for recovery beyond the Liability Cap, especially if the injury resulted from gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly state that personal or bodily injury claims are exempt from the liability cap, the exceptions provided imply that such claims could be treated differently, allowing for potential recovery beyond the established limit. This aligns with common legal principles that prioritize the protection of individuals from serious harm.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap,e156a5b7c4,"28.2. Limitations of Liability--Except in respect of personal injury or death caused by the negligence of either party (for which by law no limit applies), in the event either party shall be liable to the other party on account of the performance or nonperformance of its respective obligations under this Agreement, whether arising by negligence, wilful misconduct or otherwise, the amount recoverable by the other party for all events, acts or omissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to payments made under this Agreement.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 28.2, addresses limitations of liability between the parties involved in the agreement. It explicitly states that, except for cases of personal injury or death caused by negligence, there is a cap on the amount recoverable by one party from the other for any claims arising from the performance or nonperformance of obligations under the agreement. 

This is relevant to your query about the ""personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap"" because it highlights that the limitation of liability does not apply in cases of personal injury or death. In legal terms, this means that if one party's negligence results in personal injury or death, the injured party is not bound by the liability cap and can seek full compensation for damages without limitation. 

Thus, the clause serves to protect individuals from being limited in their recovery for serious injuries or fatalities, ensuring that they can pursue claims for damages that exceed the agreed-upon liability cap in the contract. This exception is important in legal agreements as it acknowledges the severity of personal injury claims and the need for full accountability in such cases.",5

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,"" establishes a limitation on the types of damages for which either party can be held liable under the agreement. Specifically, it states that neither party shall be liable for indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages related to the agreement. This limitation is a common feature in contracts, aiming to cap potential liabilities and protect parties from extensive financial exposure.

In the context of your query regarding a ""personal or bodily injury exception to liability cap,"" this clause is relevant because it outlines the general framework for liability limitations. If the agreement includes a cap on liability, it is essential to consider whether personal or bodily injury claims are excluded from this cap. 

Typically, liability caps do not apply to personal or bodily injury claims, as these types of damages are often considered fundamental and serious. Therefore, if the agreement intends to limit liability for indirect or consequential damages but does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury claims, it may imply that such claims are exempt from the liability cap. 

In summary, while the clause limits liability for certain types of damages, it raises the question of whether personal or bodily injury claims are included in that limitation. If they are not explicitly excluded, it could mean that parties retain the right to seek full compensation for personal or bodily injury damages, regardless of the liability cap established in the agreement.",4

In the context of your query regarding a personal or bodily injury exception to the liability cap, this clause is relevant because it establishes a general framework for liability limitations. However, it does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury as an exception to the liability cap. 

Typically, liability caps in contracts often exclude personal or bodily injury claims, as these types of claims are considered more serious and may not be appropriate to limit in the same way as economic damages. If the agreement were to include a personal or bodily injury exception, it would need to be explicitly stated in the liability limitation clause.

In summary, while the clause sets forth limitations on liability, it does not address personal or bodily injury claims, which may require a separate provision or an explicit exception to the liability cap to ensure that such claims are not subject to the same limitations as other types of damages.",3

1. **Liability Cap Definition**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This cap is intended to limit the financial exposure of the parties in relation to the agreement.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to certain situations, which are critical for understanding confidentiality exceptions:
   - **Material Confidentiality Breach**: Section 9.1.1(1) specifies that any material breach of confidentiality under Section 5 is an exception to the Liability Cap. This means that if one party breaches the confidentiality obligations outlined in Section 5, they can be held liable beyond the established cap for any damages resulting from that breach.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also notes that indemnification obligations under Section 7.1 are exempt from the Liability Cap. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for losses related to confidentiality breaches or other issues, they can be liable for the full amount of those losses, regardless of the cap.

3. **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: Additionally, Section 9.1.2 states that the Liability Cap does not apply to cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This further emphasizes that serious breaches of duty, including those related to confidentiality, can lead to liability beyond the cap.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it clearly outlines the exceptions to the liability cap concerning confidentiality breaches, ensuring that parties can seek full remedies for significant violations of confidentiality obligations without being limited by the cap.",5

1. **Confidentiality Breach**: The clause states that the liability cap will not apply to any material confidentiality breach under Section 5.

This is a significant exception, as it underscores the importance of maintaining confidentiality and allows the non-breaching party to seek full compensation for damages resulting from such a breach.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: Additionally, the clause specifies that the liability cap does not apply to indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.

Here's how it is relevant to the query regarding confidentiality exceptions to the liability cap:

1. **Exceptions to Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the limitations of liability do not apply in cases of either party's violation of confidentiality obligations. This means that if one party breaches the confidentiality provisions of the agreement, they can be held liable for damages that exceed the cap established in the agreement (which is the amount of fees paid or payable under the agreement).

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: Similarly, the clause also notes that indemnification obligations are exempt from the liability cap.

4. **Implications for Enforcement**: The references to irreparable damage and the right to seek equitable relief (such as injunctions) in the external information provided further emphasize the importance of confidentiality. If a party breaches confidentiality, the other party may seek remedies that are not limited by the liability cap, reinforcing the critical nature of confidentiality in the agreement.

However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for certain types of conduct, including:
   - **Fraud**: If a party commits fraud, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages.
   - **Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct**: Similar to fraud, if a party engages in gross negligence or willful misconduct, they are also excluded from the liability cap.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**: This section sets a cap on the aggregate liability of a party under the agreement. However, it also includes exceptions that mirror those in Section 11.6:
   - The liability cap does not apply to claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.
   - Additionally, it specifies that the limitation does not apply to breaches of confidentiality or indemnification obligations.

ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.5 titled ""Limitation of Liability,"" is directly relevant to the query regarding a party's liability for fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort subject to a cap. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Exclusions from Limitation**: The clause explicitly states exceptions to the limitation of liability. It notes that a party is not protected from liability in cases of:
   - **Fraud**: If a party commits fraud, they cannot limit their liability.
   - **Breach of Obligations**: Specifically, breaches related to intellectual property (Article 7) or confidentiality (Article 10) are also excluded from the limitation.

2. **Scope of Liability**: The clause limits liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, remote, exemplary, or speculative damages. This means that while parties may be liable for direct damages, they are not liable for these types of damages unless they fall under the exceptions mentioned.

3. **Negligence and Tort**: The clause includes language that limits liability for claims arising from tort, negligence, or breach of statutory duty. This indicates that, generally, a party would not be liable for these claims unless they fall under the exceptions.

4. **Indemnification**: The clause also mentions that if damages are required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification, those damages are not subject to the limitation. This means that if a party has to indemnify another for certain claims, they can be held liable beyond the limitations set forth in this clause.

In summary, this clause establishes a framework for liability that caps certain types of damages while providing exceptions for serious breaches such as fraud and specific obligations. It is crucial for understanding the extent to which parties can be held liable in various scenarios, including fraud, negligence, and tort claims.",5

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that, except for specific sections (13(a) and 13(b)), neither party will be liable for special, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that if one party suffers damages due to the other party's actions (including fraud or negligence), they cannot claim certain types of damages that might otherwise be available under law.

2. **Cap on Liability**: The clause further specifies that the liability of either party for damages is limited to a specific amount, which is defined as ""the amounts to be paid by CLIENT to EXCITE hereunder."" This establishes a cap on the potential financial exposure of each party, regardless of the nature of the claim (contract, tort, etc.). 

3. **Scope of Liability**: By including language that limits liability for damages arising from torts (including negligence), the clause effectively caps the liability for personal injury or tort claims as well. This is significant because it provides a clear boundary on what each party can expect in terms of financial responsibility, which is particularly important in contractual relationships where risks need to be managed.

4. **Exclusions**: The clause also indicates that there are exceptions (Sections 13(a) and 13(b)), which may pertain to specific types of liability that are not capped. This is important for understanding the full scope of liability and what situations might fall outside the limitation.

In summary, this clause serves to limit the liability of the parties involved in the contract, specifically addressing potential claims related to fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort, and establishes a cap on the damages that can be claimed, thereby providing a measure of protection for both parties.",5

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly establishes a ""Liability Cap,"" which sets a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other in relation to the agreement. This is directly related to the query as it addresses how liability is capped, which is a common practice in contracts to manage risk.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply. Notably, it states that the cap does not apply to:
   - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).
   - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).
   - Intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.

   This is significant because it indicates that while there is a cap on liability for general claims, certain serious breaches (like fraud or gross negligence) are not subject to this cap, allowing for potentially unlimited liability in those cases.

3. **Definition of Liability**: The clause defines ""liability"" broadly to include claims arising from various legal theories, including tort (which encompasses negligence and personal injury). This means that the cap applies to a wide range of potential claims, but with the noted exceptions.

4. **Legal Framework**: The clause provides a framework for understanding how liability is managed within the context of the agreement, which is crucial for parties to know their potential exposure and the limits of their obligations.

In summary, this clause directly addresses the query by establishing a cap on liability while also specifying important exceptions that ensure accountability for serious breaches, such as fraud and gross negligence.

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages. This indicates that there is a cap on the types of damages that can be claimed, which is a common practice in contracts to limit exposure to potentially unlimited liability.

2. **Exclusions**: The clause makes exceptions for breaches of confidentiality and does not limit indemnification obligations. This means that while there is a cap on liability for most claims, certain serious breaches (like confidentiality) and indemnification claims are not subject to this limitation. This is important in the context of fraud or negligence, as it suggests that if a party commits fraud or a serious breach, they may still be held fully liable.

3. **Applicability to Various Claims**: The clause mentions that the limitation applies regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, product liability, or otherwise. This broad language indicates that the limitation of liability applies to claims arising from negligence or torts, which are often the basis for personal injury claims.

4. **Legal Compliance**: The clause also notes that the limitation of liability does not apply if it is contrary to applicable law. This is significant because it acknowledges that certain jurisdictions may not allow limitations on liability for specific types of claims, such as fraud or personal injury, thereby ensuring that the clause is enforceable within the bounds of the law.

In summary, this clause serves to cap the liability of the parties in the event of claims related to fraud, negligence, personal injury, or tort, while also outlining exceptions and ensuring compliance with applicable laws.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly establishes a ""Liability Cap,"" which sets a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other in relation to the agreement. This directly addresses the query about capping liability, as it defines the extent to which one party can be held financially responsible for claims arising from the agreement.

2. **Exclusions from the Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the Liability Cap does not apply. Notably, it states that the cap does not apply to:
   - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).
   - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).
   - Intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.

   This is significant because it indicates that while there is a cap on liability for general claims, certain serious breaches (like fraud or gross negligence) are not limited by this cap. This aligns with the query's focus on liability for fraud and negligence, indicating that such liabilities can exceed the established cap.

3. **Definition of Liability**: The clause provides a broad definition of ""liability,"" which includes claims arising from tort (including negligence), among other categories. This is pertinent to the query as it confirms that the cap applies to various forms of liability, including those arising from negligence or tortious actions.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: By including various forms of liability (contract, tort, equity, statute), the clause ensures that the parties are aware of the scope of potential liabilities and the limitations imposed by the Liability Cap.

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum liability (the ""Liability Cap"") that one party can owe to the other under the agreement. This is a common provision in contracts to limit exposure to damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to certain situations, including:
   - **Material confidentiality breaches** under Section 5.
   - **Indemnification obligations** under Section 7.1.

3. **Indemnification Carveout**: The reference to indemnification obligations indicates that if one party is required to indemnify the other (for example, for claims arising from breaches of the agreement or other specified liabilities), those indemnification claims are not subject to the Liability Cap. This is significant because it allows for full recovery of damages related to indemnification, which could include personal or bodily injury claims.

4. **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: The clause also states that the Liability Cap does not apply to claims arising from intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This is relevant because personal or bodily injury claims often arise from such conduct, and the exclusion ensures that parties can seek full recovery for serious wrongdoings.

5. **Definition of Liability**: The clause defines ""liability"" broadly to include claims arising from tort (including negligence), which encompasses personal injury claims. This broad definition supports the idea that personal injury claims can be pursued outside the confines of the Liability Cap.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations on liability while also providing specific exceptions, including indemnification obligations, which can encompass personal or bodily injury claims.

However, it explicitly carves out an exception for obligations related to indemnification in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses, the limitation on liability for consequential damages does not apply. This is significant because it suggests that indemnification obligations can extend beyond the typical limitations on liability, potentially including personal or bodily injury claims.

However, it does not specify whether personal or bodily injury claims are included in this cap. The language used in this section indicates that the limitation applies broadly, but the carveout in Section 12.3 for indemnification suggests that if the indemnification relates to personal or bodily injury, it may not be subject to the same cap.

In summary, the relevance of this clause to your query lies in the interplay between the limitation on liability and the indemnification obligations. The carveout for indemnifiable losses in Section 12.3 implies that personal or bodily injury claims could be exempt from the liability cap, allowing for full recovery of damages related to such claims, even if they would typically fall under the general limitation on liability. This creates a potential exception to the cap on liability for personal or bodily injury through the indemnification provisions.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout,980a304336,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits. This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided contains two key sections that are relevant to your query regarding a personal or bodily injury exception to a cap on liability via an indemnification carveout.

1. **Section 12.3 - No Liability for Consequential Damages**: This section states that no party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. However, it explicitly carves out an exception for obligations related to indemnification in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses, the limitation on liability for consequential damages does not apply. This is significant because it suggests that if the indemnification relates to personal or bodily injury, the cap on liability may not apply, allowing for greater recovery in such cases.

2. **Section 12.4 - Limitation on Liability**: This section establishes a cap on each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any causes of action, including those arising from contract or tort. However, it does not specify that this cap applies to indemnification obligations. Since Section 12.3 indicates that indemnification obligations are not subject to the limitation on consequential damages, it can be inferred that the cap on liability in Section 12.4 may also not apply to indemnification claims, particularly those related to personal or bodily injury.

In summary, the clauses suggest that while there is a general cap on liability and a limitation on consequential damages, obligations to indemnify for certain losses (potentially including personal or bodily injury) are exceptions to these limitations. This aligns with the concept of an indemnification carveout, which allows for recovery beyond the standard liability limits in specific circumstances, such as personal injury claims.",5

9 Limitation of Liability.
9.1 The maximum liability of one Party to the other Party and its affiliates in relation to this Agreement will be [***] (""Liability Cap""), provided however that:
9.1.1 The Liability Cap will not apply to any (1) material confidentiality breach under Section 5, and/or (2) indemnification obligations under Section 7.1.
9.1.2 The Liability Cap will not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.
9.2 For the purpose of this Section, ""liability"" means liability for any and all claims, causes of action, judgments, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees and expenses), reimbursements, losses, and any and all other liabilities and damages of any kind, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), equity, statute or otherwise arising out of, in relation to or as a result of this Agreement.","The clause you provided, particularly Section 9 on Limitation of Liability, is relevant to your query regarding the personal or bodily injury exception to the cap on liability via indemnification carveout for several reasons:

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum liability (the ""Liability Cap"") that one party can owe to the other under the agreement. This is a common provision in contracts to limit exposure to damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to certain situations, including:
   - **Material confidentiality breaches** under Section 5.
   - **Indemnification obligations** under Section 7.1.

3. **Indemnification Carveout**: The reference to indemnification obligations indicates that any claims arising from indemnification (which often includes personal injury or bodily injury claims) are not subject to the Liability Cap. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for personal or bodily injury claims, those claims can exceed the established Liability Cap.

4. **Intentional Misconduct and Gross Negligence**: The clause also states that the Liability Cap does not apply to claims arising from intentional misconduct or gross negligence. This is significant because personal or bodily injury claims could potentially fall under these categories, further reinforcing that such claims are not limited by the Liability Cap.

5. **Broad Definition of Liability**: The definition of ""liability"" in the clause encompasses a wide range of claims, including those arising from tort (which includes personal injury). This broad definition supports the notion that personal injury claims are included in the types of liabilities that can exceed the Liability Cap.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations on liability while also providing specific exceptions, including indemnification obligations, which can encompass personal or bodily injury claims. This ensures that parties are not limited in their ability to seek full recovery for such serious claims, regardless of the overall cap on liability established in the agreement.",5

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel. Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause provided, specifically Section 14.4 on Indemnification, is relevant to the query regarding a personal or bodily injury exception to a cap on liability via an indemnification carveout for several reasons:

1. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause outlines the indemnification obligations of one party (the indemnitor) to another (the indemnitee) for a wide range of losses and expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the Franchised Business. This includes claims arising from the maintenance and operation of vehicles, which could encompass personal or bodily injury claims.

2. **Exclusion of Gross Negligence**: The clause specifies that indemnification does not apply to liabilities arising from the gross negligence of the indemnitees. This is significant because it creates a carveout that could allow for liability in cases of personal or bodily injury resulting from gross negligence, thereby potentially circumventing a cap on liability that might otherwise apply.

3. **Comprehensive Definition of Losses and Expenses**: The definition of ""losses and expenses"" includes compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages, which could arise from personal injury claims. This broad definition suggests that the indemnitor is responsible for a wide array of potential liabilities, including those related to personal injury, unless specifically excluded.

4. **Defense Obligations**: The clause also imposes a duty on the indemnitor to defend the indemnitees against claims, which is particularly relevant in the context of personal injury claims. This defense obligation reinforces the indemnification framework and highlights the indemnitor's responsibility to cover legal costs associated with such claims.

5. **Prompt Notice Requirement**: The requirement for the indemnitor to provide prompt notice of any event requiring indemnification emphasizes the proactive nature of the indemnification process, which is crucial in personal injury cases where timely responses can significantly impact the outcome.

In summary, this indemnification clause establishes a framework that could allow for exceptions to liability caps in cases of personal or bodily injury, particularly through the carveout for gross negligence and the broad definition of indemnifiable losses. It underscores the importance of indemnification in managing risks associated with personal injury claims in the context of the franchised business operations.",5

EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM SECTION 9.3 [Intellectual Property Infringement], IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.
EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING FROM SECTION 9.3 [Intellectual Property Infringement], IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR AN AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT THAT SUCH PARTY HAS EARNED PURSUANT TO THE REVENUE SHARING PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5.4 [Share of Net Revenue] IN THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE CLAIM","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.4, outlines limitations on liability for the parties involved in the agreement. It establishes that, with the exception of liabilities arising from Section 9.3 (which pertains to Intellectual Property Infringement), neither party can be held liable for indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages. Additionally, it caps the liability of each party to the amount they have earned under the revenue-sharing provisions in the preceding twelve months.

This clause is relevant to your query regarding a ""third party IP infringement exception to cap on liability via indemnification carveout"" for several reasons:

1. **Exclusion of IP Infringement from Liability Cap**: The clause explicitly states that liabilities arising from Section 9.3 (Intellectual Property Infringement) are exceptions to the general limitations on liability. This means that if a party is found liable for infringing on a third party's intellectual property rights, that liability is not subject to the cap outlined in the clause. This aligns with the concept of an indemnification carveout, where certain liabilities (in this case, IP infringement) are excluded from the limitations on liability.

2. **Indemnification Implications**: While the clause does not explicitly mention indemnification, the reference to IP infringement suggests that there may be an obligation for one party to indemnify the other in the event of a claim related to IP infringement. This is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from losses incurred due to third-party claims, particularly in the context of intellectual property.

3. **Protection Against Third-Party Claims**: By allowing for liability related to IP infringement to fall outside the general limitations, the clause provides a safeguard for parties against potential claims from third parties. This is particularly important in industries where intellectual property is a significant asset, as it ensures that parties can seek full recourse for damages resulting from such claims.

In summary, Section 9.4 is relevant to your query as it establishes a clear exception to the liability cap for claims related to intellectual property infringement, which aligns with the concept of an indemnification carveout for third-party IP infringement. This ensures that parties are adequately protected against significant risks associated with IP rights.",5

Here's how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a general limitation on liability for both parties, stating that neither party shall be liable for incidental, consequential, indirect, special, or punitive damages. This sets a baseline for liability, which is important when considering exceptions.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply to breaches of confidentiality, indemnification obligations, or infringement of intellectual property rights. This is crucial because it indicates that if a party is found to infringe on a third party's intellectual property rights, the usual cap on liability does not apply. This means that the party responsible for the infringement may be liable for damages beyond the standard limits set forth in the agreement.

3. **Third-Party IP Infringement**: The mention of ""infringement of intellectual property rights"" directly addresses your query about third-party IP infringement. If one party's actions lead to a claim of IP infringement by a third party, the indemnification obligations would kick in, allowing the injured party to seek remedies that exceed the typical liability cap.

4. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause effectively serves as an indemnification carveout, meaning that in cases of IP infringement, the party responsible for the infringement must indemnify the other party, and this obligation is not limited by the liability cap. This ensures that the injured party can recover full damages related to the infringement, which is a critical protection in contracts involving intellectual property.

In summary, this clause provides a clear framework for how liability is limited in general but carves out exceptions for indemnification related to IP infringement, thereby ensuring that parties are held accountable for such serious breaches without the constraints of the usual liability limits.",5

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a general limitation on liability for both parties, stating that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages arising from the agreement. This sets a baseline for liability that is typically capped, which is a common practice in contracts to limit exposure to unforeseen damages.

2. **Indemnification Carveouts**: The clause explicitly mentions exceptions to this limitation of liability. It states that the limitation does not apply in cases of breaches related to Article 7 (which likely pertains to confidentiality or similar obligations) and specific sections related to representations and warranties, as well as indemnification obligations. This indicates that if a party breaches these specific obligations, they may be liable for damages that exceed the typical limitations set forth in the clause.

3. **Third-Party IP Infringement**: While the clause does not explicitly mention third-party IP infringement, the reference to indemnification obligations suggests that if one party is required to indemnify the other for claims related to third-party IP infringement, this could fall under the exceptions to the limitation of liability. For instance, if a third party claims that a product or service provided under the agreement infringes their IP rights, the indemnifying party may be liable for damages resulting from that infringement, which would not be subject to the general cap on liability.

4. **Indemnification Sections**: The clause references specific indemnification sections (9.4(i)(d) and 9.5(i)(d)). If these sections include provisions for indemnifying against third-party claims, including IP infringement claims, then the liability for such claims would not be limited by the general cap outlined in Section 9.3. This creates a carveout for liability related to third-party IP infringement, allowing the injured party to seek full recovery for damages incurred as a result of such claims.

In summary, while the clause itself does not directly address third-party IP infringement, it establishes a framework where indemnification obligations can create exceptions to the limitation of liability, potentially allowing for full recovery in cases of third-party IP infringement claims.",5

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a general limitation on liability for both parties, stating that neither party shall be liable for special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages. This limitation is a common feature in contracts to protect parties from extensive liability.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not limit a party's indemnification obligations. This is crucial because indemnification typically involves one party agreeing to compensate the other for certain losses or damages, including those arising from third-party claims. In the context of IP infringement, if one party's actions lead to a third-party claim of IP infringement, the indemnifying party may be required to cover the costs associated with that claim, regardless of the general limitation on liability.

3. **Third Party Claims**: The clause mentions that the limitation of liability does not apply to damages awarded to a third party under a third-party claim. This is particularly relevant to your query about IP infringement, as such claims often arise from allegations that one party's products or services infringe on the intellectual property rights of another party. If a third party successfully claims damages for IP infringement, the indemnifying party may be liable for those damages, thus creating an exception to the general cap on liability.

4. **Carveout for IP Infringement**: While the clause does not explicitly mention IP infringement, the reference to third-party claims implies that if a third party asserts an IP infringement claim against one of the parties, the indemnification obligations would apply, and the limitation of liability would not cap the indemnifying party's responsibility for those specific claims.

In summary, Section 13.4 establishes a framework where the general limitation of liability is overridden in the case of indemnification obligations, particularly in the context of third-party claims, which can include IP infringement. This aligns with your query about creating an exception to the cap on liability for third-party IP infringement through an indemnification carveout.",5

1. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause explicitly states that there are exceptions to the liability cap, particularly in relation to breaches associated with the unauthorized use of intellectual property. This indicates that if one party infringes on a third party's IP rights, this would not be subject to the liability cap, allowing for greater potential liability in such cases.

2. **Liability Cap**: The clause outlines a general liability cap that limits the total aggregate liability of one party to another for claims related to breaches of the agreement. However, it carves out specific exceptions, including those related to unauthorized use of intellectual property. This means that if a party is found liable for IP infringement, they could be liable for damages beyond the capped amount.

3. **Protection Against Third-Party Claims**: By including a specific reference to unauthorized use of intellectual property, the clause provides a mechanism for addressing third-party claims. If a third party alleges that one party has infringed on their IP rights, the affected party can seek indemnification from the party responsible for the infringement, thus protecting themselves from potential damages.

4. **Alignment with Legal Principles**: The clause aligns with common legal principles that allow for indemnification in cases of IP infringement. It recognizes that damages resulting from such breaches can be significant and may not be adequately addressed by a liability cap, thus justifying the need for an exception.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it establishes a clear exception to the liability cap for claims related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, thereby allowing for indemnification in cases of third-party IP infringement. This ensures that parties are held accountable for IP-related breaches without being limited by the general liability cap.",5

### Key Points of Relevance:

1. **Exclusions from Liability Caps**:
   - The clause explicitly states that certain types of conduct are exceptions to the limitations on liability. Specifically, it mentions that liability limitations do not apply in cases of:
     - A party's fraud
     - A party's gross negligence
     - A party's willful misconduct
   - This means that if a party engages in any of these behaviors, they cannot rely on the liability cap to limit their financial responsibility.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**:
   - The clause also outlines indemnification obligations under Article 12, which are another exception to the liability cap. This means that if a party is required to indemnify another party for losses arising from claims related to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the liability cap does not apply.
   - The indemnification provisions (Sections 12.1 and 12.2) specify that each party will indemnify the other for claims arising from breaches of the agreement or misconduct, which reinforces the idea that parties cannot escape liability for serious wrongdoing.

3. **Legal and Equitable Remedies**:
   - The references to the right to seek injunctions and specific performance in the context of irreparable harm (as seen in the external information) further support the notion that parties can pursue remedies beyond monetary damages in cases of serious misconduct.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the clause you provided establishes that fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct are significant exceptions to the limitations on liability. This means that if such conduct occurs, the affected party can seek full recovery of damages without being constrained by the agreed-upon liability cap. Additionally, the indemnification provisions ensure that parties are held accountable for their actions, particularly in cases of misconduct, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the contractual relationship.",5

### Key Points of Relevance:

1. **Exclusions from Liability Caps**:
   - The clause explicitly states that certain types of conduct are exceptions to the limitations on liability. Specifically, it mentions that liability caps do not apply in cases of:
     - A party's fraud
     - A party's gross negligence
     - A party's willful misconduct
   - This means that if a party engages in any of these behaviors, they cannot rely on the liability cap to limit their financial responsibility.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**:
   - The clause also highlights that indemnification obligations under Article 12 are not subject to the liability cap. This means that if a party is required to indemnify another party for losses arising from claims related to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they must fulfill those obligations regardless of the liability cap.
   - The indemnification provisions (Sections 12.1 and 12.2) further clarify that both parties (BLI and Ginkgo) are responsible for indemnifying each other against claims arising from their respective breaches, negligence, or misconduct. This reinforces the idea that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct through the cap on liability.

3. **Legal and Equitable Remedies**:
   - The external information provided indicates that parties may seek equitable remedies (like injunctions) in the event of breaches, particularly when monetary damages are insufficient. This aligns with the idea that serious misconduct (fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct) can lead to remedies beyond mere financial compensation.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the clause establishes that fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct are significant exceptions to the limitations on liability, ensuring that parties cannot evade responsibility for serious wrongdoing. Additionally, the indemnification provisions ensure that parties are held accountable for losses arising from such conduct, reinforcing the importance of these exceptions in the context of the overall agreement.",5

### Breakdown of the Clause:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**:
   - This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, such as lost profits or indirect damages, arising from the agreement. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions to this limitation:
     - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: If a party engages in any of these actions, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages resulting from such conduct.
     - **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also states that any claims related to a party's indemnification obligations under Article 12 are exempt from the limitation on liability.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**:
   - This section sets a cap on the aggregate liability of a party under the agreement. However, it also includes exceptions:
     - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: Similar to Section 11.6, this section confirms that the liability cap does not apply if the claim arises from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.
     - **Indemnification Obligations**: Again, claims related to indemnification obligations are excluded from the liability cap.

### Relevance to the Query:
- The clause directly addresses the query by outlining how liability limitations are affected by specific types of misconduct (fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct) and by indemnification obligations. 
- It clarifies that in cases of serious wrongdoing or when indemnification is involved, the parties cannot limit their liability, thus ensuring that victims of such actions can seek full recovery without being constrained by the agreed-upon limits in the contract.
- This is crucial for parties entering into the agreement, as it provides a clear understanding of the circumstances under which they can be held fully liable, regardless of the limitations typically imposed by the contract. 

In summary, the clause serves to protect parties from being shielded by liability caps in cases of serious misconduct or when indemnification is at stake, aligning with the query's focus on exceptions to liability limitations.",5

### Breakdown of the Clause:

1. **Liability Cap**: The clause establishes a maximum limit on the liability of one party to the other, referred to as the ""Liability Cap."" This is a common provision in contracts to limit potential financial exposure.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**:
   - **Section 9.1.1**: The Liability Cap does not apply to:
     - Material breaches of confidentiality (Section 5).
     - Indemnification obligations (Section 7.1).
   - **Section 9.1.2**: The Liability Cap also does not apply to intentional misconduct and/or gross negligence.

### Relevance to the Query:

- **Indemnification Carveout**: The mention of indemnification obligations in Section 9.1.1 indicates that any claims arising from indemnification (which often includes claims related to fraud or misconduct) are not subject to the Liability Cap. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other due to certain breaches or claims, the indemnifying party cannot limit its liability to the cap.

- **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: Section 9.1.2 explicitly states that the Liability Cap does not apply to intentional misconduct and gross negligence. This means that if a party engages in fraudulent behavior or acts with gross negligence, they cannot rely on the Liability Cap to limit their liability for damages resulting from such actions.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the clause effectively carves out exceptions to the Liability Cap for indemnification obligations and for claims arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious breaches or wrongful acts by invoking the cap, thereby providing a level of protection to the non-breaching party. This aligns with the principles of fairness and accountability in contractual relationships.",5

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses.

If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause provided, specifically Section 14.4 on Indemnification, is relevant to your query regarding the exception to the cap on liability through an indemnification carveout for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause establishes an obligation for one party (the indemnitor) to indemnify and hold harmless the other party (the indemnitees) from losses and expenses arising from claims related to the operation of the Franchised Business. This includes a broad range of potential liabilities, which is a key aspect of indemnification.

2. **Exclusion for Gross Negligence**: Importantly, the clause explicitly states that the indemnity does not apply to liabilities arising from the gross negligence of the indemnitees. This creates a carveout that limits the indemnification obligation in cases where the indemnitees are grossly negligent. This is significant because it indicates that while the indemnitor is generally responsible for indemnifying the indemnitees, they are not responsible for indemnifying them in cases of gross negligence.

3. **Implications for Liability Caps**: In many contracts, liability caps are established to limit the financial exposure of one party to another. However, exceptions to these caps are often included for certain types of misconduct, such as fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. The carveout in this indemnification clause suggests that if the indemnitees engage in gross negligence, they cannot seek indemnification for those specific liabilities, which effectively means that the cap on liability may not apply in those circumstances.

4. **Broader Context of Liability**: The clause also outlines what constitutes ""losses and expenses,"" which includes a wide range of damages and costs. This broad definition reinforces the importance of the indemnification provision and its exceptions, as it highlights the potential financial implications of various claims.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the conditions under which indemnification is provided, specifies the exceptions (such as gross negligence), and indicates how these exceptions may interact with any caps on liability. This is crucial for understanding the overall risk allocation between the parties in the contract.",5

Liability Cap,"" is relevant to the query regarding seller-favorable caps on liability clauses because it establishes a limitation on the total aggregate liability of one party (in this case, the Distributor) to another party (the Seller, Accuray) for claims arising from breaches of the agreement.

Here are the key points that illustrate its relevance:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly caps the liability of the Distributor to the amount of purchase prices paid to Accuray for products over the preceding twelve months. This is a seller-favorable provision because it limits the potential financial exposure of the Seller (Accuray) in the event of a claim, which is advantageous for the Seller.

2. **Exclusions from Liability Cap**: The clause outlines specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, such as breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional breaches, willful misconduct, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. This means that while the liability is capped in most scenarios, the Seller retains the right to pursue full damages in cases of serious misconduct or legal violations, which can be seen as a balanced approach.

3. **Predictability and Risk Management**: By capping liability, the clause provides predictability for the Seller regarding potential financial risks associated with the agreement. This is particularly important in commercial contracts, as it allows the Seller to manage its risk exposure effectively.

4. **Seller-Favorable Terms**: Overall, the structure of this liability cap is designed to protect the Seller's interests by limiting the Distributor's liability while still allowing for recourse in cases of significant breaches. This aligns with the query's focus on seller-favorable terms in liability clauses.

In summary, the ""11.3. Liability Cap"" clause exemplifies a seller-favorable approach to liability by limiting the financial exposure of the Seller while maintaining certain rights to pursue claims in cases of serious breaches.",5

Here’s how it relates to the query regarding seller-favorable caps on liability:

1. **Cap on Liability**: The clause establishes a specific monetary cap on the liability of both the buyer and the seller, set at USD 13 million. This cap limits the potential financial exposure for the seller in the event of a breach of the agreement, which is a common seller-favorable provision.

2. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause specifies exceptions to the cap, stating that it does not apply to claims arising from bad faith, intentional or willful misconduct, or third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. This is important because it protects the seller from liability in cases of serious misconduct, while still providing a clear limit on liability for other types of claims.

3. **Balanced Risk**: By capping liability, the seller can better manage risk and avoid potentially devastating financial consequences from breaches that may occur. This is particularly advantageous in negotiations, as it provides a level of certainty regarding potential liabilities.

4. **Negotiation Leverage**: Including such a clause can serve as a negotiation tool, allowing the seller to present a more attractive offer to potential buyers by limiting their own exposure while still addressing the buyer's concerns about liability.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable cap on liability, providing a clear limit on the seller's financial exposure while excluding certain serious claims from that limitation.

Here's how it relates to the query regarding seller-favorable caps on liability clauses:

1. **Waiver of Certain Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the parties waive claims for punitive, exemplary, or statutory damages. This is beneficial for the seller as it limits their exposure to potentially large and unpredictable damages that could arise from a breach of contract.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect and Consequential Damages**: The clause further specifies that the seller will not be liable for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that if the buyer suffers losses that are not directly caused by the seller's actions (such as lost profits or damage to business reputation), the seller cannot be held responsible. This significantly reduces the seller's risk.

3. **Cap on Liability**: The clause caps the seller's total liability to the purchase price actually paid by the buyer for the products, or the value of any defective portion, whichever is lesser. This is a clear limitation on the seller's financial exposure, ensuring that they will not be liable for more than the amount the buyer has already paid. This cap is a common feature in seller-favorable contracts, as it provides a predictable maximum liability.

4. **Protection Against Failure of Remedy**: The clause also mentions that even if the exclusive remedy fails to achieve its essential purpose, the seller's liability is still capped at the purchase price. This further protects the seller from extensive liability, even in cases where the buyer may argue that the agreed-upon remedies are insufficient.

In summary, this Limitation of Liability clause is highly relevant to the query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable approach to liability, limiting the seller's exposure to various types of damages and capping their total liability to a predetermined amount. This is a common strategy in contracts to protect sellers from excessive financial risk.",5

Here’s how the clause aligns with the concept of a seller-favorable cap on liability:

1. **Defined Liability Cap**: The clause sets a clear monetary limit (AUD 50,000) on the aggregate liability of both Fiserv and the Merchant for losses arising from any cause related to the agreement. This cap is beneficial for the seller (in this case, Fiserv) as it limits their potential financial responsibility.

2. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause specifies that the liability cap does not apply to certain obligations, such as Fiserv’s obligation to remit transaction proceeds or the Merchant’s payment obligations. This exclusion allows the seller to retain some level of protection while still ensuring that critical financial obligations are met, which can be seen as a balanced approach.

3. **Risk Mitigation**: By capping liability, the seller can better manage risk and predict potential losses, which is particularly important in business transactions where unforeseen circumstances can lead to significant financial repercussions.

4. **Negotiation Leverage**: Such clauses are often negotiated in favor of the seller, allowing them to limit their exposure while still providing essential services or products to the buyer (the Merchant). This can be a point of negotiation in contract discussions, where sellers seek to ensure that their liability is manageable.

1. **Cap on Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the seller's maximum liability for all claims is limited to the invoice price of the product(s) involved. This is a clear example of a seller-favorable cap on liability, as it restricts the seller's financial exposure to a predetermined amount, which is typically much lower than potential damages that could arise from a breach or other claims.

2. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause further specifies that neither party will be liable for various types of damages, including special, incidental, punitive, consequential, indirect, or exemplary damages. This broad exclusion protects the seller from a wide range of potential claims that could arise from the transaction, thereby favoring the seller's position.

3. **Exclusive Remedies**: The clause states that the remedies set forth are exclusive, meaning that the buyer cannot seek any other remedies outside of what is specified in the agreement. This limits the buyer's options for recourse in the event of a dispute, further solidifying the seller's favorable position.

4. **Legal and Equitable Remedies**: By stating that the remedies are exclusive and adequate, the clause minimizes the buyer's ability to pursue additional legal or equitable remedies, such as specific performance or injunctions, which could otherwise impose greater liabilities on the seller.

Here’s how it relates to the concept of a buyer-favorable cap on liability:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a cap on the total aggregate liability of one party to another, which is a common feature in contracts to protect parties from excessive financial exposure. In this case, the liability is capped at the amount of purchase prices paid by the Distributor to Accuray for products over the preceding twelve months.

2. **Exclusions from Liability Cap**: The clause specifies certain exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, such as breaches related to unauthorized use of intellectual property, intentional breaches, or non-compliance with mandatory laws. While these exceptions are standard in many agreements to ensure accountability for serious breaches, they also indicate that the cap is designed to protect the buyer from routine claims while still holding the seller accountable for significant misconduct.

3. **Time Frame for Liability**: The limitation is based on a specific time frame (the twelve months preceding the claim notification), which is a common practice in liability caps. This aspect can be seen as favorable to the buyer, as it restricts the liability to a manageable period and amount, reducing the risk of long-term financial exposure.

In summary, this clause exemplifies a buyer-favorable cap on liability by limiting the financial exposure of the buyer (Distributor) to a defined amount based on recent transactions, while still allowing for accountability in cases of serious breaches.

1. **Buyer-Favorable Aspect**: In this clause, the liability cap is set at AUD 50,000. This can be seen as buyer-favorable if the buyer (in this case, the Merchant) is able to limit their potential losses to a defined amount, which can provide financial predictability and security. However, the clause also specifies exceptions where the liability cap does not apply, which could be seen as less favorable to the buyer.

2. **Exceptions to the Liability Cap**: The clause outlines two specific exceptions where the liability cap does not apply:
   - Fiserv’s obligation to remit proceeds from transactions processed under the agreement.
   - The Merchant’s payment obligations related to services and regulatory fees due to failure to perform obligations.

   These exceptions indicate that while the Merchant has a cap on liability for general losses, they still have significant financial responsibilities that could exceed the cap, particularly in cases of regulatory compliance or service-related obligations. This could be viewed as a balancing act in the contract, where the buyer has some protection but is still exposed to certain risks.

3. **Risk Management**: The limitation of liability clause is a risk management tool that helps both parties understand their potential financial exposure. For the buyer, having a cap can be beneficial, but the exceptions highlight areas where they could still face significant liabilities.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it illustrates how liability caps can be structured in contracts, balancing the interests of both parties while providing a degree of protection to the buyer. However, the presence of exceptions also emphasizes the need for buyers to carefully consider the implications of such clauses in the context of their overall risk exposure.",4
buyer-favorable cap on liability clauses,f52cb3b7ad,"IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER’S OR SELLER’S LIABILITY, ONE TO THE OTHER, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE RESPECTIVE OTHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD 13 MILLION; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO BAD FAITH, INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A PARTY, ITS EMPLOYEES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, OR TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR OTHER OBLIGATION SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.","The clause provided is a liability cap clause that limits the amount of damages that either party (the buyer or the seller) can claim against the other in the event of a breach of the agreement. Specifically, it states that neither party's liability for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, or other obligations under the agreement shall exceed USD 13 million. 

This clause is relevant to the query about buyer-favorable caps on liability clauses for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes a clear financial limit on the potential liability of both parties, which is a common practice in contracts to manage risk. This is particularly favorable for buyers as it provides them with a predictable maximum exposure in case of a breach.

2. **Exclusions from the Cap**: The clause includes exceptions to the liability cap, specifically for claims arising from bad faith, intentional or willful misconduct, and third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. This is important because it ensures that the cap does not protect a party from serious misconduct, which is a buyer-favorable aspect as it allows them to seek full remedies in cases of egregious behavior.

3. **Balance of Interests**: While the clause limits liability, it also acknowledges the need for accountability in cases of serious breaches. This balance can be seen as favorable to buyers, as it provides them with a safety net while still holding the seller accountable for significant wrongdoing.

4. **Risk Management**: For buyers, having a cap on liability helps in financial planning and risk assessment. Knowing that their maximum exposure is limited to USD 13 million allows buyers to make informed decisions regarding the transaction and their potential liabilities.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it exemplifies a buyer-favorable approach to liability by capping potential damages while also ensuring that serious breaches are not shielded by that cap. This structure helps protect the buyer's interests in the event of a breach of contract.",5
buyer-favorable cap on liability clauses,ff35aa7411,"9. Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties waive and relinquish any claims, demands, causes of action or recoveries for punitive damages, exemplary damages, or statutory damages. Seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the sale of the products, including any lost revenues or profits, consequential and/or incidental damages, business interruption or damage to business reputation, regardless of the theory upon which any claim may be based, including any statutory causes of action or claims. In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","The clause provided outlines a limitation of liability that is generally favorable to the seller, which may not align with the buyer's interests. Here’s how it relates to the query regarding buyer-favorable caps on liability clauses:

1. **Waiver of Certain Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the parties waive claims for punitive, exemplary, or statutory damages. This is a common practice in contracts, but it can be unfavorable for the buyer, as it limits the types of damages they can claim in the event of a breach.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect and Consequential Damages**: The clause also excludes liability for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that if the seller's actions (or inactions) lead to losses that are not directly tied to the product itself (like lost profits or damage to business reputation), the buyer cannot seek compensation. This is particularly concerning for buyers who may suffer significant indirect losses due to a seller's breach.

3. **Cap on Liability**: The clause caps the seller's liability to the purchase price actually paid by the buyer for the products. This means that regardless of the extent of the damages incurred by the buyer, they cannot recover more than what they paid for the products. This cap can be seen as a significant limitation on the buyer's ability to recover losses, making it a seller-favorable term.

4. **Implications for Buyers**: For a buyer, a more favorable cap on liability would ideally allow for recovery of a broader range of damages, including consequential damages, or at least a higher cap than the purchase price. The current clause restricts the buyer's recourse significantly, which is contrary to the goal of establishing buyer-favorable terms.

In summary, this limitation of liability clause is relevant to the query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable approach to liability, which could be a point of negotiation for buyers seeking more protective terms in their contracts. Buyers typically aim for clauses that allow for greater recovery in the event of a breach, including higher caps on liability and the inclusion of consequential damages.",5

(a) Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy and the limit of
Seller's liability for Goods or Services proven to be other than warranted,

breach of contract or any other legal theory, shall be, at Seller's option:
(i) replacement of the Goods or Services, without charge, carriage paid
to Buyer's facility; or (ii) refund of the purchase price paid in respect of
such Goods or Services, plus commercially reasonable charges in
connection with the return or disposition of Goods.
(b) Seller's sole liability with respect to the Goods and
Services, for any and all loss or damage to Buyer, or any other loss,
damage, expense or claim, resulting from any cause whatsoever (whether
based on damaged or defective Goods, irrespective of whether such
damages or defects are discoverable or latent, or Seller's limited warranty
shall fail of its essential purpose, or any other reason), and whether based
upon breach of warranty, negligence, strict liability, tort, breach of
contract or any other theory, shall in no event exceed the aggregate
purchase price of the particular Goods or the price of the Services with
respect to which losses, damages, expenses or costs are claimed. Seller
shall have no liability for the cost (of labor, disposal or otherwise) to
remove a Good or install any new product(s). Seller shall have no
liability to any person other than Buyer by virtue of the sale of the Goods,
provision of Services, or any other matters contemplated by the
Agreement, and Buyer shall add Seller as a party protected by Buyer’s
warranty and limit of liability provisions in Buyer’s terms of sale. The
limitation of liability set forth in this paragraph shall survive termination,
expiration or cancellation of the Agreement.
(c) THE FOREGOING IS THE ENTIRE

(d) No statement or recommendation made or
assistance given by Seller, or its representatives, either oral or in any
literature or other documentation, to Buyer, its customers or any other
persons in connection with the purchase, use or installation by Buyer, its
customers or any other persons, of any Good or Services sold hereunder,
shall constitute a waiver by Seller of any provision hereof or affect
Seller's liability as herein defined; and no such statement,
recommendation or assistance that is not expressly required by the
Agreement shall subject Seller to any liability of any nature whatsoever.","The clause provided outlines the limitations of liability for the Seller in relation to the Goods or Services provided to the Buyer. It is particularly relevant to the query about buyer-favorable caps on liability clauses for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Seller's Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the Seller's liability is capped at the aggregate purchase price of the Goods or Services in question. This is a common practice in contracts to limit the financial exposure of the Seller, but it can be seen as unfavorable to the Buyer, especially if the potential damages exceed the purchase price.

2. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**: The clause includes a broad exclusion of consequential, special, incidental, indirect, or punitive damages. This means that if the Buyer suffers losses beyond the direct costs of the Goods or Services (such as lost profits or other indirect damages), the Seller will not be liable. This is typically a buyer-unfavorable provision, as it limits the Buyer's ability to recover for significant losses that may arise from the Seller's breach.

3. **Exclusive Remedy**: The clause states that the Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy for any issues with the Goods or Services is either a replacement or a refund. This restricts the Buyer's options for recourse in the event of a problem, which can be seen as a disadvantage to the Buyer.

4. **Survival of Limitations**: The limitation of liability provisions are stated to survive the termination, expiration, or cancellation of the Agreement. This means that even after the contract ends, the Buyer cannot pursue claims beyond the specified limits, which further protects the Seller.

5. **No Third-Party Liability**: The clause also specifies that the Seller has no liability to any person other than the Buyer. This limits the Buyer's ability to seek recourse on behalf of third parties who may be affected by the Goods or Services.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable cap on liability, which limits the Seller's financial exposure while restricting the Buyer's remedies and potential recovery in the event of a breach. For a buyer-favorable cap on liability, one would typically seek to negotiate terms that allow for greater recovery options, fewer exclusions of damages, and a higher cap on liability.",5
non-reliance clause,dd24d14bea,"20. No Reliance No third party is entitled to rely on any of the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement. The Parties assume no liability to any third party because of any reliance on the representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement.","The non-reliance clause you provided is directly relevant to the query regarding non-reliance clauses in legal contracts. This clause explicitly states that no third party is entitled to rely on the representations, warranties, and agreements contained in the agreement. Here’s how it is relevant:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause protects the parties involved in the agreement from any liability to third parties who might claim to have relied on the representations and warranties made in the contract. This is a common purpose of non-reliance clauses, as they aim to limit the scope of liability to only the parties to the agreement.

2. **Clarification of Intent**: By stating that third parties cannot rely on the representations and warranties, the clause clarifies the intent of the parties that the agreement is meant solely for their benefit. This helps prevent misunderstandings or disputes that could arise if a third party attempts to assert rights based on the contract.

3. **Legal Protection**: Including a non-reliance clause can provide legal protection for the parties by reinforcing that any reliance on the contract's terms by third parties is unwarranted. This can be particularly important in complex transactions where multiple parties may be involved.

4. **Consistency with Other Provisions**: The clause aligns with the general practice in contracts to include disclaimers regarding reliance on representations and warranties, ensuring that the parties are not held accountable for statements made in the agreement that are not intended for third-party reliance.

In summary, the non-reliance clause serves to protect the parties from potential claims by third parties and clarifies the intended scope of the agreement, making it a critical component in the context of contractual relationships.",5

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Benefit of the Parties**: The clause states that the agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties involved, meaning that no third parties can claim rights or benefits from it. This aligns with the principle of non-reliance, which often emphasizes that parties should not rely on representations or agreements made outside of the written contract.

2. **Non-assignability**: By stating that no party may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under the agreement, the clause reinforces the idea that the parties are bound by the terms of the contract as written. This prevents any party from transferring their responsibilities or benefits to another party, which could lead to reliance on external entities not originally part of the agreement.

3. **Null and Void Assignments**: The clause specifies that any assignment made in contravention of this provision is null and void. This further emphasizes that the parties should not rely on any external agreements or assignments that are not explicitly recognized within the contract.

In summary, this clause supports the non-reliance principle by clarifying that the agreement is intended only for the parties involved and that they should not depend on any external parties or agreements that are not part of the written contract.

3. **Clarity and Certainty**: The clause provides clarity regarding the scope of the agreement and the limitations on what parties can rely upon. This is important in legal contexts, as it helps to avoid disputes over what was said or implied outside of the written agreement.

Here's how it relates to your query:

1. **Definition of ""As-Is""**: The clause explicitly states that the materials and services are provided on an ""as-is"" basis. This means that the receiving party accepts the materials and services in their current state, without any guarantees or warranties regarding their quality, performance, or suitability for a particular purpose.

### Explanation of the Clause:

1. **Definition of ""As-Is"":** The clause explicitly states that the services provided under the agreement are offered ""as is."" This means that the party providing the services (in this case, MLX and HCI) does not guarantee the quality, performance, or suitability of those services. The recipient of the services accepts them in their current state, without any assurances or warranties.

2. **Limitations on Warranties:** The clause goes on to clarify that no additional representations, warranties, or conditions are provided, either express or implied. This includes disclaimers regarding various aspects such as:
   - The uninterrupted or error-free operation of the services.
   - The merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose of the services.
   - Any warranties arising from statutes, trade usage, or previous dealings.

3. **Legal Implications:** By including an ""as-is"" clause, the parties are effectively limiting their liability. If the services do not meet the expectations of the receiving party, they cannot claim damages based on the lack of warranties or guarantees, as they have agreed to accept the services in their existing condition.

### Relevance to the Query:

The clause serves as a clear example of how ""as-is"" clauses function in legal agreements. It illustrates the intent of the parties to limit liability and set expectations regarding the quality and performance of the services provided. Understanding this clause is crucial for parties entering into agreements that include ""as-is"" provisions, as it outlines the risks and limitations associated with accepting services without guarantees.",5

An ""as-is"" clause typically indicates that a party is accepting a product, service, or asset in its current condition, without any warranties or guarantees from the seller or provider regarding its quality, performance, or suitability for a particular purpose.

In the clause you shared, the parties explicitly disclaim all representations and warranties related to the trademarks and name and appearance rights. This means that the parties are stating that they are not providing any assurances about the trademarks' quality, ownership, or fitness for use. The inclusion of phrases like ""expressly disclaim all representations and warranties"" and ""the AS PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE"" reinforces the idea that the trademarks are being provided ""as-is."" 

Furthermore, the clause limits liability for any damages arising from the use of these trademarks, indicating that the parties are not responsible for any negative outcomes that may result from MusclePharm's use of the trademarks. This aligns with the typical purpose of an ""as-is"" clause, which is to protect the provider from future claims or liabilities related to the condition or performance of the item in question.

Overall, this clause serves to clarify the extent of the parties' responsibilities and liabilities, emphasizing that the trademarks are accepted without any guarantees, which is a key characteristic of ""as-is"" clauses in contracts.",5

1. **Definition of ""As-Is""**: The clause explicitly states that the licenses granted under the agreement are provided ""as-is,"" meaning that the party granting the license does not provide any guarantees or warranties regarding the quality, performance, or suitability of the licensed material. This is a common legal language used to limit liability and clarify that the receiving party accepts the item or service in its current state.

2. **Exclusion of Warranties**: The clause goes further to exclude and disclaim any warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory. This includes important implied warranties such as merchantability (the product is fit for sale) and fitness for a particular purpose (the product is suitable for the specific use intended by the buyer). By including this language, the parties are making it clear that they cannot hold each other liable for any issues that may arise from the use of the licensed material.

3. **Risk Assumption**: By agreeing to an ""as-is"" clause, the receiving party assumes the risk associated with the quality and performance of the licensed material. This is crucial in negotiations, as it can affect the parties' willingness to enter into the agreement and their expectations regarding potential issues.

4. **Legal Implications**: The inclusion of an ""as-is"" clause can have significant legal implications, particularly in disputes. If a party later claims that the product or service did not meet their expectations or had defects, the ""as-is"" clause can serve as a defense for the party that provided the license, as it clearly states that no warranties were made.

In summary, the ""as-is"" clause is a critical component of the agreement that defines the nature of the licenses being granted and limits the liability of the parties involved.

This is a common provision in contracts to limit liability and set expectations regarding the condition of what is being provided.

2. **Carveouts**: The phrase ""EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT"" serves as a carveout. It indicates that while the general rule is that no representations or warranties are made, there may be specific instances within the agreement where representations or warranties are indeed provided. This allows for certain exceptions to the ""as is"" disclaimer, ensuring that if there are explicit warranties or representations stated elsewhere in the agreement, those will still be valid and enforceable.

3. **Disclaiming Implied Warranties**: The clause also disclaims any implied warranties, such as those of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. This further reinforces the ""as is"" nature of the agreement while also clarifying that the parties are not liable for any issues that may arise from the use of the materials or services provided.

In summary, this clause effectively communicates the intent of the parties to limit their liability regarding the quality and performance of the materials and services, while also allowing for specific exceptions where warranties may still apply. This aligns with the concept of an ""as is"" clause with carveouts, as it establishes a baseline of no warranties while permitting certain exceptions.",5

This clause shall survive termination of this JSMA.","The clause you provided is an ""Indemnification"" clause, which outlines the responsibilities of Vertex and Bunker One to indemnify each other for certain damages, losses, and liabilities arising from their actions or breaches of the agreement. While it does not explicitly contain an ""as is"" clause, it is relevant to the concept of ""as is"" clauses with carveouts in the following ways:

1. **Understanding ""As Is"" Clauses**: An ""as is"" clause typically indicates that one party is accepting a product or service in its current state, without any warranties or guarantees from the other party. However, such clauses often include carveouts that specify exceptions to this general acceptance, particularly regarding certain liabilities or breaches.

2. **Carveouts for Indemnification**: The indemnification clause serves as a carveout to an ""as is"" provision. It specifies that even if the parties agree to accept the services or products ""as is,"" they still have the right to seek indemnification for damages resulting from negligence, gross negligence, or intentional acts. This means that the parties cannot completely absolve themselves of liability for serious misconduct or breaches of the agreement.

3. **Protection Against Breaches**: The indemnification clause provides a safety net for both parties, ensuring that if one party suffers losses due to the other party's failure to meet their obligations or due to wrongful actions, they can seek compensation. This is particularly important in the context of an ""as is"" clause, as it balances the acceptance of risk with the right to seek redress for specific, serious issues.

4. **Survival of Obligations**: The clause states that the indemnification obligations survive the termination of the agreement. This is significant because it means that even after the agreement ends, parties can still be held accountable for actions that occurred during the term of the agreement, which is another important consideration when drafting or interpreting ""as is"" clauses with carveouts.

In summary, while the indemnification clause does not directly state an ""as is"" provision, it complements the concept by providing a framework for liability and accountability that can coexist with an ""as is"" acceptance of services or products. It ensures that parties are protected against certain risks, even when they agree to accept something in its current condition.",5
"""as is"" clause with carveouts",a685483a0f,"5. Sponsor's Maximum Obligation; Indemnification. Racing represents to the Sponsor that the Sponsor's aggregate obligation hereunder will not exceed the amount of the sponsorship fee set forth in Section 3 hereof (or such lesser amount as is payable by the Sponsor in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14 hereof), plus, if applicable, collection costs that may be reasonably incurred by Racing in a legal proceeding to collect all or any part thereof (the ""Maximum Obligation""). Racing agrees to indemnify the Sponsor and its officers, directors, agents and employees and to hold them harmless from any loss, claim, cost, damage or liability in excess of the Maximum Obligation which (i) the Sponsor shall incur as a result of this Agreement, or (ii) arises from any failure by Racing to perform any of its obligations hereunder.","The clause provided outlines the Sponsor's maximum obligation and indemnification responsibilities of Racing. It is relevant to the query regarding an ""as is"" clause with carveouts in the following ways:

1. **""As Is"" Clause Context**: An ""as is"" clause typically indicates that a party is accepting a product or service in its current state, without any warranties or guarantees from the seller regarding its condition or performance. In this context, if Racing were to include an ""as is"" clause, it would mean that the Sponsor accepts the sponsorship arrangement without any assurances from Racing about the outcomes or performance of the sponsorship.

2. **Carveouts**: The clause includes specific carveouts related to Racing's indemnification obligations. It states that Racing will indemnify the Sponsor for any losses or liabilities that exceed the ""Maximum Obligation."" This means that while the Sponsor may be accepting the sponsorship ""as is,"" Racing is still responsible for certain liabilities that arise from its failure to perform its obligations under the agreement. This creates a balance between the ""as is"" acceptance and the protection of the Sponsor against significant losses.

3. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause limits Racing's liability to the Maximum Obligation, which is a common feature in contracts that include ""as is"" provisions. It clarifies that while the Sponsor is accepting the sponsorship arrangement without guarantees, there are still defined limits to Racing's financial responsibility, which can be seen as a carveout to the general acceptance of risk.

4. **Indemnification**: The indemnification aspect of the clause serves as a protective measure for the Sponsor, ensuring that they are not left entirely exposed to risks associated with Racing's performance. This is particularly important in an ""as is"" context, where the Sponsor might otherwise have limited recourse for issues that arise.

In summary, the clause is relevant to the query as it illustrates how an ""as is"" acceptance can coexist with specific protections (carveouts) for the Sponsor, particularly through indemnification for liabilities that exceed a defined limit. This balance is crucial in contractual agreements to ensure that one party does not bear undue risk while still accepting the terms of the agreement.",5

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AS PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.","The clause you provided contains an ""as is"" provision with specific carveouts, which is relevant to your query regarding the use of such clauses in legal contracts.

1. **""As Is"" Disclaimer**: The clause begins with a clear disclaimer of all representations and warranties by the parties involved, except for those that are explicitly stated in the agreement. This aligns with the concept of an ""as is"" clause, which typically indicates that the buyer or user accepts the item or service in its current condition, without any guarantees from the seller or provider.

2. **Carveouts**: The phrase ""EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN"" serves as a carveout, indicating that while the parties are disclaiming all other warranties, there may be specific representations or warranties that are still valid and enforceable as outlined in the agreement. This is important because it allows for certain protections or assurances to remain in place, even while the general liability is limited.

3. **Limitations on Liability**: The clause further specifies that the parties shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use of the trademarks and name and appearance rights, which is another form of limitation on liability. This is a common feature in ""as is"" clauses, where the parties seek to limit their exposure to claims or damages that may arise from the use of the subject matter of the agreement.

4. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the parties will not be liable for special, consequential, or punitive damages. This further reinforces the ""as is"" nature of the agreement, as it limits the scope of potential claims that could be made against the parties.

In summary, this clause exemplifies how an ""as is"" provision can be structured with specific carveouts to protect certain rights or warranties while simultaneously limiting liability for other claims. It is a common practice in contracts to ensure that parties are aware of the limitations of their obligations and liabilities.",5

This means that the parties are agreeing to accept the materials and services in their current condition, without any guarantees or warranties regarding their quality, performance, or suitability for a particular purpose.

2. **Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause goes further to clarify that, except for any express representations or warranties stated in the agreement, no party makes any representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. This includes a broad disclaimer of implied warranties such as merchantability, non-infringement, or fitness for a particular purpose.

3. **Legal Implications**: An unqualified ""as is"" clause typically limits the liability of the party providing the materials or services, as it indicates that the receiving party cannot hold the provider accountable for any defects or issues that may arise after the transfer. This is significant in legal contexts, as it can affect the rights of the parties in case of disputes.

4. **Contextual Relevance**: In the context of the external information provided, particularly the mention of specific performance and the waiver of defenses, the ""as is"" clause can impact the enforceability of claims related to the quality or performance of the materials and services. If a party attempts to seek specific performance or remedies based on the quality of the materials, the ""as is"" clause may serve as a defense against such claims.

In summary, the Section 9.3 Disclaimer clause is a clear example of an unqualified ""as is"" clause, which serves to limit the liability of the parties and clarify the nature of the agreement regarding the materials and services provided.",5

1. **Definition of ""As Is""**: The clause explicitly states that the services provided under the agreement are offered ""as is."" This means that the party providing the services (in this case, MLX and HCI) is not making any guarantees or warranties regarding the quality, performance, or suitability of those services. The recipient of the services accepts them in their current state, without any assurances from the provider.

2. **Scope of Warranties**: The clause goes on to clarify that no additional warranties are provided, either express or implied.

This reinforces the ""as is"" nature of the services, indicating that the provider is not liable for any issues that may arise.

3. **Legal Implications**: An unqualified ""as is"" clause typically limits the liability of the provider and shifts the risk to the recipient. By including such a clause, the provider is protecting itself from claims related to the quality or performance of the services, as the recipient acknowledges that they are accepting the services without any guarantees.

4. **Relevance to Contractual Obligations**: In the context of contractual obligations, this clause is significant because it sets clear expectations for both parties. The recipient cannot later claim that they were misled about the quality or performance of the services, as they have agreed to accept them ""as is.""

1. **Limitation of Representations and Warranties**: The clause explicitly states that the only representations and warranties that are valid are those that are expressly stated in the agreement.

2. **Legal Context**: The clause acknowledges that some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain implied warranties, which is important for compliance with local laws. However, it asserts that where permissible, these warranties are disclaimed, reinforcing the waiver of any implied warranty of title and non-infringement.

3. **Limitation of Duration**: The clause also mentions that if an implied warranty cannot be excluded, it is limited in duration to the warranty period. This is relevant because it sets a boundary on the duration of any implied warranty that might still apply, further limiting the liability of the party providing the warranty.

4. **Legal Rights**: The clause concludes by stating that the warranty gives the customer specific legal rights, which may vary by jurisdiction. This is important because it indicates that while the implied warranties are waived, the customer may still have other rights under the law, which could include claims related to title or non-infringement.

This is a direct reference to the waiver of implied warranties, which is a key aspect of the query.

2. **Non-Infringement**: The clause specifically mentions ""non-infringement of any intellectual property right of any third party."" This indicates that the Seller is not providing any warranty that the Products do not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights, which is a critical component of the waiver of implied warranty of non-infringement.

3. **Assumption of Risk by Buyer**: The clause states that the Buyer assumes all risk and liability resulting from the use of the Products.

4. **Notification Requirement**: The clause also outlines a process for the Buyer to notify the Seller of any claims regarding the Products within a specified timeframe.

2. **Specific Exclusions**: Importantly, the clause explicitly mentions that Cisco does not make any representation or warranty regarding ownership of intellectual property or proprietary rights, nor does it address infringement or misappropriation of those rights.

It reinforces the idea that the Buyer cannot seek additional damages beyond what is specified in the contract.

3. **Types of Damages Excluded**: The clause further clarifies that neither party will be liable for special, incidental, punitive, consequential, indirect, or exemplary damages. This exclusion is significant because it narrows the scope of potential claims that could arise from a breach of warranty, thereby reinforcing the exclusivity of the remedies provided.

4. **Adequate Remedies**: The clause concludes with the statement that ""the remedies contained herein are adequate remedies."" This suggests that both parties have agreed that the specified remedies are sufficient to address any breaches, which is a key aspect of establishing an exclusive remedy framework.

SAID REPLACEMENT IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF BUYER.","The clause provided is highly relevant to the query regarding the ""exclusive remedy for breach of product warranty."" Here’s how it connects:

1. **Limited Warranty**: The clause begins by stating that the seller provides a limited warranty, specifically that the products comply with the specifications identified in writing. This establishes the basis for any warranty claims.

2. **Disclaimer of Other Warranties**: The clause explicitly states that, aside from the express warranty mentioned, the seller disclaims all other warranties, both express and implied. This includes warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This disclaimer is crucial because it limits the buyer's expectations regarding the product's performance and the seller's liability.

3. **Exclusion of Liability for Damages**: The clause goes on to exclude liability for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, and special damages. This means that if the product fails to meet the warranty, the seller is not liable for any indirect losses the buyer may incur as a result.

4. **Exclusive Remedy**: The clause concludes by stating that the sole and exclusive remedy for the buyer, in the event that the products do not satisfy the specifications, is the replacement of the products at the seller's expense. This clearly defines the limits of the seller's obligations and the buyer's recourse in case of a breach of warranty.

In summary, this clause outlines the limited nature of the warranty provided by the seller, disclaims broader liability, and specifies that the only remedy available to the buyer for a breach of warranty is the replacement of non-conforming products. This aligns directly with the concept of an ""exclusive remedy"" in warranty law, as it restricts the buyer's options to a specific course of action in the event of a breach.",5

1. **Exclusivity of Remedy**: The clause explicitly states that the sole remedy for any issues related to defective parts is limited to repair, replacement, or credit.

1. **Exclusive Remedy**: The clause explicitly states that the remedy for defective or nonconforming products is limited to either replacement of the product by the Seller at no additional charge or a refund of the purchase price upon the return of the product.

3. **Waiver of Other Claims**: The clause also includes a provision that any claims must be reported within a specific timeframe (ten days for damage, defect, or shortage, and one hundred fifty days for other claims).

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that the representations and warranties included in the agreement are the only warranties provided by the parties. This limits the seller's liability by preventing the buyer from claiming any additional warranties beyond those expressly stated in the agreement.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause disclaims all other warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory. This includes important implied warranties such as those of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. By excluding these warranties, the seller protects itself from potential claims that could arise from the buyer's expectations or assumptions about the product or service.

3. **Clarity and Certainty**: The clause provides clarity by stating that any warranties not expressly included in the agreement are disclaimed. This helps to avoid ambiguity and potential disputes regarding what warranties may or may not apply.

4. **Specificity on Non-Infringement**: The clause also specifically disclaims any warranties of non-infringement that are not expressly stated in the agreement.

1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause explicitly states that, except for what is expressly stated in the agreement, neither party makes any representations or warranties regarding the subject matter. This broad disclaimer protects the seller by limiting their liability and ensuring that they are not held accountable for any implied warranties that could arise from the transaction.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause specifically mentions the exclusion of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This is particularly favorable to the seller, as it prevents buyers from claiming that the goods or services provided do not meet certain standards or purposes that the buyer may have assumed.

3. **Limitation of Liability**: By including a disclaimer of warranties, the seller is effectively limiting their liability for any issues that may arise post-transaction. This is advantageous for the seller, as it reduces the risk of legal claims based on unmet expectations or perceived deficiencies in the product or service.

4. **Industry Standards**: The clause also mentions the exclusion of warranties arising from course of dealing, course of performance, or usage in the industry. This further protects the seller by ensuring that they are not bound by any informal practices or standards that may be assumed in the industry, which could otherwise lead to liability.

3. **Clarity and Certainty**: This type of clause provides clarity to both parties about the extent of the seller's obligations. It ensures that the buyer cannot later claim that the seller provided a warranty that was not explicitly stated in the agreement, thus reducing the risk of disputes.

4. **Seller's Position**: The clause is structured to favor the seller by placing the burden on the buyer to understand that they are accepting the goods or services ""as is,"" without any additional guarantees from the seller. This is a common practice in contracts where the seller wants to minimize their risk and exposure to liability.

Here’s how it aligns with the request:

1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause explicitly states that neither party makes any representations or warranties regarding the agreement or the transactions contemplated. This is a seller-favorable position because it limits the seller's liability by waiving any implied warranties that could be claimed by the buyer.

2. **Specific Exclusions**: The clause goes further to specifically disclaim any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. This is advantageous for the seller as it protects them from claims that the goods or services provided do not meet certain standards or expectations.

3. **Limitation on Expectations**: By stating that there are no warranties regarding the amount of sales revenues or any economic benefits from the agreement, the seller is effectively managing the buyer's expectations. This reduces the risk of future claims based on the buyer's anticipated outcomes from the agreement.

4. **Legal Protection**: The waiver of warranties serves as a legal shield for the seller, making it clear that the buyer cannot hold the seller accountable for any issues that arise from the agreement, except for the specific sums to be paid as outlined in the agreement.

Here's how it relates to your query about seller-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses:

1. **Broad Disclaimer of Warranties**: The clause explicitly states that the parties (likely the seller and buyer) disclaim all warranties, both express and implied. This means that the seller is not making any promises about the quality, performance, or suitability of the goods or services being sold, except for what is expressly stated in another section (Section 12). This protects the seller from liability for any issues that may arise after the sale.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: By including a disclaimer of implied warranties, such as those of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, the seller limits their exposure to claims from the buyer. If the buyer later finds that the product does not meet their expectations or needs, they cannot hold the seller accountable for these implied warranties.

3. **Encouragement of Due Diligence**: This clause encourages the buyer to conduct their own due diligence before entering into the agreement. Since the seller is not providing any warranties beyond what is explicitly stated, the buyer must ensure that they are satisfied with the product or service before completing the transaction.

4. **Legal Protection**: In the event of a dispute, this clause provides the seller with a strong legal defense against claims related to warranty breaches. It establishes a clear understanding that the buyer accepted the terms of the agreement with the knowledge that no additional warranties were provided.

1. **General Disclaimer**: The clause states that neither party makes any representations or warranties regarding the agreement or the transactions contemplated, which is a common feature in warranty disclaimers. This means that the parties are not guaranteeing any specific outcomes or benefits from the agreement, which can be seen as a protective measure for the seller.

2. **Specific Waivers**: The clause explicitly waives and disclaims implied warranties such as merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. This is significant because it limits the buyer's ability to claim that the product or service provided under the agreement meets certain standards or is suitable for a specific use, which could be unfavorable for the buyer.

3. **Limitation on Expectations**: The clause also specifically disclaims any representation regarding potential sales revenues or economic benefits that might arise from the agreement. This further protects the seller by ensuring that the buyer cannot hold them accountable for any financial expectations that were not explicitly stated in the agreement.

This means that the buyer cannot rely on any assurances or guarantees that are not explicitly included in the contract, which can be detrimental to the buyer's interests.

2. **Exclusion of Implied Warranties**: The clause explicitly disclaims implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. These implied warranties are typically important for buyers, as they ensure that the goods or services provided meet certain minimum standards.

3. **Limitation on Liability**: The clause limits the seller's liability by stating that they are not responsible for any warranties or conditions arising from the course of dealing, performance, or industry usage.

Here’s how it relates to the query for buyer-favorable warranty disclaimer clauses:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause states that the reseller (the buyer) shall make no representations, guarantees, or warranties concerning the company product except as expressly authorized by the company in writing. This places the burden on the reseller to ensure that any claims made about the product are pre-approved, which can limit the reseller's ability to market the product effectively.

2. **Indemnification**: The clause includes indemnification provisions where the company agrees to indemnify the reseller for losses suffered due to the company products, but it also requires the reseller to indemnify the company for losses related to the reseller's activities. This mutual indemnification can be seen as a way to protect the company while potentially exposing the reseller to liability, which is not favorable for the buyer.

3. **Lack of Warranty**: The absence of any warranty from the company regarding the product means that the reseller has no recourse if the product fails to meet expectations or if there are defects. This is a significant risk for the buyer, as they are left without assurances about the quality or performance of the product.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query because it exemplifies a warranty disclaimer that is not favorable to the buyer.

This is a core function of an indemnity clause, which is to protect certain parties from financial loss due to claims made against them.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies the types of claims and liabilities covered, such as those arising from misrepresentations, omissions, or breaches of the Corporation's obligations. This detailed scope is typical in indemnity clauses, as it clarifies what situations trigger the indemnification obligation.

3. **Exclusions**: The clause also includes limitations on indemnification, stating that it does not apply if a court finds that the indemnified parties were negligent or engaged in fraudulent or illegal acts. This is important as it sets boundaries on the indemnity, ensuring that it does not cover wrongful conduct.

4. **Notification and Defense**: The clause outlines the process for notifying the Corporation of claims and the rights of the Indemnified Parties regarding legal representation. This procedural aspect is crucial in indemnity clauses, as it ensures that the indemnifying party (the Corporation) is informed and can manage the defense of claims effectively.

5. **Trust for Non-Parties**: The clause mentions that rights under this indemnity section can be held in trust for Indemnified Parties who are not signatories to the agreement. This broadens the protection offered by the indemnity clause to include third parties, which is a common feature in indemnity provisions.

6. **Legal Counsel**: It specifies the conditions under which the Indemnified Parties can retain separate legal counsel, which is a critical aspect of indemnity clauses, ensuring that the interests of the indemnified parties are adequately represented.

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **Definition of Unilateral Indemnification**: A unilateral indemnification clause typically means that only one party agrees to indemnify the other party for certain losses or claims, without a reciprocal obligation from the other party. In contrast, the clause you provided includes mutual indemnification obligations, where both parties agree to indemnify each other.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause specifies that each party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party from losses arising from breaches of the agreement or negligence. This mutuality indicates that both parties have obligations to protect each other, which is characteristic of a bilateral indemnification clause.

3. **Claims Procedure**: The clause outlines a detailed procedure for how claims will be handled, including notification requirements and the rights of the indemnifying party to control the defense of claims. This procedural aspect is relevant in both unilateral and bilateral indemnification clauses, but the presence of mutual obligations distinguishes it from a unilateral approach.

4. **Legal Implications**: The enforceability of unilateral indemnification clauses can vary by jurisdiction, and they may be subject to specific legal standards. The clause provided does not address unilateral indemnification, but understanding its bilateral nature is crucial for assessing the legal implications and potential risks involved.

In summary, while the clause you provided is comprehensive and outlines the indemnification process, it does not represent a unilateral indemnification clause.

In the clause you provided, both parties agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend each other. This means that if one party incurs losses or liabilities due to the actions or responsibilities of the other party, the responsible party must cover those losses. This mutual approach contrasts with a unilateral indemnification clause, where only one party would bear the responsibility for indemnification.

In summary, while the clause addresses indemnification, it does not fulfill the criteria of a unilateral indemnification clause, as it requires both parties to indemnify each other rather than placing the obligation solely on one party. If you are looking for a unilateral indemnification clause, it would typically state that one party agrees to indemnify the other without a reciprocal obligation.",5

1. **Mutual Indemnification**: The clause indicates that both parties have obligations to indemnify each other. This means that if one party breaches the agreement or engages in gross negligence or willful misconduct, they are responsible for covering the losses incurred by the other party.

This means that only one side bears the responsibility for indemnification, which can create an imbalance in risk and liability.

In summary, while the provided clause is an example of mutual indemnification, it serves as a point of comparison to understand what a unilateral indemnification clause would entail. A unilateral clause would not include the reciprocal obligations seen here, and it would place the burden of indemnification solely on one party. Understanding this distinction is crucial when drafting or negotiating contracts, as it affects the risk exposure and liability of the parties involved.",5

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies the conditions under which indemnification applies, namely breaches of the agreement or gross negligence/willful misconduct by the Indemnifying Party. This specificity is common in unilateral indemnification clauses, as it delineates the circumstances under which the indemnifying party is liable.

3. **Protection for Indemnified Parties**: The clause serves to protect the Indemnified Parties from various losses, which is a primary purpose of indemnification clauses. It ensures that if the Indemnifying Party fails to meet its obligations or acts negligently, the other party will not suffer financial harm.

4. **Legal Framework**: The clause aligns with the legal principles surrounding indemnification, where one party agrees to cover the losses of another under certain conditions.

For example, if only the Owner were to indemnify the Operator without any corresponding obligation from the Operator to indemnify the Owner, that would be a unilateral indemnification clause.

3. **Relevance to the Query**: Understanding the structure of the provided indemnification clause helps clarify what a unilateral indemnification clause would look like. If the clause were to be modified to be unilateral, it would only include the obligations of one party (e.g., only the Owner indemnifying the Operator) without any corresponding obligations from the Operator. 

In summary, the provided clause serves as a comparison point to illustrate the concept of unilateral indemnification by showing how mutual indemnification operates and how it differs from a scenario where only one party bears the indemnification responsibility.",5

VS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PPD, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any claim, action or proceeding by a third party (a ""Third Party Claim"") arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations between two parties, VS and PPD, specifically in relation to third-party claims. This is directly relevant to your query about indemnification of third-party claims for several reasons:

1. **Definition of Indemnification**: The clause explicitly states that VS shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless PPD and its affiliates from any damages, costs, expenses, and liabilities arising from third-party claims due to VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement. Similarly, PPD has the same obligations towards VS. This establishes a mutual indemnification framework.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that indemnification covers ""any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities,"" which includes reasonable attorney's fees and court costs. This broad scope ensures that both parties are protected against a wide range of potential liabilities that may arise from third-party claims.

3. **Notice Requirement**: The clause requires the indemnified party to give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any third-party claim for which indemnification is sought. This is crucial for the indemnifying party to respond appropriately and manage the defense of the claim.

4. **Control of Defense**: The indemnifying party has the right to control the defense and settlement of the third-party claim, provided they act reasonably and in good faith. This gives the indemnifying party the ability to manage the legal strategy and costs associated with the claim.

5. **Cooperation and Participation**: The indemnified party is required to cooperate in the defense and settlement of the claim, while also having the right to participate in the defense with separate legal counsel at their own expense, unless certain conditions are met. This ensures that both parties are involved in the process while delineating responsibilities.

6. **Conditions for Control**: The clause outlines conditions under which the indemnified party can take control of the defense, such as if the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense. This provides a safety net for the indemnified party, ensuring they are not left without representation in critical situations.

Overall, this clause is a comprehensive indemnification provision that addresses the responsibilities and rights of both parties in the event of third-party claims, making it highly relevant to your query on indemnification of third-party claims.",5

Here’s how the clause relates to the query:

1. **Definition of Claim**: The clause begins by defining a ""Claim"" as any action or proceeding instituted by a third party, which is crucial for understanding the scope of indemnification. This definition establishes that the indemnification obligations apply to claims made by entities outside the parties involved in the agreement.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause specifies that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for defending and indemnifying the Indemnified Party against any claims arising from various specified circumstances, such as:
   - The operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's site.
   - The marketing or sale of products or services through that site.

   - Infringement of intellectual property rights.

3. **Costs and Expenses**: It also states that the Indemnifying Party will cover any costs, losses, damages, judgments, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of such claims.

4. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause also references a section (8.2) that limits liability for consequential damages, but it makes an exception for damages awarded to a third party in a judgment against which a party is entitled to indemnification.

2. **Liability Limitations**: 
   - Sections 11.6 and 11.7 establish limitations on liability for consequential damages and aggregate liability. However, they explicitly carve out exceptions for claims arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if a party commits fraud or acts with gross negligence, they cannot rely on these limitations to avoid liability. This is significant because it ensures that parties cannot escape accountability for serious misconduct.

3. **Consequential Damages**: 
   - The clause specifies that, except in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, neither party will be liable for consequential damages. This reinforces the importance of the exceptions for fraud and gross negligence, as it indicates that such actions can lead to full liability, including for consequential damages.

4. **Legal Recourse**: 
   - The provisions regarding indemnification and liability limitations provide a framework for legal recourse in the event of fraud or gross negligence. If either party suffers losses due to the other party's fraudulent or grossly negligent actions, they have the right to seek indemnification and potentially recover damages beyond the limitations set forth in the agreement.

Here’s how it is relevant to your query about fraud and/or gross negligence indemnity:

1. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**: Section 11.6 explicitly states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for consequential damages. However, it carves out exceptions for damages arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if a party commits fraud or acts with gross negligence, they cannot rely on this limitation to avoid liability for consequential damages resulting from those actions.

2. **Liability Limit**: Section 11.7 further clarifies that the limitation on liability does not apply to claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This reinforces the idea that parties can be held fully liable for such serious breaches, regardless of any caps on liability that might otherwise apply.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**: Sections 12.1 and 12.2 outline the indemnification responsibilities of each party. Both sections specify that indemnification applies in cases of negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct by the respective parties or their affiliates. This means that if one party's actions fall into these categories, they are obligated to indemnify the other party for any claims, losses, or damages that arise as a result.

4. **Scope of Indemnification**: The indemnification clauses are broad and cover a range of potential claims, including those arising from breaches of the agreement, inaccuracies in representations, and misconduct. This broad scope ensures that parties are protected against various risks associated with fraud and gross negligence.

1. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**: Section 11.6 states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, including lost profits or indirect damages. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for damages arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if one party commits fraud or acts with gross negligence, they cannot rely on this limitation to avoid liability for the resulting damages.

2. **Liability Limitations**: Section 11.7 further limits a party's aggregate liability under the agreement, but again, it specifies that this limitation does not apply to claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This reinforces the idea that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct, ensuring that they remain accountable for their actions.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also mentions that the limitations on liability do not apply to a party's indemnification obligations under Article 12. This is significant because indemnification often involves compensating another party for losses or damages incurred due to the actions of the indemnifying party, including those arising from fraud or gross negligence.

In summary, the clause establishes that while there are limitations on liability for general claims, parties are still held accountable for serious misconduct such as fraud and gross negligence. This aligns with the principles of indemnity, ensuring that parties cannot evade responsibility for their wrongful actions.",5

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Exclusions for Liability**: The clause explicitly states that, except for certain specified circumstances, neither party shall be liable for indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages. The exceptions listed include (A) fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence. This means that if a party commits fraud or acts with gross negligence, they cannot rely on this limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for damages.

2. **Indemnification Context**: The clause also mentions that damages required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification are not subject to the limitations outlined. This implies that if a party is found liable for fraud or gross negligence, they may be required to indemnify the other party for any resulting damages, including those that are typically excluded under this clause.

3. **Legal Implications**: The inclusion of fraud and gross negligence as exceptions indicates that the parties recognize the seriousness of these actions and the potential for significant harm. This aligns with legal principles that often hold parties accountable for such misconduct, regardless of any contractual limitations on liability.

4. **Protection of Parties**: By specifying these exceptions, the clause serves to protect parties from being shielded by contractual limitations in cases of serious wrongdoing. This is important in maintaining fairness and accountability in contractual relationships.

In summary, this clause directly addresses the issue of indemnity related to fraud and gross negligence by outlining the circumstances under which parties can be held liable despite general limitations on liability. It underscores the importance of accountability in cases of serious misconduct, ensuring that parties cannot escape liability for their wrongful actions through contractual provisions.",5

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Exclusions for Fraud**: The clause explicitly states that there are exceptions to the limitation of liability in cases of fraud. This means that if one party commits fraud, they cannot rely on this limitation to avoid liability for damages resulting from that fraud. This is significant because it ensures that parties cannot escape accountability for fraudulent actions, which is a critical aspect of indemnity in legal agreements.

2. **Breach of Specific Obligations**: The clause also mentions that liability limitations do not apply in the event of a party's breach of obligations under Article 7 (Intellectual Property) or Article 10 (Confidentiality). While this does not directly mention gross negligence, it indicates that certain breaches are treated with heightened seriousness, similar to how gross negligence might be viewed in terms of liability.

3. **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**: The clause allows for damages that are required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification. This implies that if a party is held liable to a third party due to their actions (which could include fraud or gross negligence), they may be indemnified by the other party, thus reinforcing the concept of indemnity in the context of serious breaches.

4. **Limitation on Types of Damages**: The clause limits liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, and other types of damages that are not foreseeable. This limitation is important in the context of indemnity because it clarifies the scope of damages that can be claimed, which can be particularly relevant in cases involving gross negligence or fraud, where the nature of damages might be more complex.

In summary, this clause outlines the boundaries of liability and indemnity in the context of fraud and potentially gross negligence, ensuring that parties are held accountable for serious breaches while also defining the scope of recoverable damages.

Here’s how it relates to the query regarding third-party IP infringement indemnity:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that NCM (one of the parties) is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Network Affiliate (the other party) against any costs arising from third-party claims related to IP infringement. This is directly relevant to the query as it establishes the responsibility of one party to protect the other from potential legal claims regarding IP rights.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: Section 10.3(a) specifies that NCM's indemnification covers claims arising from the infringement of third-party U.S. trademarks, copyrights, or patents, provided that the Network Affiliate uses the NCM Property in accordance with the agreement. This aligns with the concept of third-party IP infringement indemnity, as it protects the Network Affiliate from legal repercussions stemming from NCM's intellectual property.

3. **Limitations of Obligations**: Section 10.3(c) outlines certain limitations on NCM's indemnification obligations, indicating scenarios where NCM would not be liable for infringement claims. This is important for understanding the boundaries of the indemnity and clarifies that the indemnity is not absolute, which is a common feature in indemnification clauses.

4. **Defense of Action**: Section 10.4 discusses the rights of the indemnifying party (Indemnitor) to control the defense of any claims and the obligation of the indemnified party (Indemnitee) to notify the Indemnitor of claims promptly. This procedural aspect is crucial in managing how third-party claims are handled, ensuring that both parties understand their roles in the event of an infringement claim.

third party IP infringement indemnity,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided addresses liability limitations between the parties in the context of damages. Specifically, it states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages, except in cases where the claim or liability arises from the infringement of a third party's intellectual property (IP) rights.

This is highly relevant to the query regarding ""third party IP infringement indemnity"" for several reasons:

1. **Exemption from Liability Limitations**: The clause explicitly carves out an exception for claims related to third-party IP infringement. This means that if one party infringes on a third party's intellectual property rights, the usual limitations on liability (for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages) do not apply. This is significant because it indicates that the parties recognize the serious nature of IP infringement and are willing to accept greater liability in such cases.

2. **Indemnification Implications**: In the context of indemnity, this clause suggests that if one party's actions lead to a claim of IP infringement by a third party, that party may be required to indemnify the other party for any resulting damages, including those that would typically be excluded under the liability limitations. This aligns with common practices in contracts where indemnification for IP infringement is a critical concern.

3. **Risk Allocation**: The clause reflects the parties' agreement on how to allocate the risk associated with third-party IP claims. By excluding these claims from the liability limitations, the parties are acknowledging that the consequences of IP infringement can be significant and that they need to be prepared to address such risks appropriately.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it outlines the liability framework concerning third-party IP infringement, indicating that such claims are treated with a higher level of seriousness and potential liability than other types of claims, which is a key aspect of indemnity provisions in contracts.",5

3. **Notice and Control of Defense**: The clause requires the indemnified party to promptly notify the indemnifying party of any third-party claims. It also grants the indemnifying party the right to control the defense and settlement of such claims, provided they act reasonably and in good faith. This is important because it outlines the procedural aspects of how claims will be managed, ensuring that both parties understand their roles and responsibilities in the event of a third-party claim.

4. **Cooperation and Legal Counsel**: The clause also stipulates that the indemnified party must cooperate in the defense and settlement of the claim, and it allows the indemnified party to participate in the defense with separate legal counsel at their own expense unless certain conditions are met. This ensures that both parties have a say in the defense strategy while also protecting their interests.

In summary, this indemnification clause is crucial for addressing third-party claims that may arise from breaches of the agreement, as it clearly delineates the responsibilities of each party in such scenarios, thereby mitigating potential legal risks and liabilities.",5
indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement,6a700c0c62,"EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding indemnification of third-party claims based on breach of agreement in several ways:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly mentions that it pertains to indemnification obligations set forth in Section 9 regarding claims by third parties. This indicates that the parties have agreed to specific terms for indemnifying each other against claims made by third parties, which is a critical aspect of managing liability in contractual agreements.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause also establishes a limitation of liability for both parties, stating that neither party shall be liable for consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or enhanced damages, as well as lost profits or revenues, arising from any breach of the agreement. This limitation is significant because it delineates the scope of damages that can be claimed in the event of a breach, except for the indemnification obligations related to third-party claims.

3. **Scope of Damages**: By specifying that the limitation of liability does not apply to indemnification obligations for third-party claims, the clause underscores that while parties may not be liable for certain types of damages resulting from breaches, they are still responsible for indemnifying each other against claims made by third parties. This creates a clear distinction between direct contractual breaches and the responsibilities arising from third-party claims.

4. **Foreseeability and Notification**: The clause further clarifies that the limitation on liability applies regardless of whether the damages were foreseeable or if the parties were advised of the possibility of such damages. This reinforces the importance of the indemnification obligations, as they are not subject to the same limitations and are intended to protect against unforeseen claims from third parties.

In summary, this clause is crucial in defining the responsibilities of the parties concerning third-party claims and establishes a framework for indemnification that is separate from the general limitations on liability for breaches of the agreement. It ensures that parties are held accountable for claims made by third parties, which can often be more complex and significant than direct breaches of the contract.",5

This indicates that while parties may be indemnified for certain claims, there are limitations on liability for other types of damages.

2. **Indemnification Provisions**: The reference to ""amounts payable to third parties in connection with claims subject to the indemnification provisions of Section 9.1"" suggests that there are specific indemnification obligations outlined in Section 9.1 of the agreement. This section likely details the circumstances under which one party must indemnify the other for third-party claims, which is directly related to the query about indemnification based on breaches of the agreement.

3. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause implies that indemnification is limited to specific scenarios (i.e., claims under Section 9.1 and breaches of confidentiality). This means that if a third-party claim arises due to a breach of the agreement (outside of the specified sections), the parties may not be liable for indemnification, thus defining the scope and limits of indemnification obligations.

4. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: By excluding liability for lost profits and consequential damages, the clause protects the parties from extensive financial repercussions that could arise from breaches, except in the context of indemnification for third-party claims. This delineation helps clarify the financial responsibilities of each party in the event of a breach.

In summary, this clause is crucial for understanding the framework of indemnification in the agreement, particularly how it relates to third-party claims and the limitations on liability for damages arising from breaches of the agreement. It sets the boundaries for what is indemnifiable and what types of damages are excluded, which is essential for assessing risk and liability in contractual relationships.",5

1. **Definition of Claim**: The clause begins by defining a ""Claim"" as any action or proceeding initiated by a third party, which is crucial for understanding the scope of indemnification. This definition establishes that the indemnification obligations apply to claims made by entities outside the parties involved in the agreement.

2. **Indemnity Obligations**: Section 7.2 specifies that each party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") is responsible for defending, indemnifying, and holding harmless the other party (the ""Indemnified Party"") from any claims arising from specific circumstances. These circumstances include:
   - The operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's site.
   - The marketing or sale of products or services through the Indemnifying Party's site.
   - Breaches of representations or warranties made by the Indemnifying Party.
   - Infringement of intellectual property rights by materials provided by the Indemnifying Party.

3. **Scope of Indemnification**: The indemnification covers costs, losses, damages, judgments, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, which are incurred as a result of the claims. This means that if a third party brings a claim against the Indemnified Party based on the actions or omissions of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party is obligated to cover the associated costs.

4. **Limitation on Liability**: Section 8.2 further clarifies that, except for claims awarded to a third party for which indemnification is provided, neither party will be liable for consequential damages. This limitation emphasizes that the indemnification is focused on direct claims and does not extend to indirect or consequential damages unless they arise from a third-party judgment.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it establishes the framework for indemnification related to third-party claims arising from breaches of the agreement. It outlines the responsibilities of each party in defending against such claims and the financial implications of those claims, thereby providing a clear mechanism for addressing potential breaches and their consequences.",5

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that it does not limit a Party's indemnification obligations. This means that if one party breaches the agreement and a third party makes a claim as a result of that breach, the indemnification obligations remain intact. The party that breached the agreement may still be required to indemnify the other party for any losses or damages incurred due to that third-party claim.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause limits the liability of the parties for certain types of damages (special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages) in the context of direct claims between the parties. However, it makes an exception for situations where such limitations would be contrary to applicable law or where damages have been awarded to a third party under a third-party claim. This indicates that while the parties may limit their liability to each other, they cannot limit their responsibility to indemnify for third-party claims that arise from breaches of the agreement.

3. **Third-Party Claims**: The reference to ""Third Party Claim"" in the clause suggests that if a third party successfully claims damages due to a breach of the agreement, the party responsible for the breach may be liable to indemnify the other party for those damages. This aligns with the general principle of indemnification, where one party agrees to compensate another for losses incurred due to the actions or failures of the indemnifying party.

In summary, this clause establishes a framework where indemnification obligations for third-party claims are preserved, even while limiting liability for certain types of damages in direct claims between the parties. This is crucial for understanding how breaches of the agreement can lead to third-party claims and the associated indemnification responsibilities.",5

Here's how the clause relates to the query:

1. **Assignment of Rights**: The clause states that the individual (or party) is assigning all their rights, title, and interest in existing and future IPRs to the Company. This is significant because, in the event of an IP infringement claim (whether related to trademarks or copyrights), the Company would hold the rights to defend against such claims and seek remedies.

2. **Scope of Protection**: The clause specifies that the assignment includes rights for the full term of protection, including extensions, revivals, and renewals. This ensures that the Company has comprehensive control over the IPRs, which is essential for enforcing its rights and defending against infringement claims.

3. **Right to Sue for Past Infringement**: The clause explicitly mentions the right to sue and claim remedies for past infringement. This is particularly relevant for indemnity because if the Company faces a claim of infringement based on the assigned IPRs, it can take legal action against infringers, thereby protecting its interests.

4. **Global Applicability**: The clause indicates that the assignment of rights applies in any and all countries of the world. This global scope is important for trademark and copyright protection, as infringement can occur in multiple jurisdictions, and the Company needs to be able to enforce its rights internationally.

It ensures that the Company has the necessary rights and authority to act in the event of an infringement, thereby fulfilling the purpose of an indemnity clause in protecting against IP-related liabilities.",5
IP infringement indemnity that covers trademark or copyright,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided addresses liability limitations between the parties in the context of intellectual property (IP) rights. Specifically, it states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages, except in cases where there is a claim or liability arising from the infringement of a third party's intellectual property rights.

Here's how this clause is relevant to your query about IP infringement indemnity that covers trademark or copyright:

1. **Exclusion of Liability**: The clause establishes a general limitation on liability for damages, which is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from extensive financial exposure. However, it makes an important exception for claims related to the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if one party's actions lead to a claim of IP infringement (such as trademark or copyright infringement), they cannot rely on this limitation to avoid liability.

2. **Indemnity Implications**: While the clause itself does not explicitly state an indemnity obligation, it implies that if a party's actions result in a claim of IP infringement, they may be responsible for any resulting damages. This aligns with the concept of indemnity, where one party agrees to compensate the other for certain losses or damages. In the context of IP infringement, this could mean that the party whose actions led to the infringement would need to indemnify the other party against any claims, costs, or damages arising from that infringement.

3. **Protection Against IP Claims**: By including this exception, the clause provides a level of protection for both parties against the risks associated with IP infringement. It acknowledges that IP rights are critical and that parties should be held accountable for any infringement that may occur as a result of their actions.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it highlights the importance of addressing liability in the context of IP infringement, specifically indicating that parties cannot escape liability for damages related to third-party IP claims, which is a key aspect of indemnity provisions in contracts.",5

The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict. If the Parties are able to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, the Parties will memorialize the agreed upon resolution in a written joint defense agreement signed by officers of each Party and their joint defense counsel. If the Parties are unable to resolve the actual or potential conflict of interest, each Party may independently and separately investigate, defend, settle and satisfy the claim subject to their right to pursue payment or reimbursement for costs incurred in doing so from the other Party as provided in this Agreement.","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations between the parties involved in the agreement. Indemnification generally refers to the responsibility of one party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") to compensate another party (the ""Indemnified Party"") for certain losses or damages that arise from specified claims or actions.

In the context of your query regarding whether indemnification covers indirect claims, the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect claims."" However, it does provide a broad definition of what constitutes an ""Indemnified Claim,"" which includes various types of claims, such as those arising from breaches of the agreement, negligence, and infringement of intellectual property.

Here are some key points from the clause that relate to your query:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the indemnification includes ""paying or reimbursing the actual, reasonable, substantiated out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the investigation, defense, and settlement"" of claims. This broad language suggests that the indemnification could potentially cover a wide range of claims, including those that may be considered indirect.

2. **Types of Claims Covered**: The clause lists specific scenarios where indemnification applies, such as third-party claims for personal injury, property damage, and violations of applicable law. While these examples primarily focus on direct claims, the language used does not explicitly limit the indemnification to only direct claims.

3. **Disputes Over Claims**: The clause also addresses potential disagreements between the parties regarding whether a claim qualifies as an ""Indemnified Claim."" This indicates that there may be room for interpretation regarding the nature of claims covered, which could include indirect claims depending on the circumstances.

4. **Good Faith and Cooperation**: The clause emphasizes the need for cooperation between the parties in the defense and settlement of claims. This collaborative approach may also extend to how indirect claims are handled, as the parties are encouraged to work together to resolve any disputes.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly state that indemnification covers indirect claims, its broad language and the nature of the obligations suggest that there may be potential for indirect claims to be included under the indemnification provisions, depending on the specific circumstances and interpretations of the parties involved.",4

### Key Points from the Clause:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause states that each party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party from any and all loss, damage, injury, or liability that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted by a third party. This includes claims for injury to or death of a person and loss of or damage to property.

2. **Direct and Indirect Claims**: The clause explicitly mentions that indemnification applies to losses resulting ""directly or indirectly"" from the indemnifying party's breach of duty, representation, or obligation under the agreement, or from its negligence or willful misconduct. This language indicates that both direct claims (those that arise directly from a breach or misconduct) and indirect claims (those that may arise as a consequence of a breach or misconduct) are covered under the indemnification provision.

3. **Claims Procedure**: The clause outlines a detailed procedure for how claims should be handled, including the requirement for the indemnified party (Indemnitee) to notify the indemnifying party of any claims and the process for defense and settlement. This procedural aspect ensures that both parties are aware of potential claims and can manage them appropriately.

### Conclusion:

The indemnification clause clearly encompasses both direct and indirect claims, as it specifies that losses resulting from the indemnifying party's actions or failures can be claimed for indemnification. Therefore, the clause is relevant to the query as it confirms that indemnification does indeed cover indirect claims, aligning with the language used in the clause.",5

Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The indemnification clause you provided outlines the obligations of each party to indemnify the other for claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses that arise from breaches of warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements made in the contract. 

In the context of your query regarding whether indemnification covers indirect claims, the clause does not explicitly mention ""indirect claims."" However, it does state that each party agrees to indemnify the other from ""any and all claims,"" which can be interpreted to include both direct and indirect claims, depending on the circumstances surrounding the claims.

Indirect claims typically refer to damages that are not a direct result of a party's actions but are instead a consequence of those actions, such as lost profits or consequential damages. The broad language of ""any and all claims"" suggests that the parties intended to cover a wide range of potential liabilities, which could encompass indirect claims as well.

To fully determine whether indirect claims are covered, one would need to consider the specific definitions of ""claims"" within the context of the entire agreement and any applicable legal interpretations. Additionally, the surrounding clauses and the intent of the parties at the time of drafting the agreement may provide further clarity on whether indirect claims are included in the indemnification obligations. 

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly state that it covers indirect claims, its broad language implies that it may include them, subject to further interpretation based on the overall agreement and applicable law.",5
indemnification covers indirect claims,a1f2e7f3dd,"12. Indemnification.

PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement.

The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim).","The indemnification clause you provided outlines the responsibilities of the parties (VS and PPD) to indemnify each other against claims made by third parties due to negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement. 

In the context of your query regarding whether indemnification covers indirect claims, it's important to clarify what is meant by ""indirect claims."" Indirect claims typically refer to claims that are not directly caused by the actions of a party but may arise as a consequence of those actions. For example, if a third party suffers damages due to a breach of contract, they may seek compensation not only for direct damages but also for consequential or indirect damages that result from that breach.

The clause specifically mentions that the indemnifying party (either VS or PPD) will indemnify the other for ""any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities"" incurred as a result of a ""Third Party Claim."" This broad language suggests that the indemnification could potentially cover indirect claims, as it does not limit the types of damages to only direct damages. 

However, the actual coverage of indirect claims would depend on the specific circumstances of the claim and the interpretation of the term ""damages"" within the context of the agreement. If the damages claimed by the third party are deemed to be indirect or consequential, it would be necessary to analyze whether such claims fall within the scope of indemnification as defined in this clause.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly state that it covers indirect claims, the broad language used suggests that it could encompass such claims, depending on the nature of the third-party claim and the interpretation of the terms used in the agreement.",5

In no event shall any party be responsible to the other for indirect, special or consequential damages.","The clause you provided under ""Indemnification"" explicitly states that ""Any and all claims, losses, cost or expenses shall be limited to actual and direct costs."" Furthermore, it specifies that ""In no event shall any party be responsible to the other for indirect, special or consequential damages."" 

This language is highly relevant to your query about whether indemnification covers indirect claims. The clause clearly indicates that indemnification is limited to direct costs and does not extend to indirect claims. Therefore, if a party were to seek indemnification for indirect, special, or consequential damages, the clause would preclude such claims from being covered under the indemnification provisions of the agreement.

In summary, the clause establishes a limitation on the scope of indemnification, explicitly excluding indirect claims, which directly answers your query.",5

This is directly relevant to the query regarding ""indemnification of first party claims"" for several reasons:

1. **Definition of Claims**: The clause defines a ""Claim"" as any action or proceeding instituted by a third party, which is crucial for understanding the scope of indemnification. It clarifies that the indemnification applies to claims made by entities that are not affiliated with either party, thus focusing on external claims rather than internal disputes.

2. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause specifies the circumstances under which the Indemnifying Party is responsible for indemnifying the Indemnified Party. This includes claims arising from the operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's site, breaches of representations or warranties, and infringement of intellectual property rights. This delineation is important for determining liability and the extent of protection offered to the Indemnified Party.

3. **Exclusions and Limitations**: The clause also includes a provision (Section 8.2) that limits liability for consequential damages, except in cases where a third party has been awarded damages against a party that is entitled to indemnification. This means that while the parties are protected from certain types of damages, they still have a pathway to recover costs if a third party successfully claims damages against them, reinforcing the importance of the indemnification clause.

4. **Procedural Aspects**: The clause mentions that the Indemnifying Party will pay any awards and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of such claims, which is a critical aspect of indemnification. It ensures that the Indemnified Party is not left bearing the financial burden of defending against claims that are the responsibility of the Indemnifying Party.

4. **Exclusions and Limitations**: The clause also outlines specific exclusions, such as claims related to items or materials supplied by the Indemnified Party. This is important for understanding the limitations of indemnification and clarifying the responsibilities of each party.

This establishes a clear framework for how each party will protect the other from claims made by external parties.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The indemnification is specifically tied to claims arising from negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of the agreement by the indemnifying party. This means that if either party's actions lead to a third-party claim, they are responsible for covering the associated costs and liabilities.

3. **Notice and Control of Defense**: The clause requires the indemnified party to promptly notify the indemnifying party of any third-party claims. It also grants the indemnifying party the right to control the defense and settlement of such claims, provided they act reasonably and in good faith. This is important for managing legal risks and ensuring that the defense is handled effectively.

4. **Participation Rights**: The indemnified party retains the right to participate in the defense of the claim, which allows them to protect their interests even if they are not controlling the defense. This is crucial for ensuring that both parties are aligned in their approach to handling claims.

5. **First Party Claims Context**: While the clause specifically addresses third-party claims, it indirectly relates to first-party claims by establishing the responsibilities and protections each party has in the event of claims arising from their own actions. If a first-party claim were to arise (e.g., a breach of contract claim between the two parties), the indemnification obligations could still be relevant in determining liability and defense responsibilities.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to the query as it outlines the responsibilities of each party in relation to third-party claims, which can inform how first-party claims might be managed in terms of liability and defense obligations.",4

Subject to Section 7.3 [Procedure], the Indemnifying Party will pay any award against the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates (and their respective employees, directors or representatives) and any costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by them resulting from any such Claim.","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations of the parties involved in the agreement, specifically detailing how one party (the ""Indemnifying Party"") is responsible for defending, indemnifying, and holding harmless the other party (the ""Indemnified Party"") from various claims. This directly relates to the query regarding ""indemnification of first party claims"" in the following ways:

1. **Definition of Claims**: The clause defines a ""Claim"" as any action or proceeding instituted by a third party, which is crucial for understanding the scope of indemnification. While the query mentions ""first party claims,"" the clause primarily addresses third-party claims, which are typically the focus of indemnification provisions.

2. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause specifies the circumstances under which the Indemnifying Party must indemnify the Indemnified Party. This includes claims arising from the operation or content of the Indemnifying Party's site, breaches of representations or warranties, and infringement of intellectual property rights. This establishes a clear framework for when indemnification is triggered, which is essential for understanding the obligations of the parties.

3. **Defense and Costs**: The clause obligates the Indemnifying Party to defend the Indemnified Party against claims and to cover associated costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees. This is a critical aspect of indemnification, as it ensures that the Indemnified Party is protected from financial burdens resulting from claims that are not their fault.

4. **Limitations and Exclusions**: The clause also includes specific exclusions, such as claims related to items or materials supplied by the Indemnified Party. This delineation is important for understanding the limits of indemnification and the responsibilities of each party.

5. **Procedural Requirements**: The clause references a procedural section (Section 7.3) that likely outlines the steps the Indemnified Party must take to invoke indemnification. This procedural aspect is vital for ensuring that claims are handled appropriately and that the indemnification process is followed.

In summary, while the clause primarily addresses third-party claims, it establishes the framework for indemnification that is relevant to the query about first-party claims by outlining the responsibilities of the Indemnifying Party, the scope of indemnification, and the procedural requirements for invoking such protections. Understanding these elements is crucial for assessing the overall risk and liability management in the context of the agreement.",3

2. Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.","The clause provided is directly relevant to your query about indemnification clauses that include ""hold harmless"" provisions. Here's how it connects:

1. **Indemnification and Hold Harmless**: The clause explicitly states that the parties (MICOA and Agency) shall ""indemnify and hold one another harmless."" This phrase is a common legal term used in contracts to indicate that one party agrees to protect the other from certain losses or damages. The inclusion of ""hold harmless"" reinforces the indemnification obligation, indicating that the indemnifying party will not only compensate for losses but also ensure that the other party is not held liable for those losses.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause outlines specific scenarios under which each party must indemnify the other. For example, MICOA is required to indemnify the Agency for any acts or omissions by MICOA, except when the Agency has contributed to the error. Similarly, the Agency must indemnify MICOA for its own acts or omissions, with the same exception. This reciprocal nature of indemnification is a key aspect of many contracts, ensuring that both parties are protected from liabilities arising from their own actions.

3. **Legal Protection**: By including such indemnification and hold harmless provisions, the parties are establishing a framework for legal protection against potential claims or damages that may arise during the course of their relationship. This is particularly important in contractual agreements where risks are inherent.

Here's how it is relevant to your query:

1. **Indemnification Definition**: The clause begins by defining the roles of the parties involved, identifying one as the ""Indemnifying Party"" and the other as the ""Indemnified Party."" This sets the stage for the indemnification relationship, where one party agrees to protect the other from certain liabilities.

2. **Hold Harmless Language**: The phrase ""hold harmless"" is explicitly included in the clause. This term is commonly used in legal agreements to indicate that one party agrees not to hold the other party responsible for certain claims or damages. In this context, it means that the Indemnifying Party will not only indemnify the Indemnified Party but also ensure that the Indemnified Party is not held liable for the specified claims.

3. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause outlines the scope of indemnification, specifying that the Indemnifying Party will defend the Indemnified Party against a wide range of claims, including those arising from negligence, breaches of contract, violations of laws, and intellectual property infringements. This comprehensive coverage is typical in indemnification clauses to protect the Indemnified Party from various risks associated with the agreement.

4. **Direct Causation**: The clause specifies that the indemnification applies to claims that are ""caused directly by acts or omissions of the Indemnifying Party."" This establishes a direct link between the actions of the Indemnifying Party and the liabilities incurred by the Indemnified Party, which is a critical aspect of indemnification agreements.

5. **Legal Protection**: By including both indemnification and hold harmless provisions, the clause provides legal protection to the Indemnified Party, ensuring that they are shielded from financial losses and legal repercussions that may arise from the Indemnifying Party's actions or failures.

3. **Risk Allocation**: The exclusion of consequential, punitive, special, or similar damages indicates a risk allocation strategy, which is often a key component of both indemnification and hold harmless clauses. By limiting liability, the parties are effectively agreeing on how risks will be managed and who will bear the financial consequences of certain events.

3. **Scope of Indemnity**: The clause outlines specific scenarios under which the Indemnitor is responsible for indemnifying the Indemnitee, such as breaches of the agreement, personal injury, property damage, and intellectual property infringement.

4. **Exclusions**: The clause also includes a limitation on liability, stating that neither party will be liable for certain types of damages (indirect, special, etc.) except for claims made under the indemnification section. This is important as it sets boundaries on the indemnification obligations and protects the Indemnitor from excessive liability.

ARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY","The clause you provided, particularly Section 11.4, addresses the limitation of liability between the parties involved in the agreement. While it does not explicitly mention ""indemnification"" or ""hold harmless,"" it is relevant to the query regarding indemnification clauses that include hold harmless provisions in the following ways:

1. **Indemnification Rights**: The clause explicitly states that the limitations on liability do not affect the indemnification rights or obligations of the parties under Sections 11.1 and 11.2. This implies that the parties have agreed to indemnify each other for certain liabilities, which is a key component of hold harmless agreements. Indemnification typically involves one party agreeing to compensate another for certain damages or losses, which aligns with the concept of holding someone harmless from liability.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause limits the types of damages for which one party can be held liable to the other, specifically excluding lost profits and special, consequential, incidental, or indirect damages. However, it clarifies that this limitation does not apply to indemnification obligations. This distinction is important because it indicates that indemnification (and potentially hold harmless) obligations are treated separately and are not subject to the same limitations as other types of damages.

3. **Context of Indemnification**: The mention of indemnification in the context of confidentiality obligations under Article 12 suggests that the parties are aware of the need to protect each other from certain risks and liabilities, which is a fundamental aspect of hold harmless agreements.

Your query specifically asks for indemnification clauses that do not include ""hold harmless."" 

To address your query, we can analyze the structure and intent of indemnification clauses that do not use the term ""hold harmless."" An indemnification clause typically serves to allocate risk between parties by requiring one party to compensate the other for certain losses or damages that may arise from specified actions or omissions.

Here’s how an indemnification clause without ""hold harmless"" might be structured:

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause would state that one party agrees to indemnify the other for specific claims, losses, or damages arising from their actions or omissions.
   
2. **Scope of Indemnity**: It would outline the circumstances under which indemnification applies, such as negligence, breach of contract, or other specified events.

3. **Exclusions**: The clause would also specify any limitations or exclusions, such as situations where the indemnified party's own actions contributed to the loss.

For example, a revised indemnification clause without ""hold harmless"" could look like this:

``` 
G. INDEMNIFICATION
The respective parties shall indemnify one another as follows:
1. MICOA shall indemnify Agency against any claims, losses, or damages arising from MICOA's acts or omissions, except to the extent that Agency has caused or contributed to such claims, losses, or damages.
2. Agency shall indemnify MICOA against any claims, losses, or damages arising from Agency's acts or omissions, except to the extent that MICOA has caused or contributed to such claims, losses, or damages.

### Relevance to Your Query:
1. **Indemnification Purpose**: The clause still serves the purpose of indemnification, which is to protect the Indemnified Party from certain liabilities or claims arising from the actions of the Indemnifying Party.
  
2. **Legal Language**: The absence of ""hold harmless"" does not diminish the legal effect of the indemnification; it simply changes the wording. The clause can still effectively allocate risk and responsibility between the parties.

3. **Customization**: Parties may choose to omit ""hold harmless"" for various reasons, such as preference for simpler language or to align with specific legal standards or practices in their jurisdiction.

Instead, they are focusing on the types of damages that are excluded from indemnification. This aligns with your request for indemnification clauses that do not include ""hold harmless,"" as it demonstrates a different approach to limiting liability without using that specific terminology.

2. **Absence of ""Hold Harmless""**: While the clause includes the term ""indemnify,"" it does not use the phrase ""hold harmless.""

1. **Defense of Claims**: The clause states that the Indemnitor will ""defend"" the Indemnitee against any claims, suits, actions, demands, or proceedings.

4. **Notification and Cooperation**: The clause requires the indemnified party to promptly notify the indemnifying party of any claims and provide full information and assistance. This ensures that the indemnifying party can effectively manage the defense, which is essential for the indemnification process.

2. **Defense of Claims**: The clause specifies that the indemnifying party has the right to control the defense of any claims (referred to as ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a loss.

3. **Claims Procedure**: The clause details the procedure that must be followed when a claim arises, including the requirement for the Indemnitee to provide notice of the claim (Claims Notice) and the timelines for the indemnifying party to respond. This procedural aspect is important in indemnification agreements, as it ensures that both parties are aware of their rights and obligations when a claim is made.

4. **Control and Cooperation**: The clause allows the indemnifying party to select its own counsel and manage the defense, while also requiring the Indemnitee to cooperate in the defense process.

10.1 Indemnification. Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their
respective employees, directors, officers, agents and successors (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all losses (including all costs,
liabilities (including present and future damages), claims and expenses) incurred or suffered by any of the Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising
out of, relating to or resulting from (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement; or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement.","The provided indemnification clause outlines the responsibilities of the ""Indemnifying Party"" to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the ""Indemnified Parties"" from various losses and claims. However, it does not explicitly grant the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense of any claims or lawsuits that may arise.

To align the clause with your query regarding the control of defenses by the indemnifying party, you would need to modify the clause to include language that explicitly states that the Indemnifying Party has the right to control the defense of any claims or actions for which they are providing indemnification.

10. INDEMNIFICATION
10.1 Indemnification. Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their respective employees, directors, officers, agents, and successors (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all losses (including all costs, liabilities (including present and future damages), claims, and expenses) incurred or suffered by any of the Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising out of, relating to, or resulting from (a) a breach by the Indemnifying Party of this Agreement; or (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement. 

10.2 Control of Defense. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control the defense of any claim or action for which indemnification is provided under this Section 10, including the selection of legal counsel, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such claim or action without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

### Explanation of Relevance

1. **Indemnification Responsibility**: The original clause establishes the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for losses arising from breaches or misconduct. This is foundational to any indemnification agreement.

2. **Control of Defense**: By adding a section that explicitly grants the Indemnifying Party the right to control the defense, you address the query directly. This allows the Indemnifying Party to manage how claims are defended, which can be crucial for strategic reasons, such as minimizing liability or managing public relations.

3. **Settlement Authority**: Including a provision that requires the Indemnifying Party to obtain consent before settling claims ensures that the interests of the Indemnified Parties are protected, while still allowing the Indemnifying Party to control the defense.

In summary, the original clause provides a basis for indemnification, but to fully meet the query's requirement, it needs to be expanded to include the right of the Indemnifying Party to control the defense of claims.",5
Indemnity of broad-based claims,e5e8ffdb8f,"Section 10. Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys' fees) in connection therewith.","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations of the parties involved in the agreement. It is relevant to the query regarding ""indemnity of broad-based claims"" in several ways:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that each party agrees to indemnify the other for ""any and all claims, causes of action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses"" that arise from inconsistencies with the warranties, representations, covenants, or agreements made in the contract. This broad language indicates that the indemnity covers a wide range of potential claims, which aligns with the concept of ""broad-based claims.""

2. **Protection Against Claims**: The indemnification clause serves to protect each party from various claims that may arise during the performance of the agreement. This is particularly important in commercial contracts where parties may face numerous risks and liabilities. The broad nature of the indemnity ensures that both parties are safeguarded against a wide array of potential legal issues.

3. **Legal Costs and Expenses**: The clause explicitly includes coverage for legal costs and attorneys' fees, which is a critical aspect of indemnification. This means that if one party faces a claim that falls under the indemnity provisions, they can recover not only damages but also the costs associated with defending against such claims. This further emphasizes the broad protection offered by the indemnity.

4. **Right to Withhold Payment**: The clause also provides the non-indemnifying party the right to withhold payment pending the resolution of any claims. This mechanism allows the non-indemnifying party to mitigate potential losses while a claim is being resolved, reinforcing the protective nature of the indemnity.

In summary, the indemnification clause is directly relevant to the query about broad-based claims as it establishes a comprehensive framework for addressing a wide range of potential legal issues that may arise from the agreement, thereby providing significant protection to both parties involved.",5
Indemnity of broad-based claims,596576fcc8,"Section 5.04 Limitations. The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under this Agreement shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall […***…] for such claims until the […***…] of the […***…] shall […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the […***…] of the [… ***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…], and (ii) the Indemnifying Party's […***…] for [… ***…] shall not […***…] of the […***…] by the […***…] of all of the […***…] and […***…] of […***…]. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 5.04, the limitations provided in this Section 5.04 shall not apply to (i) any claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (ii) any claim for breach of any agreement or covenant contained herein.","The clause you provided, Section 5.04 Limitations, is relevant to the query regarding ""indemnity of broad-based claims"" as it outlines the limitations on the liability of the Indemnifying Party for claims made under the Agreement. Here’s how it connects to the concept of indemnity and broad-based claims:

1. **Indemnifying Party's Liability**: The clause specifies that the liability of the Indemnifying Party is subject to certain limitations. This is crucial in indemnity agreements, where one party agrees to compensate another for certain damages or losses. The limitations set forth in this clause help define the scope of indemnity and the circumstances under which the Indemnifying Party will be held liable.

2. **Conditions for Claims**: The clause indicates that the Indemnifying Party's liability is contingent upon specific conditions being met (e.g., the occurrence of certain events or thresholds). This is important in indemnity contexts, as it clarifies the circumstances under which indemnity will be triggered and the extent of that indemnity.

3. **Exclusions from Limitations**: The clause explicitly states that certain claims, such as those for fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or breach of agreement, are not subject to the limitations outlined. This is significant because it highlights that broad-based claims, particularly those involving serious misconduct or breaches of fundamental obligations, will not be limited by the provisions of this section. This ensures that parties can seek full recourse for serious violations, which is a key aspect of indemnity agreements.

4. **Protection Against Irreparable Damage**: The external information provided emphasizes the concept of irreparable damage and the right to seek equitable relief (such as injunctions) in the event of a breach. This aligns with the indemnity clause, as it underscores the importance of protecting parties from significant harm that may not be adequately addressed through monetary damages alone.

In summary, Section 5.04 is relevant to the query as it delineates the limitations on indemnity claims, specifies conditions under which indemnity applies, and identifies exceptions for serious claims, thereby framing the overall indemnity structure within the Agreement.",5

Here’s how the clause relates to the concept of indemnity and broad-based claims:

1. **Indemnity Definition**: The clause specifies that Berkshire shall indemnify and hold Auriemma harmless from ""any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, damages and expenses."" This broad language indicates that the indemnity covers a wide range of potential claims, which aligns with the notion of ""broad-based claims.""

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: The indemnity extends to claims arising from ""any inaccuracy or breach of Berkshire's representations, warranties, covenants,"" as well as claims related to gross negligence. This broad scope ensures that Auriemma is protected from various types of claims that may arise in connection with the Agreement, reinforcing the idea of comprehensive indemnity.

3. **Prompt Notice Requirement**: The clause also includes a requirement for Berkshire to be given prompt notice of any claims or actions. This is a common provision in indemnity clauses, as it allows the indemnifying party (Berkshire) to respond appropriately to claims and manage potential liabilities.

4. **Legal and Financial Protection**: By including indemnity for claims related to breaches and inaccuracies, the clause provides Auriemma with legal and financial protection against potential losses that could arise from Berkshire's actions or failures under the Agreement.

In summary, this indemnity clause is relevant to the query as it exemplifies how indemnity can be structured to cover a wide array of claims, thereby providing broad protection to the indemnified party (Auriemma) against various risks associated with the Agreement.",5
Indemnity of broad-based claims,6a700c0c62,"EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9 WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ENHANCED DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR CLAIM HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF (A) WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE, (B) WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND (C) THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.","The clause you provided addresses the limitations of liability between the parties in the context of breaches of the agreement. Specifically, it states that, except for indemnification obligations related to claims by third parties, neither party will be liable for certain types of damages, including consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or enhanced damages, as well as lost profits or revenues.

This clause is relevant to the query about ""indemnity of broad-based claims"" in the following ways:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause explicitly carves out an exception for indemnification obligations related to claims by third parties. This means that while the parties agree to limit their liability for certain types of damages, they still have a responsibility to indemnify each other for claims made by third parties. This is significant because it indicates that the parties recognize the potential for broader claims that may arise from third-party actions, which could include a variety of damages that are not limited by the clause.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause serves to protect both parties from extensive liability for indirect or consequential damages that could arise from breaches of the agreement. This limitation is important in the context of indemnity because it helps define the boundaries of what each party can claim in terms of damages, except in cases where third-party claims are involved.

3. **Legal and Equitable Theories**: The clause also notes that the limitation applies regardless of the legal or equitable theory upon which a claim is based. This broadens the scope of the limitation and reinforces the idea that the parties are seeking to limit their exposure to liability, except in the specific context of third-party indemnification.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it outlines the limitations on liability for breaches of the agreement while simultaneously acknowledging the need for indemnification in the case of third-party claims, which can encompass a wider range of potential damages. This distinction is crucial for understanding the overall risk management and liability framework established in the agreement.",5

The Indemnifying Party must act in good faith in exercising control over the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim. (3) Provide information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party regarding the investigation, defense, settlement and satisfaction of the Indemnified Claim f.

The Parties may disagree on whether a claim is an Indemnified Claim under this Agreement, which Party should be considered the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party for an Indemnified Claim or whether each Party is partially liable for an Indemnified Claim and how liability for such an Indemnified Claim should be allocated between them. In these and other circumstances in which an actual or potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the Parties with regards to an alleged or agreed upon Indemnified Claim that would preclude their joint representation by a single defense counsel, the Parties will endeavor in good faith to attempt to resolve the conflict.

1. **Definition of Indemnified Claims**: The clause defines what constitutes an ""Indemnified Claim,"" which includes a wide range of claims such as civil, criminal, or administrative actions against the Indemnified Party. This broad definition indicates that the indemnity covers various potential claims that could arise from the parties' actions or breaches of the agreement.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the indemnification includes not only the payment of damages but also the reimbursement of expenses incurred in the defense of such claims. This broad scope ensures that the Indemnified Party is protected from a wide array of potential liabilities, which aligns with the concept of broad-based indemnity.

3. **Specific Indemnification Obligations**: The clause outlines specific scenarios in which each party must indemnify the other, such as breaches of the agreement, negligence, and third-party claims related to personal injury or property damage. This specificity further emphasizes the broad nature of the indemnity, as it covers various types of claims that could arise from different circumstances.

4. **Conditions for Indemnification**: The clause sets forth conditions that the Indemnified Party must meet to receive indemnification, such as promptly notifying the Indemnifying Party of a claim and cooperating in the defense. This ensures that the indemnity process is structured and that both parties are engaged in managing claims effectively.

5. **Conflict of Interest Resolution**: The clause also addresses potential conflicts of interest that may arise in the context of indemnified claims, indicating that the parties will work in good faith to resolve such conflicts. This aspect is important in the context of broad-based claims, as it ensures that both parties can navigate complex situations without compromising their rights or interests.

Overall, the indemnification clause is relevant to the query as it establishes a comprehensive framework for how the parties will handle a wide range of claims, ensuring that both parties are protected and have clear obligations regarding indemnification.

It specifically mentions that ""Party B and its affiliates will be the exclusive cooperator of Party A's real estate and home furnishing cooperation channel.""

In the context of indemnification, if Party B is indemnified under the agreement, it is reasonable to interpret that this indemnification extends to its affiliates as well, given that they are explicitly mentioned as part of the cooperation arrangement. This means that if any claims arise related to the cooperation channel, both Party B and its affiliates would be protected under the indemnification provisions of the agreement.

Thus, the clause supports the notion that the indemnified party includes affiliates, as it explicitly states that Party B's affiliates are part of the cooperative relationship and, by extension, could be included in any indemnification obligations.",5

This means that any claims, costs, losses, damages, or expenses that the Indemnified Party or its affiliates incur can be covered under the indemnity provisions.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause outlines that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for defending, indemnifying, and holding harmless the Indemnified Party and its affiliates from any claims arising from specified circumstances. This reinforces the inclusion of affiliates in the indemnification process.

3. **Scope of Claims**: The clause specifies that the indemnification applies to claims arising from various actions or breaches related to the Indemnifying Party's operations, which further emphasizes the protection extended to both the Indemnified Party and its affiliates.

Here's how it connects:

1. **Assignment of Rights and Obligations**: The clause states that a party cannot assign its rights and obligations under the agreement without the prior written consent of all other parties. However, it makes an exception for assignments to affiliates, provided that the performance of the affiliate is guaranteed satisfactorily by the assigning party.

2. **Inclusion of Affiliates**: By allowing a party to assign its rights and obligations to its affiliates (with the condition of satisfactory performance guarantees), the clause implicitly recognizes that affiliates can be included in the scope of the agreement. This suggests that affiliates can be considered as part of the indemnified party, as they can inherit rights and obligations under the agreement.

3. **Exclusions from Limitations**: Importantly, the clause states that certain types of claims, such as those for fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or breach of agreement, are exempt from these limitations. This is significant because it highlights that while the indemnification may be limited for general claims, it remains robust for serious breaches or misconduct, which could be considered broad-based claims.

4. **Legal Framework**: The context of the clause aligns with the legal principles of indemnification, where parties often negotiate the extent of liability and the types of claims that are covered.

This procedural aspect is crucial for ensuring that the indemnification process is followed correctly and that both parties understand their responsibilities.

4. **Legal and Financial Protection**: By including this indemnification clause, the parties are establishing a legal framework that protects Excite@Home from potential financial liabilities arising from third-party claims related to the Application Provider's actions. This is a common practice in contracts to allocate risk and ensure that one party is responsible for certain liabilities.

5. **Relevance to Broader Claims**: The mention of various types of claims (e.g., intellectual property, publicity, privacy rights) suggests that the indemnification is designed to cover a broad spectrum of potential legal issues that could arise from the Application Provider's operations, thus aligning with the concept of broad-based third-party claims.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it explicitly addresses the indemnification of third-party claims, outlines the scope and limitations of that indemnification, and provides a framework for legal and financial protection for the indemnified party.",5

An Indemnitor shall have no liability under this Article unless the Indemnitee gives notice of such claim to the Indemnitor promptly after the Indemnitee learns of such claim so as to not prejudice the Indemnitor. Under no circumstance shall either party hereto settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any claim, suit, proceeding, or action that is the subject of indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably.","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations between two parties, specifically focusing on how each party (Network Affiliate and NCM) will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other from third-party claims. This is directly relevant to the query regarding ""indemnification of broad-based third-party claims"" for several reasons:

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that both parties are responsible for indemnifying each other against ""any and all losses, obligations, risks, costs, liabilities, settlements, damages, judgments, awards, fines, penalties, and expenses"" arising from third-party claims. This broad language indicates that the indemnification covers a wide range of potential claims, which aligns with the concept of ""broad-based"" indemnification.

2. **Types of Claims Covered**: The clause details specific scenarios under which indemnification is applicable, such as breaches of the agreement, infringement of intellectual property rights, and instances of fraud or willful misconduct. This specificity helps clarify the types of third-party claims that would trigger indemnification, ensuring that both parties understand their responsibilities.

3. **Control of Defense**: Section 10.4 discusses the rights of the indemnifying party (Indemnitor) to control the defense and settlement of claims. This is a critical aspect of indemnification, as it allows the Indemnitor to manage the legal strategy and costs associated with defending against third-party claims, which is essential in broad-based indemnification scenarios.

4. **Notice Requirement**: The clause includes a requirement for the Indemnitee to promptly notify the Indemnitor of any claims. This is important for ensuring that the Indemnitor can respond effectively to third-party claims, which is a key component of effective indemnification.

5. **Limitations and Exclusions**: The clause also outlines certain limitations on indemnification, particularly in Section 10.3(c), which specifies circumstances under which NCM would not be liable for infringement claims. This is relevant to understanding the boundaries of indemnification and the conditions under which it applies.

Overall, this indemnification clause is comprehensive and addresses the key elements of indemnification for broad-based third-party claims, including the obligations of each party, the types of claims covered, the process for handling claims, and the limitations of those obligations.",5

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause outlines the indemnification responsibilities of both parties (BLI and Ginkgo) in the event of claims brought by third parties. Specifically, it states that each party will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party and its affiliates from any claims and associated losses that arise from various causes, including fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: 
   - **Section 12.1** specifies that BLI will indemnify Ginkgo for claims arising from BLI's breach of the agreement, material inaccuracies in representations or warranties, and negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct by BLI or its affiliates. This means that if a third party brings a claim against Ginkgo due to BLI's fraudulent or negligent actions, BLI is responsible for covering the associated costs and damages.
   - **Section 12.2** similarly outlines Ginkgo's indemnification obligations to BLI for claims arising from Ginkgo's breach of the agreement or its own negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.

3. **Legal Expenses and Losses**: The clause also specifies that the indemnifying party is responsible for all associated damages, liabilities, expenses, and losses, including reasonable legal expenses and attorneys' fees. This is crucial in the context of third-party claims, as it ensures that the indemnified party does not bear the financial burden of defending against such claims.

4. **Exclusions from Liability Limitations**: The clause also references that certain types of claims, including those arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, are excluded from liability limitations. This means that if a party engages in such conduct, they cannot limit their liability for the resulting claims, reinforcing the importance of accountability in cases of serious misconduct.

5. **Third-Party Claims**: The term ""Claims"" is defined to include suits, claims, proceedings, and causes of action brought by third parties. This directly addresses the query about third-party claims and indicates that the indemnification provisions are designed to protect each party from the consequences of such claims arising from the other party's actions.

In summary, the clause establishes a framework for indemnification related to third-party claims arising from fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, ensuring that the parties are protected from the financial repercussions of such claims and clarifying their respective responsibilities in these situations.",5

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause outlines the indemnification responsibilities of both parties (BLI and Ginkgo) in the event of claims brought by third parties. Specifically, it states that each party will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party and its affiliates from any claims and associated losses that arise from certain actions, including negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: 
   - **Section 12.1 (Indemnification by BLI)**: This section specifies that BLI will indemnify Ginkgo and its affiliates for claims arising from BLI's breach of the agreement or any negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct by BLI or its representatives. This directly addresses the query about indemnity related to fraud and negligence.
   - **Section 12.2 (Indemnification by Ginkgo)**: Similarly, this section states that Ginkgo will indemnify BLI and its affiliates for claims arising from Ginkgo's breach of the agreement or any negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct by Ginkgo or its representatives. This further reinforces the mutual indemnification obligations concerning third-party claims.

3. **Exclusions and Limitations**: The clause also includes provisions that limit liability for consequential damages and sets forth specific exceptions where these limitations do not apply, such as in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This is important because it clarifies that even if there are limitations on liability, claims arising from these serious breaches are not subject to those limitations, thus ensuring that parties can seek full recovery for such claims.

4. **Legal Expenses**: The clause mentions that indemnification includes reasonable legal expenses and attorneys' fees, which is crucial in the context of defending against third-party claims. This means that if a third party brings a claim based on fraud or negligence, the indemnifying party is responsible for covering the legal costs associated with that claim.

In summary, the clause provides a clear framework for how each party will handle third-party claims related to fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, ensuring that they are protected from liabilities arising from such claims and establishing the responsibilities for legal defense and associated costs.",5

1. **Exclusion of Consequential Damages**: Section 11.6 states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, including lost profits or indirect damages. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if a third party makes a claim against one of the parties due to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the affected party can seek indemnification and may not be limited by the consequential damages exclusion.

2. **Liability Limitations**: Section 11.7 outlines the limitations on liability for claims arising out of the agreement. It specifies that the aggregate liability of a party will not exceed a certain amount, but again, there are exceptions. Notably, the limitations do not apply to claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, as well as indemnification obligations. This indicates that if a third party claims damages due to such actions, the liable party may face full liability without the limitations typically imposed by the agreement.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause references Article 12, which pertains to indemnification. This is particularly relevant because it suggests that if a party is found liable for fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, they may have an obligation to indemnify the other party for any losses incurred as a result of third-party claims related to those actions.

In summary, the clause establishes that while there are limitations on liability and exclusions for consequential damages, claims involving fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct are treated differently. This is crucial for understanding how indemnity would work in the context of third-party claims, as it allows for full recovery and liability in such cases, ensuring that parties are held accountable for serious breaches of conduct.",5

Here's how it relates to your query about third-party claim indemnity in the context of fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct:

1. **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**: The clause explicitly states that obligations to indemnify a party for claims made by third parties are exceptions to the general limitation of liability. This means that if a third party brings a claim against one of the parties (or their affiliates) related to the agreement, the indemnifying party may still be liable for damages, even if those damages would typically be excluded under the agreement.

2. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: The clause limits liability for consequential, incidental, indirect, or special damages, as well as punitive damages, arising from the agreement. However, this limitation does not apply to indemnification obligations for third-party claims. Therefore, if a third party alleges fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, the party responsible for indemnifying against such claims may still be liable for those specific damages, regardless of the general limitations outlined in the clause.

3. **Implications for Fraud, Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: If a third party claims that one of the parties engaged in fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, the indemnification obligations would come into play. The clause suggests that the party being indemnified may seek compensation for losses incurred due to the third-party claim, even if those losses would typically be categorized as consequential or indirect.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it clarifies that while the parties may limit their liability for certain types of damages, they still have an obligation to indemnify each other for third-party claims, including those arising from allegations of fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct. This creates a safeguard for the parties against potential liabilities that could arise from the actions or omissions of the other party in relation to third parties.",5

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable to the other for certain types of damages (special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory, or punitive damages) in the event of a breach of the agreement. This limitation is significant because it sets the boundaries for liability, which can impact how indemnity claims are handled, especially in the context of third-party claims.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not limit a party's indemnification obligations. This is crucial because it implies that if one party is required to indemnify the other for a third-party claim (which could arise from fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct), the indemnifying party cannot rely on the limitation of liability to escape responsibility for those claims. 

3. **Third Party Claims**: The clause mentions that the limitation of liability does not apply to damages awarded to a third party under a third-party claim. This means that if a third party successfully claims damages against one of the parties due to actions that could involve fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, the party may still be liable for those damages, regardless of the limitations set forth in the agreement.

4. **Implications for Fraud, Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: In the context of your query, if a third-party claim arises due to fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct, the indemnification obligations would still apply, and the party responsible for the misconduct may be required to indemnify the other party for any damages awarded to the third party. The limitation of liability clause does not protect the party from these specific types of claims, which is a critical consideration in drafting and negotiating indemnity provisions.

In summary, this clause is relevant because it clarifies the extent of liability and indemnification obligations in the context of third-party claims, particularly those arising from serious misconduct such as fraud or negligence. It ensures that parties cannot escape their indemnification responsibilities by invoking limitations on liability when it comes to third-party claims.",5

Here's how it relates to your query about third-party claim indemnity limited to the use of products in compliance with the agreement:

1. **Accuray Indemnity (Section 10.1)**: This section specifies that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor against third-party claims that a product infringes on intellectual property rights (patents, copyrights, trade secrets). The indemnity is contingent upon the Distributor providing prompt notice, allowing Accuray to control the defense, and assisting Accuray in the process. This indicates that the indemnity is tied to the legal standing of the product as it is provided under the agreement.

2. **Products Liability Indemnity (Section 10.2)**: This section further emphasizes that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor for claims that a product is unsafe when used according to Accuray's written specifications.

The indemnity is contingent upon the Distributor providing prompt notice, allowing Accuray to control the defense, and assisting Accuray in the process. This indicates that the indemnity is tied to the legal standing of the product as provided by Accuray, which implies that the use of the product must be in accordance with the agreement.

2. **Products Liability Indemnity (Section 10.2)**: This section further emphasizes that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor for claims that a product is unsafe when used according to Accuray's written specifications for its intended use. This clearly limits the indemnity to situations where the product is used as specified in the agreement, reinforcing the idea that compliance with the agreement is a prerequisite for indemnity.

3. **Distributor Indemnity (Section 10.6)**: Conversely, this section outlines the Distributor's obligation to indemnify Accuray for claims arising from the Distributor's acts or omissions that are not in accordance with the agreement. This establishes that if the Distributor fails to comply with the terms of the agreement, they may be liable for third-party claims, thus limiting the indemnity protection for the Distributor.

4. **Liability Cap (Section 11.3)**: This section caps the liability of either party for claims related to breaches of the agreement, which includes third-party claims. It limits the total aggregate liability to the amount paid by the Distributor for products in the twelve months preceding the claim notification. This cap further emphasizes that the indemnity and liability are closely tied to the financial transactions and compliance with the agreement.

In summary, the indemnity clauses in the contract are directly relevant to your query as they establish the conditions under which each party will indemnify the other for third-party claims, specifically linking the indemnity to the proper use of products in compliance with the agreement.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: The indemnity provided by the Suppliers (Section 8.1) is specifically limited to claims arising from:
   - Allegations that a product infringes or misappropriates intellectual property rights.
   - Claims arising from manufacturing defects under products liability theory.

   Importantly, the indemnity does not cover claims that arise from:
   - Modifications made to the product by parties other than the Supplier.
   - The combination or use of the product with other products, processes, or materials not approved by the Supplier.

3. **Company's Indemnification**: Similarly, the Company’s indemnification obligations (Section 8.2) are also limited to claims not covered by the Suppliers' indemnity. The Company is responsible for claims arising from the same types of allegations but is also limited in its indemnity based on modifications or combinations of the product not approved by the Company.

4. **Compliance with Agreement**: The clause implicitly reinforces the idea that indemnity is tied to compliance with the terms of the agreement.

2. **Types of Claims Covered**: The clause includes specific categories of claims that the Indemnitor is responsible for, such as:

2. **Responsibility for Legal Issues**: The clause specifies that indemnification applies to issues arising ""in whole or in part out of the responsibilities set forth in this AGREEMENT.""

4. **Legal Defense**: The inclusion of ""defend each other"" indicates that if a party faces legal action due to a violation of law related to the agreement, the other party is obligated to provide a defense, which is a critical aspect of indemnification in legal contexts.

1. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the Indemnitor will indemnify the Indemnitee against claims arising from:
   - Breaches of obligations, warranties, representations, or covenants in the agreement (Section 12.1(a)).
   - Personal injury or property damage due to the fault or negligence of the Indemnitor (Section 12.1(b)).
   - Infringement or misappropriation of third-party rights (Section 12.1(c)).

2. **Implications for Violations of Law**: If a violation of law leads to a claim, suit, or proceeding against the Indemnitee, it could potentially fall under the indemnification obligations. For example:
   - If the Indemnitor's breach of the agreement results in a legal claim (e.g., a regulatory violation), the Indemnitee could seek indemnification for losses incurred due to that claim.
   - If the Indemnitor's negligence results in a legal issue (e.g., causing harm that violates safety laws), the Indemnitee could also be indemnified for related claims.

3. **Legal Fees and Expenses**: The clause explicitly mentions that the Indemnitor is responsible for covering reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with claims. This is particularly relevant in cases where legal action arises from violations of law.

4. **Limitations on Liability**: The clause also includes a limitation on liability for indirect or consequential damages (Section 12.2). This means that while the Indemnitor is responsible for direct claims, they may not be liable for certain types of damages that could arise from violations of law, unless those damages are directly linked to the indemnified claims.

In summary, while the clause does not explicitly state that it covers violations of law, it provides a framework for indemnification that could encompass such violations, particularly if they lead to claims against the Indemnitee. The clause's broad language regarding claims and the obligation to cover legal expenses supports the potential for indemnification in cases involving legal violations.",5
seller-favorable indemnification clauses,ab20fdf3c5,"11. Indemnity; limitation of liability. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from and against all claims, demands, actions, penalties, fines, damages, losses, expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs), known or unknown bodily and personal injuries or death or property damage and the consequences thereof, and liabilities of any kind (together, “Claims”) related to any Goods sold to Buyer by Seller or any Services performed by Seller for Buyer, except to the extent such Claims arise out of Buyer’s gross negligence, Buyer’s intentional misconduct, or Buyer’s improper storage or handling of Goods. Seller must defend Buyer in any actions or legal proceedings arising out of Claims with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. This indemnification obligation will survive Seller’s delivery of Goods or furnishing of Services to Buyer. The amount of Seller’s insurance in no way limits Seller’s indemnification obligations. Mutual indemnification on food especially – limitation of liability","The clause provided outlines an indemnification agreement that is seller-favorable, as it places the burden of indemnification primarily on the seller while limiting the seller's liability under certain conditions. Here’s how it relates to the query regarding seller-favorable indemnification clauses:

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause explicitly states that the seller agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the buyer from various claims, demands, and liabilities related to goods sold or services performed. This is a strong seller-favorable position because it requires the seller to take responsibility for a wide range of potential issues that may arise from their products or services.

2. **Exclusions for Buyer’s Actions**: The clause includes a limitation that the seller is not liable for claims arising from the buyer's gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or improper handling of goods. This limitation protects the seller from being held responsible for issues that are not within their control, which is a favorable aspect for the seller.

3. **Defense Requirement**: The seller is obligated to defend the buyer in any legal actions related to the claims, which further emphasizes the seller's responsibility and commitment to protect the buyer from potential legal repercussions.

4. **Survival of Obligation**: The indemnification obligation survives the delivery of goods or services, meaning that the seller's responsibility continues even after the transaction is completed. This is advantageous for the buyer but indicates a long-term commitment from the seller.

5. **Insurance Limitation**: The clause states that the amount of the seller's insurance does not limit their indemnification obligations. This reinforces the seller's responsibility and ensures that they cannot escape liability simply by having insurance coverage.

Overall, this clause is relevant to the query as it exemplifies a seller-favorable indemnification structure by placing significant liability on the seller while providing them with certain protections against the buyer's actions. It highlights the balance of risk and responsibility in the contractual relationship, favoring the seller in terms of indemnification obligations.",5

Here’s how it relates to seller-favorable indemnification clauses:

1. **Mutual Indemnification**: The clause includes mutual indemnification, where both parties agree to indemnify each other for losses resulting from their respective wrongful or negligent acts. This is not inherently seller-favorable, as it places equal responsibility on both parties.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that the indemnification covers losses incurred by the Seller, its Affiliates, and Seller’s Agents due to the actions of the Buyer. This aspect can be seen as favorable to the Seller, as it ensures that the Seller is protected against claims arising from the Buyer’s actions.

3. **Exclusion of Gross Negligence and Willful Misconduct**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will indemnify the other for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This provision limits the indemnification obligations, which can be seen as a protective measure for both parties. However, if the Seller is more likely to be in a position where the Buyer’s actions could lead to claims against them, this could be viewed as less favorable to the Seller.

4. **Legal Fees**: The inclusion of ""reasonable attorney fees"" in the indemnification obligations is beneficial for the Seller, as it ensures that they can recover legal costs incurred in defending against claims related to the Buyer’s actions.

In summary, while the clause is mutual in nature, it contains elements that can be considered favorable to the Seller, particularly in terms of protecting against claims arising from the Buyer’s actions and covering legal fees. However, the overall balance of favorability would depend on the specific context of the transaction and the relative risks each party faces. For a clause to be more seller-favorable, it could be structured to limit the Seller's indemnification obligations or expand the scope of indemnification for the Seller's benefit.",4

8.1 Indemnification by the Suppliers Each of the Suppliers shall, with respect to Products supplied by such Supplier, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any third party claims, expenses and costs (including but not limited to attorney and other professional fees and expenses), settlement (if negotiated and approved by the relevant Supplier), damages and liability to the extent arising from a claim (a) alleging that a Product infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights, or (b) arising under products liability theory from a manufacturing defect, and shall pay any judgments finally awarded by a court or any amounts contained in a settlement agreed to by the relevant Supplier arising from such claims. The foregoing indemnity does not cover claims that solely arise from (i) the modification of the Product by any party other than the relevant Supplier, (ii) the combination or use of the Product with other products, processes, methods, materials or devices except as approved by the relevant Supplier, or (iii) the fault of the Company.

1. **Supplier's Indemnification (Section 8.1)**: This section requires the Suppliers to indemnify the Company against claims related to intellectual property infringement and product liability arising from manufacturing defects. This is favorable to the Company (the buyer) because it shifts the risk of these claims onto the Suppliers, ensuring that the Company is protected from potential legal and financial repercussions stemming from the Suppliers' products.

2. **Company's Indemnification (Section 8.2)**: Conversely, this section requires the Company to indemnify the Suppliers for claims that are not covered by the Suppliers' indemnification obligations. This means that if a claim arises that is not due to the Suppliers' actions or products, the Company must defend and hold the Suppliers harmless. This could be seen as less favorable to the Suppliers, as they are still exposed to certain risks.

In the context of seller-favorable indemnification clauses, the clause as a whole can be analyzed for balance. While the Suppliers have a clear obligation to indemnify the Company for specific claims, the Company also has indemnification obligations that could limit the Suppliers' exposure. 

For a clause to be considered seller-favorable, it would typically include provisions that limit the seller's liability, narrow the scope of indemnification, or impose conditions that make it more difficult for the buyer to claim indemnification. In this case, the clause does not appear to be particularly seller-favorable, as it places significant indemnification responsibilities on the Suppliers without offering them substantial protections against claims arising from the Company's actions. 

Overall, the relevance lies in the balance of indemnification responsibilities and how they may favor one party over the other, which is a critical consideration in contract negotiations.",4

Here’s how these clauses can be interpreted in the context of seller-favorable terms:

1. **Supplier Indemnification (Section 8.1)**: This clause requires each Supplier to indemnify the Company against third-party claims related to intellectual property infringement and product liability arising from manufacturing defects. This is favorable to the Company (the buyer) because it places the burden of defense and liability on the Suppliers for specific claims. The Suppliers are responsible for covering costs, including legal fees and any settlements or judgments, which protects the Company from financial exposure related to these claims.

2. **Company Indemnification (Section 8.2)**: Conversely, this clause requires the Company to indemnify the Suppliers for claims that are not covered by the Suppliers' indemnification obligations. This creates a balance, but it is still somewhat favorable to the Suppliers because it limits their exposure to claims arising from the Company's actions or modifications to the products.

3. **Limited Liability (Section 9.1)**: This section limits the liability of the parties involved, which can be seen as a seller-favorable term for the Suppliers. It caps their liability to the amounts actually paid for the products in the twelve months prior to the claim, thereby protecting them from extensive financial repercussions. Additionally, it excludes liability for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, which further limits the potential financial impact on the Suppliers.

In summary, while the indemnification clauses create a framework for liability and defense obligations, they also reflect a balance of risk between the Suppliers and the Company. The specific terms can be seen as seller-favorable in that they limit the Suppliers' exposure and liability while placing significant responsibility on the Suppliers for certain claims. This structure is crucial for negotiating the terms of the agreement to ensure that the interests of the parties are adequately protected.",5

The Supplier shall add the distributor to their current insurance certificate.","The clause provided outlines an indemnification provision that is somewhat favorable to the seller (Supplier) in a contractual relationship with the distributor. Here’s how it relates to the query regarding seller-favorable indemnification clauses:

1. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause specifies that the Supplier (seller) will indemnify the Distributor against liabilities related to property damage, death, or personal injury arising from defects in the product design. This is a seller-favorable aspect because it places the responsibility for these liabilities primarily on the Supplier, which is beneficial for the Distributor.

2. **Exclusion of Liability**: The clause includes a limitation on the Supplier's indemnification obligation, stating that the Supplier is not liable for claims arising from the ""wilful misconduct of the Distributor."" This is a seller-favorable provision because it protects the Supplier from being held responsible for issues that arise due to the Distributor's own intentional wrongdoing.

3. **Defense and Hold Harmless**: The Supplier is required to defend and hold harmless the Distributor against relevant claims. This means that the Supplier must take on the legal responsibility and costs associated with defending against such claims, which is advantageous for the Distributor.

4. **Insurance Requirement**: The clause also requires the Supplier to add the Distributor to their current insurance certificate. This further protects the Distributor by ensuring that there is insurance coverage available for claims that may arise, which is a favorable condition for the Distributor.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to the query as it demonstrates how the Supplier (seller) is taking on significant liability and responsibility for certain claims, while also limiting its exposure to claims arising from the Distributor's own misconduct. This balance of risk is a key aspect of seller-favorable indemnification clauses.",5

1. **Indemnification Obligation**: The clause explicitly states that the Seller agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Buyer from various claims, demands, and liabilities related to goods sold or services performed. This is a strong position for the Buyer, as it places the responsibility for potential legal issues squarely on the Seller.

2. **Scope of Indemnity**: The indemnification covers a broad range of claims, including bodily injury, personal injury, property damage, and associated expenses (like attorney fees). This comprehensive coverage protects the Buyer from a wide array of potential risks associated with the Seller's goods or services.

3. **Exclusions**: The clause includes specific exclusions where the Seller is not liable for indemnification, namely in cases of the Buyer's gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or improper handling of goods. This is a common feature in indemnification clauses, but the fact that the Seller bears the burden of proof for these exclusions is favorable to the Buyer.

4. **Defense Obligation**: The Seller is required to defend the Buyer in any legal actions arising from the claims, which further strengthens the Buyer's position. The requirement for the Seller to provide counsel that is satisfactory to the Buyer ensures that the Buyer's interests are adequately represented.

5. **Survival of Obligation**: The clause states that the indemnification obligation survives the delivery of goods or services, meaning that the Buyer remains protected even after the transaction is completed. This is particularly important in long-term agreements where issues may arise well after the initial sale.

6. **Insurance Limitation**: The clause clarifies that the amount of the Seller's insurance does not limit their indemnification obligations. This is crucial for the Buyer, as it ensures that the Seller cannot escape liability simply by having a limited insurance policy.

This is a buyer-favorable aspect because it places the burden of indemnification on the Buyer for its own actions, which is a common practice in contracts to protect the Seller.

2. **Mutual Indemnification**: While the clause also includes a reciprocal indemnification obligation where the Seller indemnifies the Buyer for its wrongful acts, the fact that the Buyer is explicitly mentioned first in the indemnification section can be seen as a buyer-favorable approach. It emphasizes the Buyer's responsibility and may suggest a stronger position for the Buyer in negotiations.

3. **Limitation on Indemnification**: The clause includes a provision that neither party will indemnify the other for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is relevant because it protects both parties from liability for extreme misconduct, which can be seen as a balanced approach. However, it also means that the Buyer is not liable for indemnification in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Seller, which can be favorable for the Buyer.

4. **Legal Fees**: The inclusion of ""reasonable attorney fees"" in the indemnification obligations is also significant. It ensures that if either party incurs legal costs due to the other party's wrongful actions, those costs will be covered. This can be particularly favorable for the Buyer, as it provides a financial safety net in case of disputes.

2. **Company's Indemnification Obligations (Section 8.2)**: While this section also provides indemnification, it is structured to protect the Suppliers from claims that arise from the Company's actions.

3. **Exclusions from Indemnification**: Both sections include exclusions that limit the indemnification obligations based on certain conditions (e.g., modifications made by parties other than the Suppliers or the Company). This is important for the buyer to understand, as it delineates the circumstances under which indemnification would not apply, potentially leaving the buyer exposed to certain risks.

4. **Overall Balance**: The clause reflects a negotiation between the parties, where the buyer (the Company) seeks to ensure that it is protected from significant risks associated with the products supplied. A buyer-favorable indemnification clause would typically place more risk on the supplier, which is evident in Section 8.1.

1. **Indemnification by the Suppliers (Section 8.1)**:
   - This clause requires the Suppliers to indemnify the Company against third-party claims related to intellectual property infringement and product liability. This is favorable to the buyer (the Company) because it shifts the risk of certain claims onto the Suppliers, ensuring that the Company is protected from potential legal and financial repercussions arising from the Suppliers' products.
   - The clause specifies that the Suppliers are responsible for defending the Company and covering any associated costs, which is a strong position for the buyer.

2. **Indemnification by the Company (Section 8.2)**:
   - While this section outlines the Company's obligations to indemnify the Suppliers, it is still relevant to the overall indemnification framework. The Company’s indemnification obligations are limited to claims not covered by the Suppliers' indemnity. This creates a balanced approach but does not diminish the buyer's favorable position since the primary indemnity responsibility lies with the Suppliers.

3. **Limited Liability (Section 9.1)**:
   - This section limits the liability of the parties, which can be seen as a protective measure for both sides. However, it also emphasizes that indemnity obligations (as described in Article 8) are not subject to these limitations. This means that the indemnification obligations remain intact and enforceable, providing the buyer with a level of assurance that they will be compensated for certain claims regardless of the limitations on liability.

In summary, the indemnification clauses in this contract are structured to provide significant protection to the buyer (the Company) by ensuring that the Suppliers bear the responsibility for certain risks associated with their products.

10.6. Distributor Indemnity. Distributor will defend or settle, indemnify and hold Accuray harmless from any liability, damages and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) to the extent based upon a third-party claim based on or otherwise attributable to: (i) Distributor's acts or omissions not in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) any misrepresentations made by Distributor with respect to Accuray or the Products or Services.","The indemnification clause provided in the contract outlines the responsibilities of both Accuray and the Distributor regarding third-party claims. This clause is relevant to the query about buyer-favorable indemnification clauses for several reasons:

1. **Scope of Indemnity**: The clause specifies that Accuray will indemnify the Distributor for claims related to intellectual property infringement and product liability. This is favorable to the Distributor (the buyer in this context) because it shifts the risk of legal liability for these specific claims onto Accuray (the seller). The Distributor is protected from financial loss arising from third-party claims related to the products provided by Accuray.

2. **Defense and Settlement Control**: The clause grants Accuray the right to control the defense and settlement of any claims. While this may seem less favorable to the Distributor, it is common in indemnification clauses for the indemnifying party to retain control over the defense. However, the requirement for Accuray to defend the Distributor is a significant benefit, as it ensures that the Distributor does not have to bear the costs of legal defense for claims that arise from Accuray's products.

3. **Cost Coverage**: The clause explicitly states that Accuray will cover all costs, damages, and expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. This is a strong buyer-favorable aspect, as it ensures that the Distributor will not incur out-of-pocket expenses related to these claims.

4. **Distributor's Indemnity**: While the clause also includes a section where the Distributor must indemnify Accuray for claims arising from the Distributor's actions or misrepresentations, this is a standard reciprocal indemnity provision. The key point is that the primary indemnification obligations favor the Distributor, as they are protected against significant risks associated with the products supplied by Accuray.

In summary, the indemnification clause is relevant to the query as it illustrates how the contract provides protections for the buyer (Distributor) against specific risks, thereby creating a more favorable position for them in the event of third-party claims.",5

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable to the other for any consequential, indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or exemplary damages.

2. **Scope of Waiver**: The clause emphasizes that each party waives all rights and remedies related to indirect damages, reinforcing the intent to limit liability. This waiver is significant because it protects both parties from claims that could arise from unforeseen or indirect consequences of their actions or inactions under the agreement.

1. **Definition of Non-compensatory Damages**: The clause specifically mentions the waiver of ""punitive or exemplary damages."" These types of damages are typically considered non-compensatory because they are intended to punish the wrongdoer rather than to compensate the injured party for actual losses. 

2. **Implication for Consequential Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention ""consequential damages,"" it implies a broader limitation on damages that can be claimed. Consequential damages are often considered a subset of non-compensatory damages, as they arise from indirect consequences of a breach (e.g., lost profits, loss of business opportunities). By waiving the right to punitive damages, the parties may also be indicating that they do not intend to seek consequential damages, as both types of damages are typically not recoverable in many contractual agreements.

3. **Adequacy of Remedies**: The clause states that the remedies provided in the agreement and other remedies at law or in equity will be adequate. This suggests that the parties believe that the agreed-upon remedies are sufficient to address any breaches, further supporting the idea that they are waiving the right to seek additional damages, including consequential damages.

4. **Experience and Understanding**: The clause notes that both parties are experienced in negotiating such agreements and have had legal counsel, indicating that they fully understand the implications of waiving these types of damages. This reinforces the enforceability of the waiver and the intention behind it.

2. **Scope of Liability**: The clause outlines that the waiver applies regardless of the nature of the claim (contract, tort, etc.) and even if the party allegedly liable was aware of the possibility of such damages.

3. **Tort Claim Waiver**: The clause further emphasizes the waiver by stating that each party waives the right to recover economic losses or damages under tort theories, including negligence.

This aligns with the general understanding of consequential damages, which are losses that do not flow directly from a breach but are a secondary result of the breach.

2. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause waives liability for these types of damages, meaning that if one party breaches the agreement, the other party cannot claim these consequential damages as part of their remedy. This is a common practice in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable damages.

3. **Foreseeability and Notification**: The clause further emphasizes that the exclusion of liability for these types of damages applies regardless of whether the damages were foreseeable or whether the parties were advised of the possibility of such damages. This reinforces the intent to limit liability comprehensively.

4. **Legal Theories**: The clause also states that the limitation applies regardless of the legal or equitable theory upon which a claim is based (contract, tort, etc.), which broadens the scope of the disclaimer and protects against various legal claims.

In summary, this clause serves as a clear disclaimer of punitive damages, ensuring that both parties understand and agree that they will not seek or be liable for such damages in connection with any breaches of the agreement. This is a critical aspect of risk management in contractual agreements.",5

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall have any liability for ""indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages."" This is a clear disclaimer of punitive damages, which are typically awarded in legal cases as a form of punishment to the wrongdoer, rather than as compensation for actual losses suffered by the injured party.

2. **Scope of Damages**: By including punitive damages in the list of excluded liabilities, the clause protects both parties from being held liable for such damages, regardless of whether they were aware of the possibility of such damages occurring. This is significant in contract law, as it helps to limit the potential financial exposure of each party in the event of a breach or dispute.

3. **Exclusion of Warranties**: The clause also mentions that neither party makes any representations or warranties regarding the tools and services contemplated by the agreement, which further reinforces the idea that parties are not liable for any damages that may arise from the use of those tools and services, including punitive damages.

In summary, this clause serves as a protective measure for both parties by disclaiming liability for punitive damages, thereby limiting their exposure to potentially significant financial penalties that could arise from breaches of the agreement.",5

(ii) its legal obligations to third parties wherein nothing in this Agreement is intended to impair a party's contribution and indemnity rights under law with respect to third party claims.","The clause provided, particularly sections 11.02, 11.03, and 11.04, is relevant to the query about the disclaimer of strict liability because it outlines the limitations of liability and the disclaimers that the parties agree upon in the context of their contractual relationship.

1. **Disclaimer of Liability**: Section 11.02 explicitly states that the Disclosing Party disclaims liability for any loss or damage sustained by the Receiving Party from the use of or reliance on the information and materials provided. This is a clear disclaimer of liability, including for negligence, which is relevant to strict liability principles. In strict liability cases, a party can be held liable regardless of fault, but this clause seeks to limit that liability.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect or Enhanced Damages**: Section 11.03 further reinforces the disclaimer by stating that neither party will be liable for consequential, indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or exemplary damages. This is significant because strict liability often involves holding a party accountable for damages that arise from their actions, regardless of intent or negligence. By excluding these types of damages, the parties are effectively limiting their exposure to liability, which is a common practice in contracts to mitigate risk.

3. **Exceptions to Limitations**: Section 11.04 outlines specific exceptions to the limitations of liability, such as gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that while the parties are disclaiming liability for most situations, they still retain responsibility for serious misconduct. This is important in the context of strict liability, as it acknowledges that there are circumstances under which liability cannot be waived, particularly when there is a higher degree of fault involved.

Overall, the clause serves to limit the liability of the parties involved, including a disclaimer of strict liability, while also recognizing certain exceptions where liability cannot be disclaimed. This is a common approach in legal contracts to balance risk and responsibility between the parties.",5

Here’s how it is relevant to your query:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages suffered by the other party under the agreement. This aligns with the principles of a disclaimer of strict liability, as it seeks to limit the scope of liability that could arise from various claims, including those that might be based on strict liability.

2. **Broad Scope of Exemption**: The language used in the clause indicates that the exemption from liability applies regardless of the cause of action (contract, tort, negligence, etc.), which is a common feature in disclaimers of strict liability. This means that even if a party were to be found liable under strict liability principles, they would still be exempt from certain types of damages.

3. **Foreseeability and Notification**: The clause mentions that the limitation applies even if the damages were foreseeable or if a party had been advised of the possibility of such losses. This further reinforces the intent to limit liability, which is a key aspect of disclaimers in legal agreements.

4. **Exceptions to the Disclaimer**: The clause also notes exceptions to this limitation, specifically in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is important because it indicates that while the parties are disclaiming liability for certain damages, they are still accountable for egregious behavior, which is a common legal principle that prevents parties from completely absolving themselves of responsibility in cases of serious wrongdoing.

This is a common approach in contracts to limit liability and protect parties from claims that could arise from unforeseen or indirect consequences of their actions or failures to act.

In the context of strict liability, which typically holds a party liable for damages regardless of fault or negligence, this clause serves to disclaim such liability by explicitly stating that the parties do not make any representations or warranties regarding the tools and services involved in the agreement.

Strict liability typically holds a party responsible for damages or harm caused by their actions or products, regardless of fault or intent. By including a disclaimer of warranties, the parties are attempting to limit their liability for any claims that may arise, including those that could fall under strict liability. The clause emphasizes that the parties are not liable for any implied warranties, such as those related to merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, which could otherwise expose them to strict liability claims.

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including lost profits. This is a common way to limit liability in contracts, which can help protect parties from being held strictly liable for damages that are not directly caused by their actions.

2. **Exclusion of Certain Liabilities**: The clause also notes that these limitations do not apply to obligations related to indemnity, confidentiality, or instances of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that while the parties are disclaiming liability for certain types of damages, they are still accountable for more serious breaches or misconduct.

3. **Relevance to Strict Liability**: A disclaimer of strict liability typically means that a party is not held liable for damages without proof of negligence or fault. The limitation of liability clause serves a similar purpose by restricting the types of damages for which a party can be held liable, thereby reducing the risk of being held strictly liable for indirect or consequential damages.

In summary, this clause is relevant because it establishes a framework for liability that can help mitigate the risk of strict liability claims by limiting the types of damages recoverable and clarifying the circumstances under which liability may arise.",5

1. **Scope of Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for various types of damages, including ""consequential, multiple, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary or punitive damages."" This aligns with the concept of a unilateral waiver of indirect damages, as it limits the liability of both parties for these specific types of damages arising from breaches of the agreement.

2. **Mutuality**: While the term ""unilateral"" typically implies that only one party waives certain rights or claims, this clause applies to both parties equally. It establishes a mutual understanding that neither party will seek recovery for indirect damages, which is a common practice in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable claims.

3. **Exclusions**: The clause also notes that the waiver does not limit a party's obligation to indemnify the other against claims from unaffiliated third parties. This is important because it clarifies that while indirect damages are waived between the parties, there are still responsibilities regarding third-party claims, which may include indirect damages.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The clause emphasizes that the waiver applies regardless of the circumstances, including negligence or other conditions. This broad language reinforces the intent to limit liability for indirect damages comprehensively.

1. **Scope of Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that each party waives and releases any right to claim or receive punitive or exemplary damages from the other party. This aligns with the idea of a unilateral waiver, as it indicates that one party is relinquishing its right to seek certain types of damages, which could be considered indirect or non-compensatory.

2. **Acknowledgment of Adequate Remedies**: The clause emphasizes that the parties acknowledge the remedies provided in the agreement (and other legal remedies) are adequate. This suggests that the parties have agreed to limit their potential claims to those that are compensatory in nature, thereby excluding indirect damages that are not directly tied to the actual loss suffered.

3. **Legal Context**: The waiver of punitive or exemplary damages is a common practice in contracts to limit liability and avoid excessive claims that could arise from indirect damages. This is particularly relevant in commercial agreements where parties seek to manage risk and ensure predictability in their legal relationships.

4. **Experience and Understanding**: The clause also notes that both parties are experienced in negotiating such agreements and have had legal counsel, which reinforces the notion that they fully understand the implications of waiving these types of damages.

In summary, the clause serves to protect both parties from claims for indirect damages, which is a key aspect of a unilateral indirect damages waiver.

Here’s how it relates to the concept of a unilateral indirect damages waiver:

1. **Waiver of Liability**: The clause effectively waives liability for indirect damages, which aligns with the idea of a unilateral waiver. This means that one party is agreeing not to hold the other party responsible for certain types of damages, specifically those that are indirect or consequential in nature.

2. **Scope of Damages**: The clause specifies that this waiver applies regardless of the cause of action (contract, tort, etc.) and even if the damages were foreseeable or if the party had been advised of the possibility of such losses. This broad scope reinforces the unilateral nature of the waiver, as it limits the liability of one party without requiring a reciprocal waiver from the other.

3. **Exceptions**: The clause also notes exceptions to this waiver, such as in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, which is a common practice in liability waivers. This indicates that while the waiver is broad, it does not absolve a party from liability in cases of serious wrongdoing.

4. **Indemnification Context**: The clause is situated within a broader context of indemnification (Sections 16.1 and 16.2), which may provide additional layers of protection and obligations between the parties.

The clause indicates that both parties acknowledge that the remedies provided in the agreement, as well as other legal remedies, are adequate, thus reinforcing the waiver of non-compensatory damages.

3. **Limitation of Liability**: By waiving the right to claim punitive or exemplary damages, the parties are effectively limiting their liability to each other. This is a common practice in contracts to avoid unpredictable and potentially large claims that could arise from indirect damages.

4. **Legal Understanding**: The clause also emphasizes that both parties are experienced in negotiating such agreements and have had legal counsel, which suggests that they fully understand the implications of waiving these types of damages. This is important in ensuring that the waiver is enforceable and that both parties are aware of the risks involved.

In summary, this clause serves to establish a mutual understanding between the parties that they will not seek punitive or exemplary damages from each other, which is a key aspect of a mutual indirect damages waiver. It helps to clarify the limitations on liability and the nature of the remedies available under the agreement.",5

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Waiver of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. This indicates a clear intention to limit liability for indirect damages, which is a central aspect of the query.

2. **Legal Context**: The clause also mentions that this waiver applies regardless of the circumstances, including negligence or fault of the party whose liability is being waived. This suggests that the parties have agreed to a broad waiver of indirect damages, which may be subject to legal scrutiny depending on the jurisdiction and applicable laws.

3. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause includes a provision that the waiver does not limit a party's obligation to indemnify the other party against claims from unaffiliated third parties. This indicates that while the parties may waive indirect damages between themselves, they still recognize potential liabilities that could arise from third-party claims, which could be subject to different legal standards.

4. **Implications of Applicable Law**: The effectiveness and enforceability of such waivers can vary based on jurisdictional laws. Some jurisdictions may not allow the waiver of certain types of damages, especially if they are deemed to be against public policy. Therefore, the clause's enforceability could be influenced by the applicable law, which is a critical aspect of the query.

It is particularly relevant to the query about the indirect damage waiver being subject to law for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that a party's liability is limited to direct damages proven, and it excludes liability for incidental or consequential damages. This aligns with the concept of an indirect damage waiver, as it seeks to limit the scope of liability for damages that are not directly caused by a party's actions.

2. **Legal Framework**: The clause indicates that the parties have agreed to these limitations within the context of the law. It suggests that the enforceability of these limitations, including the waiver of indirect damages, is subject to applicable laws. This means that while the parties may agree to waive certain types of damages, such waivers must still comply with relevant legal standards and cannot contravene public policy.

3. **Specific Performance and Remedies**: The external information provided discusses the right to specific performance and equitable relief in the event of a breach. This highlights that while the parties may limit liability for certain damages, they still retain the right to seek specific performance or injunctions, which are legal remedies that may not be limited by the waiver of indirect damages. This interplay between waivers and legal remedies underscores the importance of understanding how such clauses operate within the framework of applicable law.

4. **Irreparable Damage**: The external information also mentions that irreparable damage may occur if the agreement is not performed as specified. This concept is relevant because it suggests that even if indirect damages are waived, there may still be circumstances under which a party can seek legal recourse for harm that cannot be adequately compensated through monetary damages alone.

In summary, the clause is relevant to the query as it establishes the framework for liability limitations, including the waiver of indirect damages, while also acknowledging that such waivers must be consistent with applicable laws and legal remedies available to the parties.",5

1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: Section 27.2 explicitly states that neither party will be liable for any special, indirect, or consequential damages related to a purchase order, even if those damages are foreseeable. This indicates a clear intention to limit liability for indirect damages, which is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from unforeseen liabilities.

2. **Legal Limitations**: The clause acknowledges that certain liabilities cannot be excluded or limited as a matter of law, particularly in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, death, or personal injuries. This suggests that while the parties may agree to limit liability for indirect damages, they must still comply with applicable laws that may impose stricter liability standards. This aligns with the query about the indirect damage waiver being subject to law, as it indicates that the waiver is not absolute and must adhere to legal requirements.

3. **Direct Damages Acknowledgment**: Section 27.3 clarifies that damages resulting from breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or data security obligations are considered direct damages and are not subject to the same limitations as indirect damages. This distinction reinforces the idea that while indirect damages can be waived, certain types of damages must be acknowledged and cannot be waived, again highlighting the influence of law on the enforceability of such waivers.

4. **Limitation of Liability for Specific Parties**: Sections 27.4 and 27.5 outline specific limitations of liability for both VF and the Supplier, indicating that while they can limit their liability, they must still operate within the bounds of the law. This further emphasizes that any waiver of liability, including for indirect damages, is subject to legal scrutiny and cannot contravene statutory obligations.

In summary, the clause illustrates how the parties to the contract are attempting to limit their liability for indirect damages while recognizing that such limitations must comply with applicable laws. This directly relates to the query about the indirect damage waiver being subject to law, as it highlights the legal framework within which such waivers operate.",5

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages suffered by the other party. This is a clear waiver of liability for indirect damages, which is often a point of contention in legal agreements.

2. **Legal Context**: The clause indicates that this waiver is applicable unless expressly provided otherwise in the agreement. This means that the parties have agreed to limit their liability for indirect damages, which is a common practice in contracts to mitigate risk. However, it also implies that such waivers must be compliant with applicable laws. 

3. **Exceptions**: The clause notes that the limitation of liability does not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is significant because it acknowledges that while the parties are waiving liability for indirect damages, there are legal boundaries that cannot be waived, particularly when it comes to serious misconduct.

4. **Implications of Applicable Law**: The mention of ""applicable law"" in the context of the waiver suggests that the enforceability of this clause may depend on the jurisdiction's laws governing contracts. Some jurisdictions may have specific statutes or case law that limit the extent to which parties can waive liability for indirect damages, especially in consumer contracts or where public policy considerations are at play.

Specifically, it states that neither party's aggregate liability arising from the agreement or the transactions contemplated shall exceed a specified amount, except for liabilities under a particular section (in this case, Section 7.2 regarding indemnity).

Here's how this relates to the concept of an indirect damage waiver:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause effectively waives liability for certain types of damages, which may include indirect or consequential damages. This means that if one party suffers indirect damages as a result of the other party's actions (or inactions), they may not be able to recover those damages if they exceed the specified limit.

2. **Legal Context**: The mention of ""subject to law"" implies that while the parties can agree to limit their liability, such limitations must still comply with applicable laws. Certain jurisdictions may have specific regulations regarding the enforceability of damage waivers, particularly concerning indirect damages. Therefore, the enforceability of this clause could be influenced by local laws governing contracts and liability.

3. **Irreparable Damage and Remedies**: The external information provided discusses the concept of irreparable damage and the right to seek specific performance or equitable relief. This indicates that, in certain situations, parties may still seek remedies beyond monetary damages, especially if the limitations set forth in the agreement do not adequately address the harm caused by a breach. This interplay between the limitation of damages and the right to seek equitable relief is crucial in understanding how indirect damage waivers operate within the legal framework.

Here’s how it connects to the query:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause specifies that each party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party from any losses, damages, injuries, or liabilities arising from claims made by third parties. This is a fundamental aspect of indemnification, which is often included in contracts to allocate risk between the parties.

2. **Direct vs. Indirect Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention an indirect damage waiver, it is important to understand that indemnification typically covers direct damages resulting from breaches of the agreement or negligence. An indirect damage waiver would generally exclude liability for consequential or indirect damages, which are not directly caused by a party's actions. The indemnification clause focuses on direct claims and losses, which may imply that indirect damages are not covered under this indemnification provision.

3. **Claims Procedure**: The clause outlines a detailed procedure for how claims for indemnification should be handled, including notification requirements and the rights of the indemnifying party to control the defense. This procedural aspect is crucial in the context of an indirect damage waiver because it establishes how claims are managed, which can affect the enforceability of any waivers related to indirect damages.

4. **Potential Carveouts**: If the parties wish to include a carveout for indirect damages within the indemnification framework, they would need to explicitly state that certain types of damages (like indirect or consequential damages) are excluded from the indemnification obligations. The current clause does not provide such carveouts, but it sets the stage for discussions on how to handle indirect damages in relation to indemnification.

In summary, while the clause does not directly address an indemnification carveout to an indirect damage waiver, it establishes the indemnification framework that would need to be considered when drafting or negotiating such a carveout. The parties may need to clarify their intentions regarding indirect damages in relation to the indemnification obligations outlined in this clause.",4

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: Section 12.3 explicitly states that no party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. This is a typical provision in contracts to limit liability for damages that are not directly caused by a breach of the agreement.

2. **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause includes a critical exception to the general waiver of liability for indirect damages. It states that the limitation on liability does not apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses (which could include indirect damages), the waiver of liability for indirect damages does not apply. 

3. **Implications**: This carveout is significant because it ensures that even though parties are generally not liable for indirect damages, they can still be held accountable for indemnification obligations that may arise from such damages. This creates a balance between limiting liability and ensuring that parties can seek indemnification for specific losses that may not be directly tied to a breach but are still significant enough to warrant compensation.

4. **Limitation on Liability**: Section 12.4 further reinforces the limitation on liability by capping the maximum aggregate liability of each party. This means that while parties may be indemnified for certain losses, there is still a cap on the total amount that can be claimed, which is an important consideration in risk management.

In summary, the clause you provided outlines a framework where parties can limit their liability for indirect damages while still allowing for indemnification obligations to be enforceable, thus creating a carveout that protects parties from certain types of losses while maintaining a level of accountability.",5

This section reinforces the idea that while there are limitations on liability, the indemnification obligations (as noted in Section 12.3) may still allow for recovery beyond those limitations in certain circumstances.

In summary, the clause establishes a framework where parties are generally protected from liability for indirect damages, but it carves out an exception for indemnification obligations, allowing for potential recovery of such damages in specific situations. This is crucial for understanding the balance between limiting liability and ensuring that parties can still seek indemnification for certain losses.",5
indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The clause provided, titled ""GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION,"" is relevant to your query regarding an indemnification carveout to an indirect damage waiver because it outlines the obligations and conditions under which one party (the indemnifying party) must defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party (the indemnified party) from certain claims and damages.

### Key Points of Relevance:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause establishes that each party is responsible for indemnifying the other against claims, losses, liabilities, and expenses arising from third-party actions, particularly those related to bodily injury or damage to tangible personal property. This is a fundamental aspect of indemnification.

2. **Exclusions and Limitations**: While the clause does not explicitly mention an indirect damage waiver, it implicitly suggests that certain types of damages may not be covered. For example, it specifies that damages related to ""lost or damaged data"" are excluded from indemnification. This could be interpreted as a form of indirect damage waiver, as it limits the scope of indemnification to specific types of claims.

3. **Allocation of Fault**: The clause includes a provision for the allocation of damages based on the relative fault of the parties involved. This means that if the indemnified party's actions contributed to the claim, the indemnifying party's liability could be reduced. This aspect is crucial when considering how indirect damages might be treated, as it allows for a nuanced approach to liability based on the circumstances of each claim.

4. **Conditions for Indemnification**: The clause outlines specific conditions that must be met for indemnification to apply, such as prompt notification of claims and cooperation in the defense. This ensures that the indemnifying party has the opportunity to manage the claim effectively, which is important in the context of any waivers or limitations on liability.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the ""GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION"" clause is relevant to your query as it sets the framework for how indemnification operates between the parties, including potential carveouts for indirect damages. While it does not explicitly state an indirect damage waiver, the exclusions and conditions outlined in the clause suggest a careful consideration of what types of damages are covered, which is essential when drafting or negotiating indemnification provisions in contracts.",5
indemnification carveout to indirect damage waiver,0eabff6ea5,"14.4 Indemnification You shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent by law us, our affiliates and our respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, and agents, (collectively the ""Indemnitees"") from any and all losses and expenses (as hereinafter defined) incurred in connection with any litigation or other form of adjudicatory procedure, claim, demand, investigation, or formal or informal inquiry (regardless of whether same is reduced to judgment) or any settlement thereof which arises directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business including, but not limited to, claims arising as a result of the maintenance and operation of vehicles (collectively an ""event""), and regardless of whether same resulted from any strict or vicarious liability imposed by law on the Indemnitees; provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any liability arising from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees (except to the extent that joint liability is involved, in which event the indemnification provided herein shall extend to any finding of comparative negligence or contributory negligence attributable to you). For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel. Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause provided, specifically Section 14.4 on Indemnification, is relevant to the query regarding an indemnification carveout to an indirect damage waiver for several reasons:

1. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause outlines the indemnification obligations of one party (presumably the franchisee) to indemnify and hold harmless the other party (the franchisor and its affiliates) from various losses and expenses arising from claims related to the operation of the franchised business. This includes a broad range of liabilities, which may encompass indirect damages.

2. **Exclusions**: The clause includes a specific carveout regarding the indemnification obligation, stating that it does not apply to liabilities arising from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees. This is a critical aspect of an indemnification carveout, as it delineates the circumstances under which indemnification is not applicable, particularly in cases of gross negligence.

3. **Indirect Damages**: The clause mentions that ""losses and expenses"" include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages, which can be interpreted to encompass indirect damages. This is relevant to the query as it indicates that while the indemnification covers a wide range of damages, there may be specific limitations or exclusions that need to be considered when drafting an indirect damage waiver.

4. **Defense Obligations**: The clause also outlines the responsibilities of the indemnifying party to defend the Indemnitees against claims, which is a common feature in indemnification clauses. This aspect may be relevant when considering how indirect damage waivers interact with indemnification obligations, particularly in terms of who bears the costs of defense in the event of a claim.

5. **Prompt Notice and Assumption of Defense**: The requirement for prompt notice of events requiring indemnification and the ability of the indemnified party to assume the defense (without being obligated to do so) further illustrates the dynamics of indemnification in relation to potential claims, including those that may involve indirect damages.

In summary, this indemnification clause provides a framework for understanding how indemnification obligations are structured, the scope of coverage, and the limitations that may apply, which are all critical considerations when discussing an indemnification carveout to an indirect damage waiver.",5
IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided states that, with the exception of claims or liabilities arising from the infringement of third-party intellectual property (IP) rights, neither party shall be liable for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. This is relevant to your query about the ""IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver"" because it explicitly carves out an exception to the general waiver of liability for indirect damages in the context of IP infringement.

Here's how it connects:

1. **Exception to Waiver**: The clause indicates that while parties typically waive liability for indirect damages, this waiver does not apply in cases of IP infringement. This means that if one party infringes on a third party's intellectual property rights, they can still be held liable for indirect damages resulting from that infringement.

2. **Protection of IP Rights**: The clause serves to protect the rights of third parties whose intellectual property may be infringed upon. It ensures that parties cannot escape liability for significant damages that may arise from such infringements, which could include lost profits, reputational harm, or other consequential damages.

3. **Legal Implications**: In the context of legal agreements, this clause emphasizes the importance of respecting intellectual property rights and acknowledges that breaches in this area can lead to substantial harm that cannot be adequately addressed through a simple waiver of indirect damages.

In summary, the clause is relevant because it establishes a clear boundary regarding liability for indirect damages, specifically highlighting that such a waiver does not apply in cases of IP infringement, thereby ensuring accountability for violations of intellectual property rights.",5
IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,5da8e756e1,"9.3. Limitation of Liability. Except in connection with a breach by either party of Article 7 or Section 8.1.5 [REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES] (v) and the indemnification obligations of Impresse under Section 9.4(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY IMPRESSE] and the indemnification obligations of VerticalNet under Section 9.5(i)(d) [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET], neither party will be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages arising out of or related to this Agreement, however caused and under any theory of liability (including negligence), even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.3 on ""Limitation of Liability,"" is relevant to the query regarding the ""IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver"" because it outlines the general limitations on liability for both parties under the agreement. 

1. **Scope of Limitation**: The clause states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages arising from the agreement. This means that if one party were to infringe on the intellectual property (IP) rights of the other, they would typically not be liable for indirect damages resulting from that infringement.

2. **Exceptions to the Limitation**: The clause lists specific exceptions where liability is not limited, including breaches related to representations and warranties and indemnification obligations. If IP infringement were to fall under one of these exceptions (for example, if it were related to a breach of representations and warranties regarding IP rights), then the limitation on liability for indirect damages would not apply.

3. **Implications for IP Infringement**: If a party were to infringe on the other party's IP rights, the affected party might seek to argue that the limitation of liability does not apply in this case, especially if the infringement leads to significant indirect damages. The presence of exceptions in the clause suggests that the parties recognized certain serious breaches (like IP infringement) could warrant liability beyond the typical limitations.

In summary, while the clause generally limits liability for indirect damages, it also indicates that there are exceptions where such limitations may not apply, particularly in cases of significant breaches like IP infringement. This creates a potential pathway for a party to claim damages that would otherwise be waived under the limitation of liability clause.",5

This waiver is significant in the context of intellectual property (IP) infringement because it limits the liability of the parties involved in the event of a breach, which could include IP-related issues.

In the context of your query regarding an ""IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver,"" the clause suggests that while the parties are waiving liability for indirect damages, there may be a need to carve out exceptions for IP infringement claims. This is particularly relevant because IP infringement can lead to significant and unique damages that may not be adequately addressed by a general waiver of indirect damages.

The clause also includes a provision that allows for indemnification against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties, which could encompass IP infringement claims. This means that if one party infringes on the IP rights of a third party, they may still be liable to indemnify the other party for any resulting claims, even if indirect damages are waived.

In summary, while the clause waives liability for indirect damages, it is crucial to consider whether IP infringement claims should be treated differently, potentially allowing for exceptions to this waiver. This could ensure that parties retain the ability to seek remedies for IP-related issues that may not be adequately covered by the general waiver of indirect damages.",4

This includes losses such as loss of use, loss of profits, or loss of goodwill, even if the parties were aware of the potential for such losses.

The relevance of this clause to your query about the ""IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver"" is significant for several reasons:

1. **Exception for IP Infringement**: The clause clearly carves out an exception for liability related to intellectual property infringement. This means that if one party infringes on the intellectual property rights of the other, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for indirect damages that may arise from that infringement.

2. **Scope of Liability**: By stating that liability for IP infringement is not subject to the limitations on indirect damages, the clause ensures that the injured party can seek full compensation for any damages resulting from such infringement, including indirect damages that would typically be waived under the agreement.

3. **Legal Remedies**: The external information provided indicates that the parties acknowledge the potential for irreparable harm due to breaches of the agreement, including those related to intellectual property. This aligns with the notion that IP infringement can lead to significant and often non-quantifiable damages, justifying the exception to the waiver of indirect damages.

4. **Encouragement of Compliance**: By allowing for liability in cases of IP infringement, the clause serves as a deterrent against potential violations of intellectual property rights, encouraging both parties to comply with the terms of the agreement and respect each other's intellectual property.

In summary, Section 9.4 establishes a clear exception for intellectual property infringement, allowing for liability beyond the typical limitations on indirect damages. This is crucial for protecting the rights of the parties involved and ensuring that they can seek appropriate remedies in the event of an IP infringement.",5

Specifically, it includes several key points that are relevant to the query regarding the ""IP infringement exception to indirect damage waiver.""

1. **Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**: This section explicitly states that neither party will be liable for incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including lost profits or loss of business, as a result of any breach of the agreement. This is a broad waiver of indirect damages, which typically includes damages that are not directly caused by a breach but are a secondary result of it.

2. **Equitable Relief (Section 9.1)**: The clause allows either party to seek equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief, for breaches of obligations under Article 13 of the agreement. This is significant because, in cases of intellectual property (IP) infringement, parties often seek injunctive relief to prevent further infringement rather than just monetary damages. This indicates that while indirect damages may be waived, the parties still retain the right to seek equitable remedies in the case of IP infringement.

3. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**: This section further emphasizes the waiver of economic losses or damages under tort theories, which could include claims related to IP infringement. However, it is important to note that this waiver does not necessarily preclude seeking equitable relief for IP infringement, as mentioned earlier.

4. **Essential Elements (Section 9.7)**: This section highlights that the limitations of liability are essential to the agreement, indicating that both parties have agreed to these terms as a condition of entering into the contract. This reinforces the idea that the waiver of indirect damages is a fundamental aspect of the agreement.

In summary, while the clause generally waives indirect damages, it allows for equitable relief, which is crucial in cases of IP infringement. This means that even though parties may not be able to claim indirect damages, they can still seek injunctions or other equitable remedies to address breaches related to intellectual property. Thus, the clause is relevant to the query as it outlines the limitations on liability while also providing a pathway for addressing IP infringement through equitable means.",5

Here's a breakdown of its relevance:

1. **General Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause states that, generally, neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages. This is a common provision in contracts to limit liability and protect parties from extensive damages that may arise from unforeseen circumstances.

2. **Exception for Third Party IP Infringement**: The clause specifically states that this waiver does not apply to claims or liabilities arising from the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. This means that if one party infringes on a third party's IP rights, they cannot rely on the waiver to avoid liability for any resulting damages. 

3. **Importance of IP Rights**: Intellectual property rights are often critical assets for businesses, and infringement can lead to significant legal and financial consequences. By including this exception, the parties acknowledge the importance of protecting third-party IP rights and agree that liability for such infringements should not be limited by the general waiver of indirect damages.

In summary, this clause is relevant because it establishes a clear boundary around the liability waiver, ensuring that parties remain accountable for any claims related to third-party IP infringement, despite the broader limitation on indirect damages. This protects the interests of third parties and reinforces the importance of respecting intellectual property rights in contractual relationships.",5

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, consequential, exemplary, or incidental damages arising out of or related to the agreement. This means that if one party suffers damages that are not direct (i.e., not a direct result of a breach), they cannot claim compensation for those damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause also specifies exceptions to this limitation of liability, particularly in connection with breaches of certain sections (Article 7 and Section 8.1.5 regarding representations and warranties) and indemnification obligations. This implies that if a party breaches these specific provisions, they may still be held liable for damages that would otherwise be waived under the indirect damage waiver.

3. **Third-Party IP Infringement**: In the context of third-party IP infringement, if one party's actions lead to a claim of IP infringement by a third party, the indemnification obligations mentioned in the clause (Sections 9.4 and 9.5) may come into play. If a party is found liable for infringing on a third party's IP rights, they may be required to indemnify the other party, which could include covering damages that would otherwise be considered indirect.

In summary, while the clause generally limits liability for indirect damages, it also outlines specific exceptions where liability may still apply, particularly in cases of breaches related to representations, warranties, and indemnification obligations.

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause establishes a broad waiver of liability for indirect, consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, or punitive damages between the parties to the agreement. This means that, under normal circumstances, neither party can claim these types of damages from the other in the event of a breach of the agreement.

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**: Importantly, the clause includes a specific exception that states the waiver does not limit a party's obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties. This is crucial in the context of IP infringement, as it implies that if a third party asserts a claim against one of the parties for IP infringement, the party responsible for the infringement may still be liable for damages, including indirect damages, arising from that claim.

3. **Protection Against Third-Party Claims**: The language indicates that even though the parties have waived their rights to claim indirect damages from each other, they still retain the right to seek indemnification for claims made by third parties. This is particularly relevant in cases of IP infringement, where a third party may claim that one of the parties has infringed on their intellectual property rights, potentially leading to significant damages.

4. **Implications for Liability**: The clause clarifies that the waiver of indirect damages does not apply in the context of third-party claims, which means that if a third party alleges IP infringement, the affected party can pursue remedies that may include indirect damages, contrary to the general waiver outlined in the clause.

In summary, this clause is significant because it delineates the boundaries of liability between the parties while ensuring that they are still protected against third-party claims, particularly those related to IP infringement. This creates a framework where parties can be held accountable for third-party claims, even if they have waived certain types of damages in their direct dealings with each other.",5

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages. This is a common provision in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable damages that could arise from breaches or other issues.

2. **Exception for Third Party Claims**: The clause includes a specific exception that allows for the possibility of liability if ""special, non-compensatory, consequential, indirect, incidental, statutory or punitive damages have been awarded to a Third Party under a Third Party Claim."" This means that if a third party successfully claims damages against one of the parties (for example, due to IP infringement), the party may be liable for those damages, even if they would typically be exempt from such liability under the general terms of the clause.

3. **Relevance to IP Infringement**: In the context of third-party IP infringement, if one party's actions lead to a third party claiming damages for IP infringement, the limitation of liability clause does not protect the infringing party from liability for those damages. This is significant because it acknowledges that while parties may want to limit their liability for indirect damages, they cannot do so at the expense of third-party rights, particularly in cases of IP infringement.

4. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also notes that it does not limit a party's indemnification obligations. If one party is required to indemnify the other for third-party claims (which often includes IP infringement claims), this clause reinforces that the indemnifying party may still be liable for damages awarded to the third party, despite the general waiver of indirect damages.

In summary, this clause is relevant because it outlines the limitations on liability while also providing an exception for third-party claims, particularly in the context of IP infringement, thereby ensuring that parties cannot evade responsibility for damages awarded to third parties in such cases.",5
"indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third party IP infringement and fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct",a71ac5a987,"Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind","The clause you provided is relevant to the query regarding indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement and fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct for several reasons:

1. **Exclusion of Third-Party IP Infringement**: The clause explicitly states that it does not apply to claims or liabilities arising from the infringement of any third-party intellectual property rights. This aligns with the query's requirement to exclude third-party IP infringement from the waiver of liability for indirect damages. In other words, if a party is found liable for infringing on a third party's IP rights, they cannot invoke this clause to avoid liability for indirect damages related to that infringement.

2. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause clearly waives liability for special, indirect, consequential, punitive, or incidental damages of any kind, which is a central aspect of the query. It establishes that, generally, neither party will be held liable for these types of damages, thereby limiting their exposure in the event of a breach or other claims.

3. **Focus on Specific Exclusions**: The clause's structure highlights that while there is a broad waiver of indirect damages, certain exceptions apply. This is important in legal contracts, as it delineates the boundaries of liability and ensures that parties understand the specific circumstances under which they may still be held accountable.

4. **Relevance to Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: Although the clause does not explicitly mention fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, it is common in legal drafting to have separate provisions addressing these issues. Typically, liability waivers do not cover fraudulent actions or gross negligence, as these are considered serious breaches of duty. Therefore, while the clause does not directly state this, it is implied that such serious misconduct would not be protected under the waiver.

In summary, the clause effectively addresses the query by excluding liability for indirect damages in the context of third-party IP infringement while also suggesting that serious misconduct (like fraud or gross negligence) would likely not be covered by the waiver, even if not explicitly stated.",4

ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.5 titled ""Limitation of Liability,"" is relevant to your query regarding indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude third-party intellectual property (IP) infringement and fraud, as well as gross negligence or willful misconduct. Here's how it relates:

1. **Exclusion of Liability for Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, remote, exemplary, or speculative damages. This aligns with the concept of a damage waiver, as it limits the liability of the parties for certain types of damages that may arise from the agreement.

2. **Exceptions to the Limitation**: The clause includes specific exceptions where liability is not limited:
   - **Fraud**: It states that in the event of fraud by a party, the limitation of liability does not apply. This is relevant to your query as it indicates that fraudulent actions are excluded from the waiver of indirect damages.
   - **Breach of Intellectual Property Obligations**: The clause also specifies that breaches of obligations under Article 7 (which pertains to intellectual property) are exceptions to the limitation of liability. This means that if a party breaches its IP obligations, it cannot rely on the waiver to avoid liability for damages resulting from that breach.

3. **Indemnification for Third-Party Claims**: The clause mentions that damages required to be paid to a third party as part of a claim for which a party provides indemnification are also excluded from the limitation. This implies that if a third party claims damages related to IP infringement, the party responsible for indemnification cannot limit its liability for those damages.

4. **General Scope of Liability**: The clause emphasizes that liability is limited to damages that are ""not probable and reasonably foreseeable,"" which further narrows the scope of what can be claimed as damages, reinforcing the intent to limit liability for indirect damages.

In summary, this clause effectively waives liability for indirect damages while providing specific exceptions for fraud, breaches of IP obligations, and indemnification claims related to third-party damages. This aligns with your query about indirect damage waiver clauses that exclude certain types of misconduct and third-party claims.",5

1. **Limitations on Liability**: The clause explicitly states that, except in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud, neither party shall be liable for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages. This aligns with the query's focus on limiting liability for indirect damages.

2. **Exclusions for Specific Circumstances**: The clause outlines specific exceptions to the general limitation on liability, namely gross negligence, willful misconduct, and fraud. This is significant because it indicates that while the parties are waiving liability for indirect damages, they are still holding each other accountable for serious breaches of conduct, which is a common practice in legal agreements.

3. **No Injunctive Relief**: The clause also states that the non-breaching party shall not be entitled to equitable or injunctive relief of any kind, which further emphasizes the limitation on remedies available to the parties. This is relevant to the query as it indicates a clear boundary on the types of remedies that can be sought, which is often a concern in contracts involving IP and other sensitive matters.

4. **Exclusion of IP Infringement**: While the clause does not explicitly mention third-party IP infringement, it does refer to indemnification claims under Section 5 and breaches of specific sections related to trademarks and confidentiality. This suggests that the parties have considered IP-related issues in their liability framework, which is pertinent to the query about excluding third-party IP infringement.

In summary, the clause effectively addresses the query by outlining a framework for limiting liability for indirect damages while also specifying exceptions for serious misconduct, thereby providing a clear understanding of the parties' rights and obligations in relation to indirect damages and potential breaches.",4

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for ""special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or incidental damages"" arising out of or related to the agreement. This aligns with the concept of a damage waiver, as it limits the scope of liability for indirect damages.

2. **Exclusions for Specific Breaches**: The clause includes exceptions for breaches related to specific sections of the agreement, such as Article 7 (which likely pertains to representations and warranties) and certain indemnification obligations. This indicates that while the parties are waiving liability for indirect damages in general, they are still holding each other accountable for certain critical breaches, which may include IP infringement or fraud if those are covered under the specified sections.

3. **General Indemnification**: The references to indemnification obligations suggest that the parties have agreed to certain responsibilities that may include protecting against claims of IP infringement or fraud. While the clause does not explicitly mention these issues, the context implies that there are mechanisms in place to address them, which may be detailed in the referenced indemnification sections.

4. **Negligence and Willful Misconduct**: The clause states that liability is limited ""even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages,"" which suggests a broad waiver of liability. However, it does not explicitly mention gross negligence or willful misconduct. Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific legal context, such exclusions may not be enforceable, as many legal systems do not allow parties to waive liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In summary, while the clause effectively limits liability for indirect damages, it does not explicitly address third-party IP infringement, fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. Therefore, if those issues are a concern, it would be prudent to ensure that the agreement includes specific language that either excludes these types of claims from the limitation of liability or provides for indemnification in those scenarios.",4

1. **Exclusion of Liability for Indirect Damages**: 
   - Section 27.2 explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, or consequential damages related to a purchase order. This aligns with the concept of a damage waiver, as it limits liability for certain types of damages that could arise from the agreement.

2. **Exceptions for Gross Negligence and Willful Misconduct**: 
   - Section 27.1 clarifies that the limitations on liability do not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This is significant because it means that while the parties are waiving liability for indirect damages, they are still held accountable for serious breaches of duty, which could include actions that might lead to third-party IP infringement or fraud.

3. **Acknowledged Direct Damages**: 
   - Section 27.3 acknowledges that damages resulting from breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or data security obligations are considered direct damages. This suggests that while indirect damages are waived, there are specific areas where liability is maintained, which could potentially include IP-related issues if they fall under these categories.

4. **Limitation of Liability for Specific Parties**: 
   - Sections 27.4 and 27.5 outline the limitations of liability for both parties (VF and Supplier) concerning damages arising from the purchase order. This indicates that while there are caps on liability, there are also specific obligations (like indemnification and confidentiality) that are not subject to these limitations, which could encompass IP infringement scenarios.

In summary, this clause effectively establishes a framework for limiting liability for indirect damages while maintaining accountability for serious misconduct and specific obligations. It does not explicitly mention third-party IP infringement, but the structure of the clause suggests that such issues could be addressed under the exceptions for gross negligence or willful misconduct, as well as under the acknowledged direct damages for breaches of confidentiality or data security.",5

Specifically, it states that neither party shall be liable for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, as well as loss of profits or revenues arising from the agreement or any breach thereof.

In the context of your query regarding a ""personal or bodily injury exception to indirect damage waiver,"" this clause is particularly relevant for the following reasons:

1. **General Waiver of Liability**: The clause broadly waives liability for indirect damages, which typically includes personal or bodily injury claims. This means that, under normal circumstances, the parties would not be held liable for such claims, which could be considered indirect damages.

2. **Indemnification Provision**: The clause includes a provision that states the waiver does not limit a party's obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties. This could imply that if a third party were to assert a claim for personal or bodily injury, the indemnification obligation may still apply, even if the direct liability for indirect damages is waived.

3. **Scope of Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that the waiver applies regardless of the negligence or fault of the party whose liability is being waived. This reinforces the strength of the waiver but also raises questions about how personal or bodily injury claims would be treated, as these types of claims often involve considerations of negligence.

4. **Potential Exceptions**: While the clause does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury as an exception to the waiver, in many legal contexts, personal injury claims are treated differently from other types of indirect damages. Therefore, it may be necessary to interpret or negotiate the clause further to clarify whether personal or bodily injury claims are indeed exempt from this waiver.

In summary, while the clause generally waives liability for indirect damages, including personal or bodily injury, it also contains provisions that could allow for exceptions, particularly in the context of third-party claims. It would be prudent for the parties to explicitly address personal or bodily injury claims in the agreement to avoid ambiguity and ensure that both parties understand their rights and obligations in such scenarios.",4

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages**: Section 9.2 explicitly states that neither party will be liable for incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including injury to property, as a result of a breach of the agreement. This indicates a broad waiver of liability for indirect damages, which typically encompasses economic losses that do not arise directly from a breach.

2. **Tort Claim Waiver**: Section 9.5 further elaborates on the waiver of rights to recover economic losses or damages under tort theories, including negligence. However, it specifically notes that this waiver does not apply to ""personal injury or damage to other tangible property."" This is crucial because it creates an exception to the general waiver of liability for economic losses, allowing claims for personal injury to proceed despite the limitation on liability for other types of damages.

3. **Personal Injury Exception**: The mention of personal injury in Section 9.5 indicates that while the parties are waiving liability for economic losses and indirect damages, they are not waiving liability for personal injuries. This aligns with common legal principles where personal injury claims are often treated differently from economic or consequential damages, as they involve physical harm to individuals rather than financial loss.

4. **Implications for Liability**: The clause establishes that while the parties have limited their liability for many types of damages, they have intentionally carved out an exception for personal injury claims. This means that if a party suffers a personal injury as a result of the other party's actions or negligence, they retain the right to seek damages for that injury, despite the broader waiver of liability for other types of damages.

In summary, the clause is relevant to the query as it outlines the limitations on liability while also explicitly preserving the right to claim for personal injuries, thereby creating a clear exception to the general waiver of indirect damages.",5

Specifically, it addresses the following points that are relevant to your query about the personal or bodily injury exception to an indirect damage waiver:

1. **Exclusion of Incidental and Consequential Damages (Section 9.2)**: This section states that neither party will be liable for incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including economic losses such as lost profits or business. However, it explicitly mentions that this exclusion includes ""injury to property,"" which suggests that the waiver of liability does not extend to personal injury or bodily injury claims. This is significant because it indicates that while economic damages are waived, personal injury claims are not covered by this limitation.

2. **Tort Claim Waiver (Section 9.5)**: This section further clarifies that each party waives the right to recover economic losses or damages under tort theories, including negligence, misrepresentation, and strict liability. However, it specifically states that this waiver does not apply to ""personal injury or damage to other tangible property."" This reinforces the idea that personal injury claims are exempt from the limitations of liability outlined in the agreement.

3. **Overall Intent of the Clause**: The clause as a whole indicates that while the parties are limiting their liability for certain types of damages, they are intentionally excluding personal injury claims from this limitation. This is a common practice in contracts to ensure that parties retain the right to seek compensation for bodily injuries, which can have significant implications and are often treated differently under the law.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it explicitly outlines the exceptions to the indirect damage waiver, particularly emphasizing that personal or bodily injury claims are not subject to the limitations of liability set forth in the agreement. This means that parties can still pursue claims for personal injury despite the general waiver of liability for other types of damages.",5

Here's how it relates to your query about the personal or bodily injury exception to the indirect damage waiver:

1. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: Clause 27.2 explicitly states that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, or consequential damages related to a purchase order, even if those damages are foreseeable. This is a typical provision in contracts to limit liability for indirect damages.

2. **Exceptions to Limitations**: However, Clause 27.1 provides an important exception to the limitation of liability. It states that the provisions do not exclude or limit liability in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, death, or personal injuries caused by negligence or willful misconduct. This means that if a party's actions lead to personal injury or death, they cannot invoke the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility.

3. **Personal Injury Exception**: The mention of ""personal injuries caused by negligence or willful misconduct"" in Clause 27.1 directly addresses your query. It indicates that any claims related to personal or bodily injury are exempt from the indirect damage waiver. Therefore, if a party is found to be negligent or engaged in willful misconduct that results in personal injury, they cannot limit their liability for those damages.

4. **Overall Impact**: The combination of these clauses ensures that while parties may limit their liability for indirect damages, they cannot escape liability for serious issues such as personal injuries. This is a critical aspect of contract law, as it protects individuals from being left without recourse in the event of harm caused by another party's negligence or intentional wrongdoing.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it clearly delineates the boundaries of liability concerning indirect damages while explicitly preserving the right to claim for personal injuries, thereby ensuring that such claims are not subject to the same limitations.",5

Both Parties acknowledge that they are experienced in negotiating agreements of this sort, and have had the advice of counsel in connection with, and fully understand the nature of, the waiver contained in this Section 14","The clause provided, titled ""Waiver of Non-compensatory Damages,"" is relevant to the query regarding a personal or bodily injury exception to an indirect damage waiver because it outlines the limitations on the types of damages that can be claimed between the parties involved in the agreement.

1. **Scope of Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that both parties waive their rights to claim punitive or exemplary damages in any action or proceeding related to the agreement. This indicates a clear intention to limit the types of damages that can be pursued, which typically includes indirect damages.

2. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The waiver of punitive or exemplary damages can be interpreted as part of a broader indirect damage waiver. Indirect damages often refer to losses that are not a direct result of a breach but arise as a consequence of it. By waiving the right to claim certain types of damages, the parties are effectively limiting their exposure to indirect damages as well.

3. **Personal or Bodily Injury Exception**: The clause does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury claims. However, in many legal contexts, waivers of indirect damages do not apply to personal injury claims, as these are often treated separately due to public policy considerations. Therefore, while the clause limits certain types of damages, it may not preclude claims related to personal or bodily injury, which are typically exempt from such waivers.

4. **Legal Understanding**: The clause indicates that both parties are experienced and have had legal counsel, suggesting that they understand the implications of waiving certain damages. This understanding is crucial when considering whether personal or bodily injury claims would be affected by this waiver.

In summary, while the clause limits the types of damages that can be claimed, it does not explicitly address personal or bodily injury claims, which may still be pursued despite the waiver of indirect damages. This distinction is important in interpreting the overall impact of the waiver on potential claims arising from the agreement.",4

Specifically, it states that neither party (nor their affiliates, officers, directors, and employees) will be liable for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages suffered by the other party under the agreement, regardless of the cause or whether the possibility of such damages was foreseeable.

In relation to the query about confidentiality exceptions to the indirect damage waiver, this clause is relevant because it establishes a general rule that limits liability for indirect damages. However, it also includes important exceptions:

1. **Indemnification Provisions**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply to amounts payable to third parties under the indemnities provided in other sections of the agreement (specifically, Article 10, Sections 16.1 and 16.2). This means that if there are indemnification obligations related to confidentiality breaches, those would not be subject to the indirect damage waiver.

2. **Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct**: The clause also notes that the limitation of liability does not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This implies that if a party breaches confidentiality in a manner that constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct, they could be held liable for indirect damages.

In summary, while the clause generally waives liability for indirect damages, it provides exceptions that could allow for recovery in cases involving indemnification obligations or serious misconduct. This is crucial for understanding the scope of liability in the context of confidentiality breaches.",5

It states that neither party can recover special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages in connection with the agreement, which is a common provision in contracts to limit exposure to indirect damages.

However, the clause includes an important exception: it specifies that the limitation of liability does not apply to breaches of Article 8, which pertains to confidentiality. This means that if one party breaches the confidentiality provisions outlined in Article 8, the other party retains the right to seek special, incidental, or consequential damages as a remedy for that breach. 

This is particularly relevant to your query about confidentiality exceptions to the indirect damage waiver because it highlights that while the parties generally waive their rights to claim indirect damages, breaches of confidentiality are treated differently. The parties are allowed to pursue such damages if confidentiality obligations are violated, thus providing a safeguard for sensitive information and ensuring that parties are held accountable for breaches of confidentiality.

In summary, the clause is relevant because it explicitly carves out an exception to the general waiver of indirect damages in the context of confidentiality breaches, allowing for potential recovery of such damages in those specific circumstances.",5

This waiver is significant in the context of confidentiality exceptions because it establishes the limitations on liability for damages that may arise from breaches of confidentiality obligations.

In relation to your query about confidentiality exceptions to the indirect damage waiver, the clause indicates that while parties are waiving liability for indirect damages, there is a specific exception for obligations related to indemnifying, defending, and holding harmless the other party against claims from unaffiliated third parties. This means that if a breach of confidentiality leads to a claim from a third party, the party responsible for the breach may still be liable for those claims, even if the general waiver of indirect damages applies.

Thus, the relevance of this clause to your query lies in its clarification that while indirect damages are generally waived, there are exceptions, particularly concerning third-party claims, which could include breaches of confidentiality. This creates a nuanced understanding of liability in the context of confidentiality breaches, ensuring that parties are aware that they may still face liability in certain circumstances despite the broader waiver of indirect damages.",5

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Breach of Confidentiality**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply to damages arising from a party's breach of confidentiality obligations (as outlined in Article 12). This means that if one party breaches its confidentiality obligations, it can be held liable for consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, which are typically waived under this clause for other types of claims.

2. **Indemnification Obligations**: Similarly, the clause also makes an exception for indemnification obligations (as outlined in Article 11). This indicates that if a party is required to indemnify the other party due to a breach of confidentiality or other specified obligations, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for those damages.

3. **Scope of Liability**: The clause establishes a general framework for liability, indicating that, except for the specified exceptions (breach of confidentiality and indemnification), neither party will be liable for indirect damages. This highlights the importance of confidentiality in the agreement, as breaches in this area are treated with greater severity and allow for full liability.

In summary, this clause delineates the boundaries of liability for both parties under the agreement, specifically emphasizing that breaches of confidentiality are significant enough to warrant full liability, including for indirect damages, which would otherwise be waived. This is crucial for parties to understand their rights and potential liabilities concerning confidentiality breaches.",5

This limitation applies except for the confidentiality obligations and indemnification obligations set forth in the agreement.

In the context of your query regarding confidentiality exceptions to the indirect damage waiver, this clause is particularly relevant because it explicitly states that the confidentiality obligations are exempt from the limitation of liability. This means that if either party breaches their confidentiality obligations, they cannot invoke the waiver of liability for indirect damages. In other words, if a party's breach of confidentiality leads to indirect damages, they may still be held liable for those damages despite the general waiver of liability for indirect damages.

Thus, the clause establishes a clear boundary where confidentiality breaches are treated differently from other types of breaches, allowing for potential recovery of indirect damages in cases where confidentiality is compromised. This is important for parties to understand, as it emphasizes the significance of maintaining confidentiality and the potential consequences of failing to do so.",5

Here’s how it relates to your query about the carveout for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct in the context of an indirect damage waiver:

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause begins with a general prohibition against consequential damages, stating that neither party will be liable for lost profits, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of the agreement. This is a common provision in contracts to limit liability for indirect damages that may arise from a breach.

2. **Carveouts for Specific Conduct**: However, the clause explicitly carves out exceptions to this waiver. It states that the limitation on liability does not apply in cases of:
   - A party's fraud
   - A party's gross negligence
   - A party's willful misconduct

   This means that if a party engages in any of these behaviors, they cannot rely on the indirect damage waiver to avoid liability for damages that may arise from such actions. This is significant because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct simply by including a broad waiver of indirect damages.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also references indemnification obligations, which are another area where liability limitations may not apply. This further emphasizes that parties are still accountable for certain types of damages and misconduct, even when they have agreed to limit their liability in other respects.

4. **Legal and Equitable Remedies**: The external information you provided also discusses the right to seek equitable remedies (like injunctions) in the event of breaches, which aligns with the idea that certain serious breaches (like fraud or gross negligence) warrant more than just monetary damages.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations on liability for indirect damages while simultaneously providing important exceptions for serious misconduct, ensuring that parties cannot evade responsibility for actions that could cause significant harm. This balance is crucial in contract law to protect parties from being unfairly disadvantaged by the other party's wrongful actions.",5

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause explicitly states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages. This is a common provision in contracts to limit liability for damages that are not directly caused by a breach or failure to perform.

2. **Carveouts for Specific Misconduct**: The clause includes specific carveouts that allow for liability in cases of:
   - **Fraud**: If a party commits fraud, they cannot rely on the indirect damage waiver to avoid liability for damages resulting from that fraud.
   - **Gross Negligence**: Similarly, if a party is grossly negligent, they are also not protected by the waiver from liability for damages that arise from that gross negligence.
   - **Willful Misconduct**: The same applies to willful misconduct; a party cannot escape liability for damages resulting from their intentional wrongdoing.

3. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also mentions that the limitations on liability do not apply to indemnification obligations. This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for losses arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the indemnifying party cannot limit their liability under the indirect damage waiver.

4. **Legal Framework**: The references to applicable law and the potential for irreparable harm (as seen in the external information) suggest that the parties recognize the seriousness of these exceptions. They acknowledge that certain actions (like fraud or gross negligence) can cause significant harm that cannot be adequately addressed through monetary damages alone.

In summary, this clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations on liability for indirect damages while simultaneously providing important exceptions for serious misconduct, ensuring that parties cannot evade responsibility for their wrongful actions.

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: Section 11.6 establishes a general rule that neither party will be liable for indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the agreement. This is a common provision in contracts to limit liability for damages that are not directly caused by a breach or failure to perform.

2. **Carveout for Specific Conduct**: The clause explicitly carves out exceptions to this waiver of liability. It states that the limitation on liability does not apply in cases of:
   - A party's fraud
   - A party's gross negligence
   - A party's willful misconduct

   This means that if one party engages in fraudulent behavior, acts with gross negligence, or commits willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the indirect damage waiver to avoid liability for the resulting damages. This is significant because it ensures that parties cannot escape accountability for serious misconduct that causes harm to the other party.

3. **Liability Limitations**: Section 11.7 further reinforces this by stating that the aggregate liability of a party for claims arising out of the agreement is limited, but again, this limitation does not apply to claims arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This ensures that parties are held accountable for their most egregious actions, regardless of the general limitations on liability.

1. **Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause states that both parties agree to waive claims for various forms of indirect damages, including consequential, punitive, incidental, and special losses. This aligns with the concept of an indirect damage waiver, which typically seeks to limit liability for damages that are not directly caused by a breach of contract.

2. **Carveout for Gross Negligence and Willful Misconduct**: The clause includes a specific exception (or carveout) for claims that arise from a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. This means that if one party engages in gross negligence or willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the waiver of indirect damages to shield themselves from liability for those specific claims. This is a common legal principle that ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious wrongdoing.

3. **Relevance to Fraud**: While the clause does not explicitly mention fraud, it is often treated similarly to gross negligence and willful misconduct in legal contexts. If a party's actions constitute fraud, they may also fall outside the scope of the waiver, allowing the other party to seek damages.

In summary, this clause is directly relevant to the query as it establishes a framework for how indirect damages are treated in the context of the agreement, while also providing exceptions for serious misconduct, thereby ensuring that parties cannot evade responsibility for significant breaches of duty.",5

1. **General Indirect Damage Waiver**: The clause begins by stating that, unless expressly provided otherwise, neither party will be liable for special, indirect, punitive, incidental, or consequential damages. This establishes a broad waiver of liability for indirect damages, which is a common provision in contracts to limit exposure to potentially large and unpredictable claims.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: Importantly, the clause includes a carveout that states the limitation of liability does not apply in cases of ""gross negligence or willful misconduct."" This means that if one party engages in gross negligence or willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the waiver to avoid liability for indirect damages. 

3. **Relevance to Fraud**: While the clause does not explicitly mention fraud, it is often treated similarly to gross negligence and willful misconduct in legal contexts. Therefore, if fraud is involved, the party committing the fraud may also be held liable for indirect damages despite the general waiver.

4. **Legal Implications**: This carveout is significant because it ensures that parties cannot escape liability for serious wrongdoing, thereby providing a level of protection for the other party against egregious conduct. It reinforces the principle that while parties may agree to limit their liability for certain types of damages, they cannot contract out of responsibility for their most serious misdeeds.

It explicitly states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for consequential damages, including lost profits, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the agreement. 

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **Indirect Damages Waiver**: The clause includes a clear waiver of liability for indirect damages, which is relevant to your query about whether such a waiver applies to a party's liability for fraud, negligence, or personal injury. The clause states that the waiver of consequential damages applies ""in no event"" to claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that while the parties have waived liability for indirect damages in general, they have carved out exceptions for serious misconduct, including fraud and gross negligence.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause specifically lists exceptions to the waiver of indirect damages, which include:
   - A party's fraud
   - A party's gross negligence
   - A party's willful misconduct
   - Indemnification obligations under Article 12

   This indicates that if a party commits fraud or is grossly negligent, they cannot rely on the waiver to avoid liability for indirect damages. Therefore, the waiver does not apply to these serious breaches of duty.

3. **Implications for Personal Injury**: While the clause does not explicitly mention personal injury, claims for personal injury often arise from negligence. Given that the waiver does not apply to gross negligence or willful misconduct, it can be inferred that if a party's actions lead to personal injury due to negligence or gross negligence, they may still be liable for damages, including indirect damages, depending on the circumstances.

4. **Overall Liability Limitations**: Section 11.7 further limits a party's aggregate liability under the agreement, but again, it specifies that this limitation does not apply to claims arising from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This reinforces the idea that serious breaches of duty are treated differently under the agreement.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the clause establishes a waiver of indirect damages but explicitly excludes liability for fraud, gross negligence, and willful misconduct from this waiver. Therefore, if a party engages in such conduct, they cannot escape liability for indirect damages, which directly addresses your query regarding the applicability of the indirect damages waiver to a party's liability for fraud, negligence, or personal injury.",5

### Key Points from the Clause:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**:
   - This section explicitly states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the agreement. 
   - The exceptions to this waiver include damages arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This means that if a party commits fraud or acts with gross negligence or willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the waiver of indirect damages to limit their liability.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**:
   - This section further clarifies that a party's aggregate liability is limited, but again, there are exceptions. Specifically, the limitations on liability do not apply to claims arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.
   - This reinforces the idea that for serious breaches of duty, such as fraud or gross negligence, the parties cannot escape liability through the indirect damages waiver.

### Conclusion:
The clause clearly delineates that while there is a general waiver of liability for indirect damages, this waiver does not extend to claims involving fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. Therefore, if a party engages in such conduct, they remain liable for indirect damages, contradicting the general waiver. This is crucial for understanding the limits of liability in the context of serious breaches of conduct, ensuring that parties cannot shield themselves from accountability for their most egregious actions.",5

1. **Indirect Damages Waiver**: Section 11.6 explicitly states that, with certain exceptions, neither party will be liable for any lost profits, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the agreement. This indicates a broad waiver of liability for indirect damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause lists specific exceptions where the waiver does not apply:
   - **Fraud**: The waiver does not apply to damages arising from a party's fraud.
   - **Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct**: The waiver also does not apply to damages resulting from a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
   - **Indemnification Obligations**: Additionally, the waiver does not apply in connection with a party's indemnification obligations.

3. **Implications for Liability**: This means that if a party commits fraud, is grossly negligent, or engages in willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the indirect damages waiver to limit their liability. Therefore, they may be held liable for indirect damages in such cases.

4. **Negligence and Personal Injury**: While the clause specifically mentions gross negligence, it does not explicitly address ordinary negligence or personal injury. However, since the waiver is limited to gross negligence and willful misconduct, it suggests that ordinary negligence may still be subject to the indirect damages waiver unless otherwise specified in the agreement.

In summary, the clause establishes a clear framework for liability limitations while also delineating exceptions for serious misconduct, including fraud and gross negligence. This directly addresses your query by clarifying that the indirect damages waiver does not apply to a party's liability for fraud or gross negligence, and it implies that ordinary negligence may also be treated differently depending on the context of the agreement.",5

Here's how it relates to your query regarding the applicability of an indirect damages waiver to a party's liability for fraud, negligence, or personal injury:

1. **Exclusions for Gross Negligence and Willful Misconduct**: Section 27.1 explicitly states that the limitations on liability do not apply in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, death, or personal injuries caused by negligence or willful misconduct. This means that if a party engages in fraudulent behavior or is grossly negligent, they cannot rely on the indirect damages waiver to limit their liability.

2. **Indirect Damages Waiver**: Section 27.2 establishes that neither party will be liable for special, indirect, or consequential damages related to a purchase order. However, this waiver is limited by the exceptions noted in Section 27.1. Therefore, while the parties may waive liability for indirect damages in general, this waiver does not extend to situations involving fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury.

3. **Direct Damages Acknowledgment**: Section 27.3 clarifies that damages resulting from breaches of confidentiality, privacy, or data security obligations are considered direct damages and are not subject to the indirect damages waiver. This reinforces the idea that certain types of damages, particularly those arising from serious misconduct or breaches of specific obligations, are not limited by the waiver.

4. **Limitation of Liability for Each Party**: Sections 27.4 and 27.5 outline the specific limitations of liability for both parties, indicating that there are caps on the amount of damages that can be claimed, except in cases of indemnification obligations or breaches of confidentiality. This further emphasizes that while there are limitations, they do not apply in cases of serious misconduct.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query because it clearly delineates the boundaries of liability for indirect damages while also establishing that such waivers do not apply in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or personal injury. This means that a party cannot escape liability for these serious issues simply by invoking an indirect damages waiver.",5

ARTICLE 10","The clause you provided, specifically Section 9.5 titled ""Limitation of Liability,"" is highly relevant to your query regarding whether an indirect damages waiver applies to a party's liability for fraud, negligence, or personal injury.

1. **General Indirect Damages Waiver**: The clause states that, with certain exceptions, neither party nor its affiliates or sublicensees shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, remote, exemplary, or speculative damages. This indicates a broad waiver of liability for indirect damages, which typically includes damages that are not a direct result of a breach or wrongdoing.

2. **Exceptions to the Waiver**: The clause explicitly outlines exceptions to this waiver:
   - **Fraud**: The waiver does not apply in the event of a party's fraud. This means that if one party commits fraud, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for indirect damages resulting from that fraud.
   - **Breach of Specific Obligations**: The waiver also does not apply to breaches of obligations under Article 7 (Intellectual Property) or Article 10 (Confidentiality). This suggests that if a party breaches these specific obligations, they may also be liable for indirect damages.

3. **Negligence and Personal Injury**: While the clause does not explicitly mention negligence or personal injury, the general legal principle is that waivers of liability for negligence may not be enforceable in all jurisdictions, especially in cases involving personal injury. Therefore, while the clause limits liability for indirect damages, it does not provide a blanket protection against all forms of liability, particularly in cases of negligence or personal injury, unless explicitly stated.

In summary, the clause establishes a general waiver of liability for indirect damages but carves out exceptions for fraud and specific breaches. This means that a party cannot escape liability for indirect damages if they commit fraud, and it raises questions about the enforceability of such waivers in cases of negligence or personal injury, depending on jurisdictional laws.",5

Section 9.1 Indemnification and Claims Procedure.
(a) Indemnification. Each party hereto agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party and its employees, officers, directors, agents and assigns from and against any and all loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees), damage, injury or liability, whether incurred as a party or non-party to any action or proceeding, that may arise out of any actual or threatened claim asserted or action brought by or on behalf of a third party for injury to or death of a person for loss of or damage to property, including employees and property of the indemnified party (""Loss""), to the extent resulting directly or indirectly from the indemnifying party's actual or alleged (i) breach of a duty, representation, or obligation of this Agreement, or (ii) negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such indemnification is void or otherwise unenforceable under applicable law in effect on or validly retroactive to the date of this Agreement.
(b) Claims Procedure. Promptly after receipt by either party hereto (the ""Indemnitee"") of any notice of any demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would or might give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an ""Asserted Liability"") that may result in a Loss, the Indemnitee shall give notice thereof (the ""Claims Notice"") to the party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a). The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnitee. Thereafter, the following procedures shall apply:
(1) Subject to Section 9.1(b)(2), 9.1(b)(3), 9.1(b)(4) and 9.1(b)(5), the indemnifying party may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense by its own counsel, and shall control any such compromise or defense;
(2) If the indemnifying party elects to compromise or defend such Asserted Liability it shall (i) within thirty (30) days after confirmed receipt of the Claims Notice notify the Indemnitee of its intent to do so, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate, at the expense of the indemnifying party, in the compromise of, or defense against, such Asserted Liability, and shall make available to the indemnifying party any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, (ii) select counsel and, if applicable, consultants and contractors, reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee in connection with conducting the defense of such Asserted Liability, and (iii) defend or settle such Asserted Liability in consultation with Indemnitee, including, without limitation, consulting Indemnitee on litigation strategy and keeping Indemnitee reasonably informed of all proceedings and settlement demands and negotiations;
(3) The indemnifying party shall not consent to a settlement of any such Asserted Liability without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that the indemnifying party may enter into a settlement without the consent of Indemnitee after providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Indemnitee if the terms of such settlement (x) include only money damages as a remedy and such money damages are paid in full by the indemnifying party, (y) do not impose material obligations or restrictions on Indemnitee's business and (z) do not include any admission of wrongdoing by Indemnitee;

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee and the indemnifying party may participate, in all instances, and at their own expense, in the defense of any Asserted Liability.","The clause provided outlines the indemnification obligations between the parties, specifically addressing how one party (the indemnifying party) agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party (the indemnified party) from losses arising from claims related to personal injury or property damage. This is particularly relevant to your query regarding the ""personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout.""

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **Indemnification for Personal Injury**: The clause explicitly states that the indemnifying party is responsible for indemnifying the other party against claims for ""injury to or death of a person"" and ""loss of or damage to property."" This indicates that personal or bodily injury claims are included within the scope of indemnification, which is crucial when considering exceptions to waivers of indirect damages.

2. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: While the clause does not directly address a waiver of indirect damages, it implies that the indemnification obligations are separate from any limitations on liability that might exist elsewhere in the agreement. If there is a general waiver of indirect damages in the contract, the indemnification for personal injury claims could serve as an exception to that waiver. This means that even if indirect damages are waived, claims for personal injury would still be indemnified.

3. **Carveout for Indemnification**: The clause can be interpreted as a carveout from any general limitations on liability. If the agreement contains a provision that limits liability for indirect damages, the indemnification obligations for personal injury claims would likely be an exception to that limitation. This is important for ensuring that parties are still held accountable for serious claims, such as those involving bodily injury, despite any broader waivers.

4. **Claims Procedure**: The detailed claims procedure outlined in the clause ensures that the indemnified party has a clear process to follow in the event of a claim, which is essential for managing risks associated with personal injury claims. This procedure reinforces the importance of the indemnification obligation and provides a structured approach to addressing such claims.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it establishes the parties' obligations regarding personal injury claims, which may serve as an exception to any waivers of indirect damages. It highlights the importance of indemnification in protecting against serious claims, ensuring that parties cannot escape liability for personal injury through general limitations on damages.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout,469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The clause you provided, specifically Section 24.0 on General Indemnification, is relevant to your query regarding the personal or bodily injury exception to the waiver of indirect damages via an indemnification carveout for several reasons:

1. **Indemnification for Bodily Injury**: The clause explicitly states that each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party from claims arising out of bodily injury (including death). This indicates that the parties have agreed to a specific carveout for bodily injury claims, meaning that such claims are not subject to the general waiver of indirect damages that might apply to other types of claims.

2. **Negligence and Intentional Acts**: The clause covers claims arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors. This further emphasizes that if bodily injury occurs due to negligence or intentional wrongdoing, the indemnifying party is responsible for indemnifying the other party, regardless of any general waivers of liability that might exist in the contract.

3. **Allocation of Fault**: The clause also includes a provision for the allocation of damages if the indemnified party's or a third party's actions contributed to the injury. This means that even if there is shared responsibility, the indemnification obligation remains intact for bodily injury claims, which is a critical aspect of the carveout.

4. **Exclusivity of Defense**: The indemnifying party is granted the exclusive right to defend or settle claims, which is a common feature in indemnification clauses. This ensures that the indemnifying party has control over how to handle claims related to bodily injury, which can be significant in managing liability and potential damages.

5. **Prompt Notification and Cooperation**: The clause requires the indemnified party to promptly notify the indemnifying party of any claims and to cooperate in the defense. This procedural aspect is important for ensuring that the indemnification process is followed correctly and that the parties can effectively manage any claims related to bodily injury.

In summary, this indemnification clause provides a clear exception for bodily injury claims, ensuring that such claims are not subject to the general waivers of indirect damages that might apply to other types of claims. It establishes the responsibilities of each party in the event of a bodily injury claim and outlines the process for handling such claims, making it a critical component in the context of your query.",5

1. **Section 12.3 - No Liability for Consequential Damages**:
   - This section states that no party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. 
   - However, it explicitly carves out an exception for obligations related to indemnification in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses, the limitation on liability for consequential damages does not apply. 

2. **Section 12.4 - Limitation on Liability**:
   - This section sets a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of each party for any causes of action, regardless of whether they arise from contract or tort (including negligence).
   - It indicates that the liability is limited to a specified amount, which is to be filled in the placeholder [* * *].

### Relevance to Your Query:

- **Personal or Bodily Injury Exception**: The clause does not explicitly mention personal or bodily injury, but the indemnification carveout in Section 12.3 suggests that if personal or bodily injury falls under the definition of ""Indemnifiable Loss,"" then the limitation on liability for consequential damages would not apply. This means that if one party is liable for personal or bodily injury, they may still be required to indemnify the other party without the limitation on consequential damages affecting that obligation.

- **Indemnification Carveout**: The mention of indemnification in Section 12.3 indicates that the parties have agreed to a broader scope of liability when it comes to indemnifiable losses, which could include personal or bodily injury claims. This is significant because it allows for recovery beyond the limitations set forth in the agreement for those specific types of claims.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the limitations on liability while also providing an exception for indemnification obligations. If personal or bodily injury claims are categorized as ""Indemnifiable Loss,"" the parties would not be able to rely on the waiver of indirect damages in those instances, thus allowing for potential recovery for such claims despite the general limitations on liability.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout,980a304336,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits. This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided, specifically Sections 12.3 and 12.4, addresses the limitation of liability and the exclusion of certain types of damages, which is relevant to your query regarding the personal or bodily injury exception to the waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout.

1. **Section 12.3 - No Liability for Consequential Damages**: This section states that no party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. However, it explicitly carves out an exception for obligations related to indemnification in connection with any ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if a party is required to indemnify the other party for certain losses, the limitation on liability for indirect damages does not apply. 

   In the context of personal or bodily injury, if such injuries are considered ""Indemnifiable Losses,"" then the waiver of indirect damages would not apply. This is significant because it allows for recovery of damages related to personal or bodily injury, which are typically not classified as indirect or consequential damages.

2. **Section 12.4 - Limitation on Liability**: This section further limits each party's maximum aggregate liability to a specified amount for all causes of action, including those arising from contract or tort. However, it does not specify any exceptions for personal or bodily injury claims. 

   The relevance here is that while the clause limits liability, it does not negate the possibility of claims for personal or bodily injury, which may fall outside the scope of the limitations set forth in these sections. If personal or bodily injury claims are not considered ""indirect"" or ""consequential,"" they may still be actionable despite the limitations imposed by these sections.

In summary, the clause is relevant to your query because it establishes a framework for liability limitations while also indicating that indemnification obligations (potentially including personal or bodily injury claims) are exempt from the waiver of indirect damages. This creates a scenario where parties may still be held liable for certain types of damages, particularly those related to personal or bodily injury, despite the general limitations on liability for indirect damages.",5
personal or bodily injury exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout,0eabff6ea5,"14.4 Indemnification You shall indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent by law us, our affiliates and our respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, and agents, (collectively the ""Indemnitees"") from any and all losses and expenses (as hereinafter defined) incurred in connection with any litigation or other form of adjudicatory procedure, claim, demand, investigation, or formal or informal inquiry (regardless of whether same is reduced to judgment) or any settlement thereof which arises directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in connection with your operation of the Franchised Business including, but not limited to, claims arising as a result of the maintenance and operation of vehicles (collectively an ""event""), and regardless of whether same resulted from any strict or vicarious liability imposed by law on the Indemnitees; provided, however, that this indemnity shall not apply to any liability arising from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees (except to the extent that joint liability is involved, in which event the indemnification provided herein shall extend to any finding of comparative negligence or contributory negligence attributable to you). For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term ""losses and expenses"" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses. You shall give us prompt notice of any event of which you are aware for which indemnification is required and, at your expense and risk, we may elect to assume (but under no circumstance are obligated to undertake) the defense and/or settlement thereof, provided that we will seek your advice and counsel. Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.","The clause provided, specifically Section 14.4 on Indemnification, is relevant to your query regarding the personal or bodily injury exception to the waiver of indirect damages via an indemnification carveout for several reasons:

1. **Indemnification Scope**: The clause outlines the indemnification obligations of one party (presumably the franchisee) to indemnify and hold harmless the other party (the franchisor and its affiliates) from any losses and expenses incurred in connection with claims arising from the operation of the franchised business. This includes claims related to the maintenance and operation of vehicles, which could encompass personal or bodily injury claims.

2. **Exclusion of Gross Negligence**: The clause specifies that indemnification does not apply to liabilities arising from the gross negligence of the Indemnitees. This is significant because it suggests that if a claim arises from personal or bodily injury due to the gross negligence of the Indemnitees, the indemnification would not cover those claims. This creates a carveout that could be interpreted as an exception to the waiver of indirect damages.

3. **Definition of Losses and Expenses**: The clause defines ""losses and expenses"" to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages, which could encompass damages awarded in personal injury cases. This broad definition indicates that the indemnifying party may be responsible for a wide range of damages, but the exception for gross negligence implies that certain serious claims (like those arising from personal injury due to gross negligence) would not be indemnified.

4. **Legal Defense Obligations**: The clause also places the obligation on the indemnifying party to defend against claims, which may include personal injury claims. This further emphasizes the importance of the indemnification provision in the context of potential bodily injury claims arising from the franchised business operations.

5. **Implications for Waiver of Indirect Damages**: If the agreement includes a waiver of indirect damages, the presence of this indemnification clause, particularly with its exceptions, suggests that personal or bodily injury claims may not be subject to the same waiver. This could mean that while indirect damages may be waived in other contexts, claims related to personal injury could still be pursued, especially if they do not fall under the gross negligence exception.

In summary, this indemnification clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the responsibilities and limitations regarding indemnification for claims, including personal or bodily injury, and highlights the exceptions that may apply, particularly concerning gross negligence. This interplay is crucial in understanding how waivers of indirect damages might be affected by the indemnification obligations in the contract.",5

Here's how it connects:

1. **General Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for various types of damages, including consequential, incidental, indirect, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, arising out of or relating to the agreement. This establishes a broad waiver of indirect damages between the parties.

2. **Exception for Third-Party Claims**: The clause includes a critical exception: it specifies that the waiver of liability does not limit a party's obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties. This means that while the parties waive their rights to claim indirect damages against each other, they still retain the responsibility to address claims from third parties, which may include indirect damages.

3. **Implications for First Party Claims**: The query refers to a ""first party claim exception,"" which suggests a concern about whether there are any exceptions to the waiver of indirect damages for claims made by one party against the other (as opposed to third-party claims). The clause does not explicitly provide an exception for first-party claims regarding indirect damages, indicating that such claims would generally fall under the waiver.

4. **Legal Interpretation**: In legal contexts, the interpretation of such waivers can be complex. If a party were to argue that there should be an exception for first-party claims, they would need to rely on other provisions in the agreement or legal principles that might allow for such an interpretation. However, based solely on the language of this clause, it appears that the waiver of indirect damages applies broadly to both parties' claims against each other.

In summary, the clause establishes a clear waiver of indirect damages between the parties while allowing for third-party claims, but it does not indicate any specific exception for first-party claims. This could be a point of negotiation or clarification in the context of the agreement.",5

This is a typical waiver of indirect damages in contracts, aimed at limiting liability for certain types of losses that may arise from a breach of the agreement.

In the context of your query regarding a ""first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages,"" this clause is particularly relevant because it establishes the baseline for what types of damages are excluded from claims. If a party is seeking to assert a first-party claim that falls under the category of indirect damages, this clause would serve as a barrier to that claim, as it explicitly waives the right to seek such damages.

However, if there are exceptions to this waiver (which may be outlined elsewhere in the contract), those exceptions would need to be clearly defined. For instance, if the contract includes provisions that allow for specific types of claims or damages that are not considered indirect (such as direct damages or damages arising from willful misconduct), those would be relevant to the query. 

In summary, the clause sets the framework for liability and damages, and understanding its implications is crucial for determining whether a first-party claim can be made despite the waiver of indirect damages. If the claim does not fall under the exceptions, it would likely be barred by this clause.",5

Here's how it connects:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that, with certain exceptions, neither party shall be liable for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages. This means that if one party suffers losses that are not directly caused by the other party's actions (such as lost profits or revenue), they generally cannot claim those damages.

2. **Exceptions to the Limitation**: The clause includes an important exception: it states that the limitation of liability does not apply to ""the extent that such limitation of liability is contrary to the Applicable Law"" or if such damages have been awarded to a third party under a third-party claim. This indicates that if the law allows for recovery of indirect damages or if a third party successfully claims such damages, the first party may still be liable despite the general waiver.

3. **First Party Claims**: The query specifically mentions ""first party claims,"" which refer to claims made by one party against the other under the contract. The clause suggests that while the parties have waived their rights to claim indirect damages from each other, there may be circumstances (such as legal requirements or third-party claims) where this waiver does not hold.

4. **Legal Context**: The mention of ""Applicable Law"" implies that if local laws or regulations provide for the recovery of certain types of damages, the waiver in this clause may not be enforceable. This is crucial for understanding the limits of the waiver and the potential for first-party claims to still be valid under certain legal frameworks.

In summary, Section 13.4 establishes a general waiver of indirect damages between the parties but also outlines exceptions that could allow for first-party claims in specific situations, particularly where legal obligations or third-party claims are involved. This makes it essential for parties to consider the legal context and potential exceptions when assessing their rights and liabilities under the contract.",5

In the context of your query regarding a ""first party claim exception to waiver of indirect damages,"" this clause is particularly relevant because it establishes the baseline for liability and the types of damages that are waived. However, the clause also includes a specific exception: ""EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO OBLIGATIONS TO INDEMNIFY A PARTY FOR CLAIMS MADE BY THIRD PARTIES."" This indicates that while the parties waive their rights to claim indirect damages from each other, they still retain the right to seek indemnification for claims made by third parties, which could potentially include indirect damages arising from those claims.

In essence, if a first party (one of the parties to the agreement) faces a claim from a third party that results in indirect damages, the waiver of indirect damages does not apply to the extent that the first party is seeking indemnification from the other party for those third-party claims. This creates a scenario where the first party can still pursue compensation for indirect damages, but only in the context of indemnification related to third-party claims, thus creating an exception to the general waiver of indirect damages outlined in the clause. 

This distinction is crucial for understanding the limits of liability and the rights of the parties under the agreement, particularly in situations where third-party claims are involved.",5

However, the clause also specifies exceptions to this waiver, particularly in cases of bodily injury, property damage, or willful misconduct, where direct damages can be claimed.

If a first party (the party making the claim) seeks to argue that they should be able to recover indirect damages despite the waiver, they would need to demonstrate that their claim falls within one of the exceptions outlined in the clause. For example, if the claim involves willful or intentional misconduct by the other party, the first party may argue that the waiver of indirect damages does not apply, allowing them to seek recovery for those damages.

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**: This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising from the agreement. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for certain situations, including:
   - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: The clause states that damages arising from a party's fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct are not subject to the limitation on consequential damages. This means that if one party engages in such conduct, they can be held liable for indirect damages resulting from that conduct.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**: Similar to Section 11.6, this section limits a party's aggregate liability under the agreement but also includes exceptions. Notably, it states that the limitation does not apply to:
   - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: Again, this reinforces that if a party commits fraud, acts with gross negligence, or engages in willful misconduct, they can be held liable beyond the specified limits.

### Relevance to the Query:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**:
   - This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for indirect damages, including lost profits, special, incidental, or consequential damages. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for certain situations, including:
     - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: The clause states that if a party engages in fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, they are not protected by the limitation on liability. This means that if one party commits such acts, they can be held liable for indirect damages that would otherwise be waived.
     - **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also notes that the limitations on liability do not apply to a party's indemnification obligations under Article 12. This means that if a party is required to indemnify the other party for certain claims, they cannot limit their liability in the same way as for other types of damages.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**:
   - Similar to Section 11.6, this section sets a cap on the aggregate liability of each party but includes exceptions for:
     - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: Again, if a party is found to have acted with fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the liability cap does not apply. This reinforces the idea that parties cannot escape liability for serious misconduct.
     - **Indemnification Obligations**: The liability limit does not apply to indemnification obligations, ensuring that parties remain accountable for their indemnification responsibilities regardless of the liability cap.

3. **Indemnification Provisions (Sections 12.1 and 12.2)**:
   - These sections outline the indemnification responsibilities of each party. They specify that each party will indemnify the other for claims arising from breaches of the agreement, including those resulting from negligence, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct. This further emphasizes that parties are responsible for their actions and cannot limit their liability in cases of serious wrongdoing.

### Conclusion:
The clause is highly relevant to your query as it clearly delineates the exceptions to the waiver of indirect damages in the context of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. It establishes that such actions will not allow a party to escape liability for indirect damages and reinforces the importance of indemnification obligations. This framework ensures that parties are held accountable for serious breaches of conduct while also providing a structured approach to liability and indemnification in the agreement.",5

This is highly relevant to your query regarding the exceptions for fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct in relation to the waiver of indirect damages and indemnification carveouts.

### Key Points of Relevance:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 11.6)**:
   - This section establishes that, generally, neither party will be liable for indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages arising from the agreement. However, it explicitly carves out exceptions for certain scenarios, including:
     - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: This means that if a party engages in fraudulent behavior, acts with gross negligence, or commits willful misconduct, they cannot rely on the limitation of liability to avoid responsibility for indirect damages. This directly addresses your query about the exception to the waiver of indirect damages.

2. **Liability Limit (Section 11.7)**:
   - This section further limits a party's aggregate liability under the agreement but again includes exceptions. Notably, it states that the limitation does not apply to:
     - **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: Similar to Section 11.6, this reinforces that parties cannot limit their liability for these serious breaches of conduct.
     - **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause also specifies that the limitations on liability do not apply to indemnification obligations, which is crucial in the context of your query regarding indemnification carveouts.

### Conclusion:
The clause is relevant because it outlines the framework for liability and the specific exceptions that allow for recovery of indirect damages in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. It also clarifies that indemnification obligations are not subject to the same limitations, ensuring that parties can seek full recourse in these serious situations. This aligns with the legal principles surrounding indemnification and liability in contracts, making it a critical component of the agreement.",5
"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout",469b92fa2b,"24.0 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION Each party shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the other, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), including without limitation, those based on contract or tort, arising out of or in connection with a claim, suit or proceeding brought by a third party based upon bodily injury (including death) or damage to tangible personal property (not including lost or damaged data) arising from the negligent or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnifying party or its subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them. In the event that the indemnified party's or a third party's negligent or intentional acts or omissions contributed to cause the injury or damage for which a claim of indemnity is being asserted against the indemnifying party hereunder, the damages and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) shall be allocated or reallocated, as the case may be, between the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and any other party bearing responsibility in such proportion as appropriately reflects the relative fault of such parties, or their subcontractors, or the officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns of any of them, and the liability of the indemnifying party shall be proportionately reduced.
The foregoing indemnification obligations are conditioned upon the indemnified party promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, suit or proceeding for which the indemnifying party is obligated under this Section 24, cooperating with, assisting and providing information to, the indemnifying party as reasonably required, and granting the indemnifying party the exclusive right to defend or settle such claim, suit or proceeding.","The clause provided, titled ""GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION,"" is relevant to your query regarding the exception to the waiver of indirect damages in the context of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Indemnification Obligations**: The clause establishes that each party has an obligation to indemnify and hold harmless the other party from claims, losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses arising from negligent or intentional acts or omissions. This is crucial because it sets the foundation for liability in cases of misconduct.

2. **Scope of Indemnification**: The clause specifies that indemnification applies to claims based on both contract and tort, which includes situations where a party's actions may be deemed fraudulent, grossly negligent, or willfully misconductful. This means that if one party engages in such behavior, they may be held liable for damages that arise from those actions.

3. **Allocation of Fault**: The clause includes a provision for the allocation of damages based on the relative fault of the parties involved. This is particularly relevant in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, as it allows for a nuanced approach to liability, ensuring that the party at fault bears an appropriate share of the damages.

4. **Exclusion of Certain Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention a waiver of indirect damages, it implies that the indemnification obligations may cover direct damages resulting from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. This could serve as a carveout to any general waiver of indirect damages that might be present elsewhere in the agreement.

5. **Prompt Notification and Cooperation**: The clause requires the indemnified party to promptly notify the indemnifying party of any claims and to cooperate in the defense. This is important in the context of fraud or gross negligence, as timely action can be critical in mitigating damages and addressing misconduct.

In summary, the ""GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION"" clause is relevant to your query as it outlines the responsibilities and liabilities of the parties in cases of misconduct, potentially serving as an exception to any general waivers of indirect damages that may exist in the contract. It emphasizes the importance of accountability for actions that could lead to significant harm, thereby reinforcing the legal framework for addressing fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.",5
"fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct exception to waiver of indirect damages via indemnification carveout",eb935e4d2e,"12.3 No Liability for Consequential Damages. No party will be liable to any other for any indirect, consequential, or special damages or for loss of profits. This limitation does not, however, apply to any obligation of either party to indemnify the other in connection with any Indemnifiable Loss.
12.4 Limitation on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, each party's maximum aggregate liability to the other party for any and all causes whatsoever, and each party's remedy, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or tort, including negligence, and whether or not pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in Section 12 and whether or not such party is notified of the possibility of damage to the other party, shall be limited to $[* * *].","The clause you provided, specifically Sections 12.3 and 12.4, is relevant to your query regarding the exceptions to the waiver of indirect damages through an indemnification carveout in the context of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

### Breakdown of the Clause:

1. **Section 12.3 - No Liability for Consequential Damages**:
   - This section establishes that no party will be liable for indirect, consequential, or special damages, including loss of profits. 
   - However, it explicitly states that this limitation does not apply to obligations related to indemnification for ""Indemnifiable Loss."" This means that if one party is required to indemnify the other for certain losses, the limitation on liability for indirect damages does not apply in those cases.

2. **Section 12.4 - Limitation on Liability**:
   - This section sets a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of each party to the other for any causes of action, regardless of whether the claim arises from contract or tort (including negligence).
   - It indicates that the liability is limited to a specified amount, which is to be filled in (denoted by $[* * *]).

### Relevance to Your Query:

- **Indemnification Carveout**: The clause indicates that while there is a general waiver of liability for indirect damages, this waiver does not apply when it comes to indemnification obligations. This is crucial because it means that if a party is indemnifying another for losses that may arise from fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, the indemnifying party may still be liable for those indirect damages despite the general waiver.

- **Fraud, Gross Negligence, or Willful Misconduct**: In many legal agreements, parties often carve out exceptions for serious misconduct such as fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct. The indemnification obligations in this clause suggest that if one party engages in such conduct, the other party may seek indemnification for losses that could include indirect damages, which would typically be waived under normal circumstances.

### Conclusion:

In summary, the clause you provided establishes a framework where the general waiver of liability for indirect damages is overridden in the context of indemnification. This is particularly relevant when considering claims related to fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, as it allows for the possibility of recovering indirect damages in those specific situations.",5

In no event will Seller's entire liability to Buyer, including any liability in the event the exclusive remedy set forth in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose, exceed the purchase price actually paid by Buyer for the products hereunder, or any defective portion thereof, whichever is the lesser amount.","The clause you provided, titled ""Limitation of Liability,"" is highly relevant to the query regarding seller-favorable waivers of indirect damages. Here’s how it connects:

1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages. This is a clear waiver of claims that could arise from indirect consequences of a breach, which is a seller-favorable position. It protects the seller from a wide range of potential liabilities that could arise from the sale of products, thereby limiting their exposure to financial risk.

2. **Scope of Liability**: The clause further limits the seller's liability to the purchase price actually paid by the buyer for the products, or any defective portion thereof. This cap on liability is another seller-favorable aspect, as it ensures that the seller's maximum financial responsibility is confined to a predetermined amount, regardless of the nature or extent of the damages claimed by the buyer.

3. **Legal Protection**: By including such a limitation of liability clause, the seller is seeking to protect itself from extensive claims that could arise from various legal theories, including statutory causes of action. This broad language reinforces the seller's position and minimizes the risk of significant financial repercussions.

4. **Alignment with Seller Interests**: The overall structure of the clause aligns with the interests of the seller by limiting potential liabilities and providing a clear framework for what the seller is responsible for in the event of a breach. This is particularly important in commercial agreements where the seller wants to mitigate risks associated with unforeseen consequences of their products or services.

In summary, this clause serves as a protective measure for the seller, waiving indirect damages and capping liability, which is precisely what the query is focused on regarding seller-favorable waivers of indirect damages.",5

Specifically, it states that neither party's liability for breaches of the agreement will exceed a specified amount (USD 13 million), with certain exceptions for claims arising from bad faith, intentional misconduct, or third-party claims for personal injury or property damage.

This clause is relevant to the query regarding seller-favorable waivers of indirect damages for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause effectively caps the financial exposure of both parties, which is a common practice in contracts to protect against excessive claims. This is particularly favorable to the seller, as it limits their potential liability in the event of a breach.

2. **Exclusions from Liability Cap**: The clause specifies exceptions to the limitation of liability, which include bad faith and intentional misconduct. This is important because it means that while the seller is protected from indirect damages and has a cap on liability, they are still accountable for serious breaches of conduct. This balance can be seen as favorable to the seller, as it allows them to avoid liability for less severe breaches.

3. **Indirect Damages**: The clause does not explicitly mention indirect damages, but by limiting liability to a specific amount and excluding certain types of claims, it implicitly waives claims for indirect damages that might otherwise arise from breaches. This is beneficial for the seller, as it reduces the risk of facing claims for consequential or punitive damages that could exceed the liability cap.

4. **Negotiation Leverage**: Including such a clause can be a point of negotiation in favor of the seller, as it provides them with a clear framework for liability that can be presented as a protective measure during contract discussions.

In summary, this clause is relevant to the query as it reflects a seller-favorable approach to liability by limiting exposure to direct damages and implicitly waiving claims for indirect damages, while still maintaining accountability for serious breaches.",5

Here's how:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**: This section explicitly states that neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of the agreement. This is a seller-favorable provision because it limits the seller's liability for damages that are not directly caused by their actions or breaches. By waiving liability for these types of damages, the seller protects themselves from potentially significant financial exposure that could arise from claims related to lost profits, revenue, or business opportunities that the buyer might assert.

2. **Limitation of Damages (Section 8.3)**: This section further limits the aggregate liability of either party in connection with the agreement. By capping the liability, the seller can manage their risk and exposure in the event of a breach or other issues arising from the contract. This is particularly favorable for the seller, as it ensures that their maximum financial responsibility is predetermined and limited.

3. **Indemnification Exceptions**: The clause includes exceptions for indemnification claims and breaches of confidentiality, which are common in contracts. This means that while the seller is waiving liability for indirect damages, they still have to account for certain liabilities that could arise from specific breaches, which is a standard practice to protect the interests of the parties involved.

By excluding these types of damages, the seller limits their potential exposure to claims that could arise from indirect consequences of their actions or products.

2. **Direct Damages Cap**: The clause also sets a cap on direct damages, stating that the liability for direct damages shall not exceed fifteen million dollars. This further protects the seller by limiting the maximum amount they could be liable for, which is a common seller-favorable provision in contracts.

3. **Exclusions for Third-Party Claims**: The clause makes an exception for claims by third parties for injury or damages to persons or tangible property directly caused by any product. This means that while the seller is waiving indirect damages, they still retain some liability for direct damages that could arise from third-party claims, which is a standard practice to ensure that the seller is not completely shielded from all forms of liability.

Here's how it relates to your query:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly states that neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. This is beneficial for the seller because it protects them from claims that could arise from unforeseen or indirect consequences of their actions or failures under the agreement.

2. **Scope of Damages**: By listing specific types of damages (e.g., loss of profits, business interruption, loss of data), the clause clearly defines the types of claims that are excluded. This helps the seller avoid potentially large and unpredictable liabilities that could arise from indirect damages.

3. **Cap on Liability**: The clause also includes a cap on total liability, stating that it shall not exceed the amounts paid or payable by the buyer under the applicable order during the preceding twelve months.

4. **Seller-Favorable Position**: Overall, this clause is designed to favor the seller by minimizing their risk and potential financial exposure in the event of a breach or other issues arising from the contract.

Here’s how it connects:

1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that the seller shall not be liable for indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages. This means that if the buyer suffers losses that are not directly caused by the seller's actions (such as lost profits or damage to business reputation), they cannot claim compensation from the seller. This is a common practice in contracts to limit liability, but it is generally more favorable to the seller than the buyer.

2. **Buyer’s Position**: From a buyer's perspective, such waivers can be unfavorable because they limit the buyer's ability to recover damages that may arise from the seller's breach of contract. If the buyer incurs significant indirect damages due to a failure in the seller's performance, they would be unable to seek compensation for those losses under this clause.

3. **Negotiation Considerations**: In negotiations, a buyer may seek to modify or eliminate such waivers to ensure they have recourse for indirect damages, especially if those damages could be substantial. A buyer-favorable waiver would allow the buyer to retain the right to claim for indirect damages, which could be critical in certain transactions.

4. **Legal Context**: The clause also mentions that the waiver is to the fullest extent permitted by law, which indicates that there may be legal limits to how much liability can be waived. Buyers may want to ensure that any waivers are not overly broad or unenforceable under applicable law.

Here's how it connects:

1. **No Consequential Damages (Section 8.2)**: This section explicitly states that neither party will be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of the agreement. This is a common clause in contracts that limits liability for damages that are not directly caused by a breach of the contract. For a buyer, this clause can be unfavorable because it limits their ability to recover damages that may arise from a seller's breach, particularly those that are not immediately apparent but could have significant financial implications (e.g., loss of profits, business interruption).

2. **Limitation of Damages (Section 8.3)**: This section further limits the aggregate liability of either party to a specified amount, which is typically a cap on the total damages that can be claimed. This can be particularly concerning for a buyer, as it restricts their potential recovery in the event of a breach, regardless of the actual damages incurred.

In the context of a buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages, the buyer would typically seek to negotiate terms that either eliminate or significantly reduce these limitations. They may want to ensure that they can recover for indirect damages that could arise from a breach, especially if those damages are foreseeable or if they are critical to the buyer's business operations.

Overall, the clauses as they stand are more favorable to the seller, as they limit the seller's liability and protect them from extensive claims for indirect damages.

This clause is relevant to the query about ""buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages clauses"" in the following ways:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause effectively caps the financial exposure of both parties, which can be seen as a buyer-favorable provision if the buyer is comfortable with the limit and believes it adequately protects them against potential losses. However, it also limits the seller's liability, which may not be favorable to the buyer if the buyer anticipates significant risks.

2. **Exclusions for Certain Claims**: The clause explicitly states that the limitation of liability does not apply to claims arising from bad faith or intentional misconduct. This is important for the buyer, as it allows them to pursue full damages in cases of egregious behavior by the seller, which is a protective measure for the buyer.

3. **Indirect Damages**: While the clause does not explicitly mention indirect damages, it implies a limitation on liability that could encompass indirect damages, depending on how the terms are interpreted. A buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages would typically seek to ensure that the buyer can recover for consequential losses that arise from a breach, which may not be fully covered under this clause.

4. **Negotiation Leverage**: If the buyer is seeking to negotiate a more favorable waiver of indirect damages, they might argue for a higher cap on liability or broader definitions of what constitutes recoverable damages, especially in light of the exceptions for bad faith and intentional misconduct.

1. **Waiver of Indirect Damages**: The clause explicitly states that neither party shall be liable for various types of indirect damages, including consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, or punitive damages. This is a typical feature of waivers of indirect damages, which are often included in contracts to limit liability and protect parties from extensive financial exposure due to indirect consequences of a breach.

2. **Buyer-Favorable Perspective**: In a buyer-favorable context, the clause could be seen as problematic for the buyer, as it limits the buyer's ability to claim damages that may arise from the seller's breach of contract. Buyers typically prefer to have some recourse for indirect damages, especially if those damages could be significant and arise from the seller's failure to perform.

3. **Indemnification Exception**: The clause includes a provision that allows for indemnification against claims asserted by unaffiliated third parties. This means that while the parties waive their rights to claim indirect damages against each other, they still have a mechanism to protect themselves from third-party claims, which could be beneficial for the buyer in certain situations.

4. **Broad Scope of Waiver**: The clause also states that the waiver applies regardless of the circumstances, including negligence or fault of the party whose liability is being waived. This broad scope can be particularly concerning for a buyer, as it limits their ability to seek redress even in cases where the seller may have acted negligently.

In summary, this clause represents a significant limitation on liability for indirect damages, which may not be favorable to a buyer. Buyers typically seek to negotiate such clauses to ensure they have adequate protection against potential losses that could arise from a seller's breach of contract.",4

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 9 HEREOF, THE LIABILITY OF A PARTY TO THE OTHER FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. EXCLUSIVE OF ANY CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES FOR INJURY OR DAMAGES TO PERSONS OR TANGIBLE PROPERTY DIRECTLY CAUSED BY ANY PRODUCT, NEITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ADVERTISING MATERIALS, IF ANY, WILL INCLUDE CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, EVEN IFTHE OTHER PARTY HAS KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.","The clause provided is relevant to the query regarding buyer-favorable waivers of indirect damages because it outlines the limitations of liability between the parties involved in the agreement. Specifically, it states that neither party's liability will include consequential, incidental, special, or other indirect damages, such as lost profits, even if the other party is aware of the potential for such damages. 

In the context of a buyer-favorable waiver of indirect damages, this clause is significant for several reasons:

1. **Limitation of Liability**: The clause explicitly limits the liability of each party to direct damages only, capping it at fifteen million dollars. This is a common practice in contracts to protect parties from extensive financial exposure due to indirect damages, which can be difficult to quantify and prove.

2. **Exclusion of Indirect Damages**: By waiving claims for indirect damages, the clause protects the seller (or the party not seeking damages) from liability for losses that are not directly caused by their actions. This is particularly favorable for sellers, as it reduces their risk and potential financial liability.

3. **Buyer Considerations**: For a buyer, this clause may be seen as unfavorable because it limits their ability to recover for indirect damages that could arise from a breach of the agreement. Buyers typically prefer to have broader rights to claim damages, including indirect damages, to ensure they are fully compensated for any losses incurred.

4. **Negotiation Leverage**: If a buyer is seeking a more favorable position, they may negotiate to either remove this waiver of indirect damages or to include exceptions where indirect damages could be claimed, particularly in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In summary, this clause is a critical component of the agreement that directly impacts the allocation of risk and liability between the parties, making it a focal point for discussions around buyer-favorable waivers of indirect damages.",4
