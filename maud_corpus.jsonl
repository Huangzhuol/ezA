Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the obligation to adjourn or postpone such meeting as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, (x) the BancorpSouth Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of BancorpSouth at the BancorpSouth Meeting, and (y) the Cadence Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Cadence at the Cadence Meeting, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve either BancorpSouth or Cadence of such obligation.
